Kiss,Korn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/korn/kiss.html,"Some deny and search for things that never come around
Do I feel like a fool?
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared
And I owe this all to you

I'm feeling like I'm sinking
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

The last thing I would like to do before I go away
is cry there next to you (next to you)
Cry and talk about the good old days and where they've gone
And now how much I hate you

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

I feel the blood drip off my body as it falls right there
on the ground
What am I now?

What am I now?
What am I now?

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away",2007
Cure For the Enemy,Billy Talent,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billytalent/curefortheenemy.html,"Time drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads

We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spend the time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

We said that we would call
But we never spoke at all
The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
For reasons that seem so small
If this is the end, let's bury the past
This might be our one last chance
Together until the last grain of sand
Has dropped from the hourglass

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy
All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to breath
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(Count the days down to one last breath)
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(So forgive what you can't forget)
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

In darkness we'll rest",2012
Rainin' You,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/raininyou.html,"When I looked out today
And saw that the sky was gray
I thought about the way
You loved days like this

And driving in to town
It really started coming down
Bringing me back around
To all that I miss

It feels like it's rainin' you
It feels like it's rainin' you

I didn't even run inside
Or worry about staying dry
Besides there nowhere I can hide
These feeling now

Running down my face
Takes me to another place
I can't think of a better way to drown

It feels like it's rainin' you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's rainin' you

If I had my way
It would do this every day
I would never see the sun
Because the closest I get
To holding you again
Is every time that sky opens up

It feels like it's rainin' you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's rainin' you
It feels like it's rainin' you",2005
Who You'd Be Today,Kenny Chesney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennychesney/whoyoudbetoday.html,"Sunny days seem to hurt the most.
I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
I feel you everywhere I go.
I see your smile, I see your face,
I hear you laughin' in the rain.
I still can't believe you're gone.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who'd you be today?

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family,
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue,
I feel like I can talk to you,
An' I know it might sound crazy.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who you'd be today?

Today, today, today.
Today, today, today.

[Instrumental Break]

Sunny days seem to hurt the most.
I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
The only thing that gives me hope,
Is I know I'll see you again some day.

Some day, some day, some day.",2005
Looking In,Mariah Carey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariahcarey/lookingin.html,"You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say, ""She takes it all for granted""
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well, here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me",1995
Homesick,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/homesick.html,"Hey hey!
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet
It was wild
And oh how we...
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey
Cling to me
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home

Oh just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home",1989
My Precious,Lifehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lifehouse/myprecious.html,"can't hold you down

don't worry your time
don't hurry your mind
where did you go
where did you hide
all I can do
is watch you pass by
climb up above
your precious time
don't worry your time
don't hurry your mind
every time I try to take it back
I know I don't wanna live like that
I'll wait for tomorrow
too tired to go the other way
too late to wait another day
I'm going on
climb up above
your precious time
don't worry your time
don't hurry your mind
climb up above
your precious time
don't worry your time
don't hurry your mind",2003
I Miss My Sky (Amelia Earhart's Last Days),Heather Nova,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heathernova/imissmyskyameliaearhartslastdays.html,"I bury myself in the leaves to sleep
The sun so strong and rage so deep 
I keep waking to find I've been dreaming again
And the sound of the ocean is not a plane 
And far away they talk about me
In newspaper columns they write about me
round dinner tables and cocktail parties
I'm a heroine and a tragic figure
I'm a heroine as I'm lying here
Beneath my sky

And sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Why we're always coming down
And why we need to touch the ground
And why I didn't keep on heading
right on up to heaven
I miss my sky

Here from below the clouds are shadows
Not the golden mountains I used to fly through
Here from below the sky?s a painting 
In a child's room with the future waiting
But not for me

I look up at the birds flying overhead
My sentinel's true but the signals dead
It's been 500 days of hope and sorrow
500 nights with no tomorrow
And the poetry and the best of me
And the heart and the spirit and the sex of me
All fell into the azure sea
In the tailspin with the last of me
And my wings, and my song, all that I knew is dead and gone
I'm weak and tired but my will is strong
And my hope lives on, my hope lives onS

But sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Why we're always coming down
Why we need to touch the ground
Why I didn't keep on heading
Right on up to heaven
I miss my sky
I miss my sky",2005
Calm After the Storm,The Common Linnets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/commonlinnets/calmafterthestorm.html,"Driving in the fast lane
Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind

Livin' in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can't be for you

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry?

I could say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm",2014

Reason,Fool's Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/foolsgarden/reason.html,"Bye, bye -
It's the same old wind again that calls me
- bye, bye -
on an ordinary day.
Bye, bye -
have you ever felt this lack of freedom
- bye, bye -
have you ever felt this way.

Leave it, don't leave it - I have to leave,
I can't go on pretending.
Nothing is real, don't you feel
that every road is ending.
Don't ask why i have to leave you,
don't you try, there have to be two.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand,
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

I've said it all - holy eyes -
no more sweet surrender.
Forget it all - no more lies,
soon we will remember that
everything we tried to change
stayed always and always and always 
the same.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand,
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we cannot walk each other way.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

There's a light inside the hollow,
there's a light behind the wall,
but we've got different lights to follow,
we have to fall, so let us fall.

I was afraid - I couldn't hear you,
I was ashamed but now I know
that we got different roads to follow,
that we got different ways to go.

We will never find a reason.
wWe will never find a reason.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

there's a light behind the wall,

Why Does It Hurt So Bad,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/whydoesithurtsobad.html,"[Chorus:]
Why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
Thought I was over you 
But I keep crying 
When I don't love you 
So why does it hurt so bad 
I thought I had let you go 
So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
It hurts so bad 
Oh it hurts so bad baby 

My life's been better 
Since the day I left you boy 
I must admit life's been kind to me 
I went and did the things I said I would boy 
I found someone who loves me for me 
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy 
My heart's never been more at ease 
And when I think of all the things you put me through 
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
I thought I was over you 
But I keep crying 
When I don't love you

So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
Hurts me so bad 
Hurts so (yeah you do) 
Hurts so (hurts me so) 
Hurts so bad (did you know) 
Hurts so (that it hurts me so) 
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh) 

""Never again"" that's what I said to myself 
I never wanna feel kind of pain again boy 
Just when I think it's over 
Just when I think it's through 
I find myself right back in love with you

So why does it hurt so bad oh baby 
Why do I feel so sad 
(thought I thought I) Thought I was over you 
I keep crying 
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy) 
(oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me) 
So why does it hurt so bad 
I thought I had let you go (thought I could let you go) 
You could 
Gotta get you outta my head 
Boy you hurt me so bad 
Hurts so (yeah you do) 
Hurts so (hurt me so) 
Hurts so bad (hurts so) 
Hurts so (sure you did)

Shadows and Regrets,Yellowcard,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yellowcard/shadowsandregrets.html,"I'm back, back in town
And everything has changed
I feel, feel let down
The faces stay the same
I see, see shadows
Of who we used to be
When I drive, drive so slow 
Through this memory

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest 

I heard, heard myself
Say things I take back
If I could, could retell
And make these stories last
I see, see shadows
Of who you'll always be
I drive, drive these roads
Made of memories

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go from the rest
Shadows and regrets
We let go from the rest 

Everything has changed
Faces stay the same
Everything has changed
Faces stay the same

And we were only kids 
And our time couldn't end 
And how tall did we stand 
With the world in my hands 
And we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest
And shadows and regrets
We let go of the rest

We Can't Be Friends,Deborah Cox,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deborahcox/wecantbefriends.html,"To just act like we never were

Verbally we agreed 
It was over and we were through

But I just can't get over you girl 

[Chorus:]
We can't be friends 
We can't be friends 
We can't be friends 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 

I went by Mother's, saw your car there 
To her you're still family, and it don't seem fair 
For everyone to just go on 
And I've tried and I can't do it 
'Cause I'm still torn 
I've tried to think of you 
As just another love in my past 
That didn't last 
But it's not that simple baby 

[Chorus]

You may see me staring 
Or catch me in a daze 
May see me hang my head 
When you come my way 
Don't get too close to me 
And expect me to behave 
I might just steal a kiss 
If you come near my face 
What I'm trying to say

En un atardecer
En la brisa o en la flor
Esperando tu regreso

Quiet As A Mouse,Margot & the Nuclear So and So's,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/margotthenuclearsoandsos/quietasamouse.html,"Tourists rob you of your home 
In sunken boats
You can hide quiet as a mouse
But they'll find you out

When she asked me, ""Why have you felt so down and out?
You can stay with me at my house.""

When I woke my back was broke from lying on the floor
Sunlight poured through all the cracks in my front door
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

Tourists robbed me of my child
They smoked him out
He was draft dodging some war
Until they found him out

He came home late in the night
To his mom and me
And he said, ""Times they gotta change,
But so do we.""

When I woke I was alive in somebody's room
I felt life and love and hope infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

When I woke my body was dying all over the floor
I felt apathy and hate infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you",2006

Driving the lonely road

Humming a sad forgotten song
Wasting all our time
That you're spending with someone else

[Bridge]

Satiate my mind
And calm my nerves to look and find
Words that aren't enough
And never show a single piece of my mind

Happiness,Dance Gavin Dance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dancegavindance/happiness.html,"Drowning in the lake
I only left her for a couple of seconds

And now she's gone

Waking up for what?
As I pace back and forth
Maybe it's time to move away
But what would that prove anyway?

Listening to the answering machine
Over and over
Only to hear your voice one more time
Just one more time

It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)
[x2]

ohhh whoaaa ohhh..

Beg me for directions
Like I have all the answers
I neglected her life
Now what, what do I do with mine?

Listening to the answering machine
Over and over
Only to hear your voice one more time
Just one more time

It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)

No Regrets,Girls Aloud,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/girlsaloud/noregrets.html,"No regrets if just a few
Somehow they're entwined with you
No regrets I'm glad it's through and you
Left my mind

Rainy Sundays, kids TV
Fish and chips in NYC
You said we were meant to be
To be

Those super bossa nova nights
Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last
For all eternity

No regrets, no memories
Just forget those heart felt pleas
No regrets, no baby
Not for me

Those super bossa nova nights
Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last
For all eternity

No regrets, no memories
Just forget those heart felt pleas
No regrets, no baby
Not for me

Not for me
Not for me",2005
Deform to Form a Star,Steven Wilson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevenwilson/deformtoformastar.html,"Oh once in a while
I learn how to smile
Horses shadows and rain on stone

No god here I'm sure
This must be the cure
For all this carrion and aimless drift

Retreat from the begging
And invites to the wedding
Revelation means nothing here

In time we forget our
Need to devour
All the stories of tortured souls

Crawl into your arms
Become the night forever
Coiled and close, the moment froze
Deform to form a star
Here on earth together
I got time to share and a well used stare

This smile isn't pure
Certain or sure
Cold precision was never there

The way we uncoil
Return to the soil
Flaws are everything and chaos reigns",2011
Rite of Spring,Angels & Airwaves,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/angelsairwaves/riteofspring.html,"I was locked all day in the summer heat,
In a small brown house in Suburban Street,
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I'd dream all day that they would get me far,
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen, 
Got kicked out of school, and so it seemed
that things were closing in and ready to blow,
My dad moved out about that year or so,
It took an hour to start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I held my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for has come to pass
From Rock N Roll, to love and cash
Itâs all success if itâs what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside

That I am here, and that I am alive

The whole wide world is mine

Save Your Love,Great White,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatwhite/saveyourlove.html,"I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream you'll always be
Till the end of time

I look in your eyes they touch my soul
My love is hard to hide
I'm never alone when we're apart
I feel you by my side

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
I know who you are
So lock the door and throw away the key

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

I wake from a dream
And see you by my side
How could I belong to someone else
When holding you feels so right?

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
We've made it so far
So lock the door and throw away the key

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I need

I know who you are
We've come so far
So baby stay with me

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I need (I need)

Mockingbird,Low Millions,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lowmillions/mockingbird.html,"Here come the nightingales, or could it be the mockingbird, they're at my windowsill, they flew in as
soon as they heard.
Enter the doctor and the nurse, say my condition's getting worse, they take my pulse and shake their
heads, they recommend I stay in bed.
They say you are my condition, you are indecision, you, what is wrong with you?

You say you love me but you don't love me, you say you hate me but you don't hate me, you say you'd
leave me but you can't leave me, because you love me, what's it gonna be, what is wrong with you, what
is wrong with me.

Here goes nothing, I just swallowed the pill, the room's spinning out of control, although I'm lying
still. And those mockingbirds, they're hovering above, they're talking about the trouble with our love.

You say you love me but you don't love me, you say you hate me but you don't hate me, you say you'd
leave me but you can't leave me, because you love me, what's it gonna be, what is wrong with you, what
is wrong with me.

Oh my God, I think I've actually lost the plot. Oh my God, my brain is fried and my nerves are shot.
And why not, you say control me no don't control me, you say hold me no don't hold me, you say you'd
marry me, but you can't marry me.

Because you love me but you don't love me, because you hate me but you don't hate me, because you'd

He Never Got Enough Love,Lucinda Williams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lucindawilliams/henevergotenoughlove.html,"His mama ran off when he was just a kid
So he never really knew her at all
Just a picture of a girl in a sad blue dress
Hanging beside a cross on the wall
His daddy used to drive those eighteen wheelers
Now he drives the bottle deep into the night
He was always saying son, you're just no good
You'll never do anything right
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
The screams and the bruises and the broken bottles
These were things he understood
From busted chairs to a broken heart
He got away as soon as he could
When he was just eighteen he got his very own gun
Shot a kid near a liquor store one night
He was all mixed up he never understood why
He was only lookin' to prove his daddy right
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love",1992
I'd Be Better Off in a Pinebox,Doug Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dougstone/idbebetteroffinapinebox.html,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Girl I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back from Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind",1990
If Only Your Eyes Could Lie,Aaron Tippin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aarontippin/ifonlyyoureyescouldlie.html,"Girl I can tell
You're thinkin' of leavin'
But it'll hurt me so much
You don't want me to know
You've done all you can
To hide what your feelin'
But one part of you let your feelings show

Oh your finger tips
Tell me you'll stay
And your tender lips
Say you won't go away
Your lovin' arms
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie

So I say what's wrong
And you say its nothing
I can almost believe it
When I hold you like this

But I know in my heart
That there's no tomorrow
But just for tonight
I'll pretend that there it

Oh your finger tips
Tell me you'll stay
And your tender lips
Say you won't go away
Oh your lovin' arms
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie",ompi
Then Again,Alabama,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alabama/thenagain.html,"We could walk away now, call it over and done
Say we fought the good fight and nobody won
Say we're both better off that worst came to worst
So we didn't last, hey, we're not the first

But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die 
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
And find the love we had back then again

Off to such a good start but somehow it seems
We've let our hearts fall apart at the dreams
We could throw in the towel walk away with our pride
Say it just wasn't worth all the tears that we've cried

But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die 
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again

Maybe if we want it bad enough
We can make it better than it ever was
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again...",
The Little Girl,John Michael Montgomery,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmichaelmontgomery/thelittlegirl.html,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name
Never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off
Cause He was there in my old house
And held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died",2000
The Walk,Sawyer Brown,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sawyerbrown/thewalk.html,"Down our long dusty driveway
I didn't want to go
But I set out with tears in my eyes wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked out at the school bus and his little man and said
""Don't worry boy it will be all right""

[CHORUS:]
Cause I took this walk you're walking now
Boy, I've been in your shoes
You can't hold back the hands of time
It's just something you've got to do
So dry your eyes I understand just what you're going through
Cause I took this same walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes

Down our long dusty driveway
I set my mind to go
I was eighteen and wild and free and wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked at the world and at his grown man and said,
""Don't worry boy it will be all right""

Down our long dusty driveway
This time we both would go
He had grown old and gray
And his mind was wandering
Daddy took me by the hand
Said, ""I know where we're going and I understand
Don't worry boy it will be all right""

If I Die Young,The Band Perry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bandperry/ifidieyoung.html,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in a river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh, uh oh

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh,
And life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger,
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...

...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?
I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh (uh, oh)
The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls.",2010

Stuck inside a circumstance with your confusion and your blame.

And when I get drunk, you take me home and keep me safe from harm.
When I get drunk, you take me home.

I ask you for another second chance, but then I drink it all away.
And I get bellicose when you react full of frustration and dismay.
I was so delicate when we began, so tender when I spoke your name.
But now I'm nothing but a partisan to my compulsion and my shame.

You know, I'm grateful, I appreciate.
But in fact, it's baleful how I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.

I love you more than any man, but I seem to lay it all to waste.
I do you harm because I can with a joke in questionable taste.
I've such duplicity at my command, so I keep on lying to your face,
Then I run away to wonderland, and disappear without trace.

You know, I'm grateful, I appreciate..
But, in fact, it's baleful how I suck you dry.

How Could You put him up to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How Could You put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How Could You How Could You just forget about me?

[Verse:]
You must be out ya mind,
You got alot of nerve (to think that im gone chill after all the shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for ya,
(I kno ur sick about) the way I found you out,
(GO head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house,
You should have thought of me b4 you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I cant believe that u did this to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Girl I tried to give u everything,
Can't believe the ways u repaid me,
Girl u had it all,
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you,
Baby I've accepted it,
And I aint gone trip,
Girl im movin on,
Sometimes I cant help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me

[Chorus]

How could you let somebody lay where I layed?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, How could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you??
How could you put him up to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??",2004
Breaks My Heart,Monica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monica/breaksmyheart.html,"[Verse 1]
When I think of what I've done
All the pain that I brung
Baby you should've walked out on me
And when I turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me
And it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should've been mad at you

[Chorus]
Baby it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe
After everything you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just being your girl

[Verse 2]
Never gave you my heart
Cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt
When deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need
And I always gave you up
Whenever I thought something better comes along
And right when I come back
You're waiting for me
And you welcomed me home.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if it takes my whole life
I'll make it up to you
Cause I've been so cruel
You've given your love to me
In spite of everything
I don't deserve you
From this day forward
I'm truly yours
and it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for lovin' me

I Will,Chris de Burgh,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chrisdeburgh/iwill.html,"I'm going to an island,
Where the sun will always shine,
Where the moon is always riding on the sea;
And when I go I'll leave behind,
These chains that hold me down,
The time has come to set my spirit free,
Ah ah ... I will

And there beside a mountain stream,
I'll build a house of stone,
And work the wood of cedar, pine and fir,
And then I'll make a garden,
And I'll plant a field of corn,
Press my hands deep into Mother Earth,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Yes I will,
Oh I will,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
I want to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will...  And then I'll teach my children love,
Like every father should,
For we are part of every living thing,
And speak of half-forgotten words,
Like peace and joy and good,
For the world can only live when love can sing,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Oh, yes I will,
I will,
And they will be a part of Nature once again,
Oh they will feel a part of Nature once again,
The time is now,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will, ah ah, someday I will, (someday I will)",1977

Tom Drunk,Ky-Mani Marley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kymanimarley/tomdrunk.html,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Let me tell you of a story
'Bout a creature I once knew
Had a wife that was a teacher
And the daughter was it too

He was loved among his neighbors
For the wonders works he's done
For the building of the new church
And the work for rodness funds

But things change and times got rough
And his wife is acting strange
And the friends Tom once knew so well
Just don't seems the same

Now Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Now instead of getting better
Things started to get worse
When they dropped off from the ministry
And burnt down Tom's new church

After all the things that Tom had done
It seems like no one care
Now Tom is sitting all alone
Shedding lonely tears

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Oh, oh, no, yeah
Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

To much stress, can't bare the pressure
So he sips the Devil's water
Reach at home, he rapes his wife
Then he turns and beats his daughter

Can't believe [?]
Then he slowly caught the hammer
Put the fist into his hand
Then he bowed and said the prayer

Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone, Tom is gone
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone Tom is gone

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
Played a fool
Tom is drunk now

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
He lost his crew now

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

And played the fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue, yeah, yeah",2000
Do You Believe In Loneliness,Marc Anthony,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marcanthony/doyoubelieveinloneliness.html,"I used to try
To set aside
Some Time for being lonely

So many times 
I prayed to find
Someone like you to hold me

All I know is that when I think of you
I'm not alone
I just simply close me eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

[Chrous:]
Do you believe in loneliness
I do now that's where I found you and I'll never let you go
When all I knew was onlyness
There you were
With you around
Who's lonely now

I feared the night
But now it's mine
'Cause something's out there for me

Let's take our time
I'm satisfied
With having you to own me

All I know is that when I think of you I'm not alone
I just simply close my eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
'Cause I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe

The truth is I got lost without you

Only half a blue sky

Hallelujah,Kate Voegele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katevoegele/hallelujah.html,"Well I've heard there was a sacred chord
David played and pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Oh baby I have been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah",2008
The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind),Dru Hill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/druhill/thelovewehadstaysonmymind.html,"[Spoken:]
I just can't believe it, girl 
I can't believe that it's over 
But I'm your man, and I'll be alright 
But still, the love we had 
Stays on my mind 

Lately baby, I've been thinking 
How good it was when you were here 
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking 
For once I feel my head is clear 

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes 
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise 
I guess you meant more to me than I realized 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 

And lately girl, I've been remembering 
The good times that we used to share 
My thoughts of you don't have an ending 
And memories of you are everywhere 

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern 
You win some, you lose some 
Well I've lost and I've learned 
Sisqo's so lonely 
With no place to turn 
And here at the end, I find 
Yes I do 

The love we had stays on my mind 
Girl, if you were nearer 
If you had a mirror 
Maybe you could count my tears 

And if you were nearer 
It would all be clearer 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish, how I wish 
How I wish that you were here 

And baby girl I was tired 
So I laid down to dream for a little while 
But lately I've been so, so uninspired 
Without the comfort of your smile 

But I'm not complaining 
Cuz that's how it goes 
There's always some heartache 
In this world I suppose 
But you can't imagine 
But nobody knows 

The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind

And I watched your favourite film,
Hey hey hey,
I missed you today,
I read those early letters
That were filled with early dreams,
Some of them materialised,
Others never seen,
We used to watch the world walking by
The truth is you're not here,
Here I am, I'm screwed up again,
No matter what, which way I turn,
How am I feeling, slowly bleeding here for you,
And spending time with hope
And I don't know why it is,
It's just the way it is
What am I to say,
What am I to do,
What am I, alone without you
What am I to say,
What am I to do,
What am I, alone without you
I made your favourite dinner,
And I wore the shirts you loved,
Hey hey hey,
Just in case you came
Friends still ask about you,
And I say that you're just fine,
And have you seen the world walking by?

I don't know why it is
And did I ever say,
That I just need your love,
And I want you back again,
I want you back again
You said that this isn't yet our time,
So give me time,
To get you back again

What am I to do,
What am I, alone without you

Looks like your car
Every movie I see

In the dark of night

You're all I see

You're far away
But here in my heart
Nothing has changed
I'm still holding you
Like I used to
On a busy street
In a crowded room
Wherever I go
It's just me and you
Together again
Boy it never ends

When I close my eyes
You're all I see

Dark Turn of Mind,Gillian Welch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gillianwelch/darkturnofmind.html,"Take me and love me if you want me
Don't ever treat me unkind
'Cause I had that trouble already
And it left me with a dark turn of mind

Now I see the bones in the river
And I feel the wind through the pine
And I hear the shadows a-calling
To a girl with a dark turn of mind

But oh ain't the nighttime so lovely to see?
Don't all the nightbirds sing sweetly?
You'll never know how happy I'll be
When the sun's going down

And leave me if I'm feeling too lonely
Full as the fruit on the vine
You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some have a dark turn of mind

You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some girls are blessed with a dark turn of mind",2011
Suddenly,Ashley Tisdale,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ashleytisdale/suddenly.html,"Suddenly I, am in front of the lights
Everything, I'm feeling
Scary and beautiful at the same time
And every day I try just to breathe 
I want to show the whole world
The truth inside of me

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye

My dreams begin to rain
Suddenly time, feels like the wind
It changes everywhere I go 
I'm just trying to fit in
Now here I stand
And I'm still just that girl
I'm following my heart
In this amazing crazy world

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye
Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In a blink of an eye it's happening now

As my dreams begin to rain
I want to say to love me for me
What's inside
I'm gonna be positive, not run away, so much for you 
This is my life

Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In the blink of an eye 
My dreams begin to reign",2007

Hey babe it's me, I just wanted to call to tell you that
I love you so so so so much,
Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess,
You are worthy of all of the love in the world,

I said I loved you back,

The tacks left on the map,

Let heaven in.
Somewhere in forever

Before we blew it up.
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever [x3]

Yeah we had'em rollin' in the aisles
We got it right once, didn't we
We had our shot and missed it by a mile
Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then
Do you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away

To lead you on like itâs all alright

Can they take your place
No they can't fill your space

You know the ones you wore the day
That you were taken away from me

And I finally stop playin' our song
Whe I realizied I was dancin' alone and
Finally God gave me strength
To go on and breath again

Hello Alone,Anberlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anberlin/helloalone.html,"Is this where the interstate ends?
In coastal towns like this
Waiting for my world to cave under

In the places left unknown
If hope could only find me out

Is this the end of everything we've known? (We've known)
This is the end of everything I am

Hello! Hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there?
Alone! Alone!
Cause the coldest winters thrive

Depression is the unholy ghost
In the coastal towns of ahead
Though I know a thousand names
I see my only friend
I've got the gun
All I need is ten cents for the bullet
I feel helpless, sleeping at best, waiting for your return
Are you ever coming home?

Is anybody out there?
Hello! Hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there?
Alone! Alone!
Cause the coldest winters thrive on broken homes

The tears of an angel

Stop every clock
Stars are in shock
The river will run to the sea

I won't say goodbye
I won't let you slip away from me

Can you hear heaven cry

Angel On My Shoulder,Gareth Gates,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garethgates/angelonmyshoulder.html,"My life was flashing before my eyes
A second later, I walked and realized
My heart had crashed and burned in shame
You pulled me from the flames
I took your hand and you helped me upon my feet
I confessed but you had forgiven me
There's courage in the truth you said
Our love will never end
You shield me from danger, you're my shelter 
You are my hiding place

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a Guardian Angel
Sent for me

My dream comes between us every now and then
I make mistakes, get in trouble, time and again
I ain't proud of who I am
When I'm down you understand
Blinded you can always seem to show the way 
You're the light You're the reason I'm here today
If you cry, I cry, So dry your eyes

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a Guardian Angel
Sent for me",2007

Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Wah, wah wah-wah wah
Wah-wah wah-wah, wah wah-wah

Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do

It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and
It's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go

To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
(Yeah oh no no no)

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Even though it hurts I gotta be strong

The nights that you were working late 
All alone I'd lay awake in our bed 
Someone else was puttin' food on your plate 

I refuse to believe 
that you never ever loved me 
I've gotta move on, 
our love is gone 

And this house is not a home

For all the hardest roads we have to walk alone

The wind that blows from here to California
Never stops to turn and wonder why it goes
And you don't have to tell me when you're leaving
For all the plans I've never understood
I know, I know

Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know

To have your things and wait there for a plane ride
No one there to sit and hold your hand in flight
But everyone I know out here is lonely
Even those that have someone to lie beside at night

Leave me with the dawn
It's almost gone
I know, I know
Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know",2004

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

Now the time has come now
And we must figure out
Driving north or going south
Growing up or falling down

And as we pull ourselves together
We can't help, but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

And the time has come now
And we must figure out
Driving north or going south
Growing up or falling down",2008
Goodbye Kiss,Kasabian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/goodbyekiss.html,"Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again",2011
Where Did You Go?,MxPx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mxpx/wheredidyougo.html,"I dream that someday I will find you
The blue skies turn to rain
And they're never coming back again
I've got your picture in my mind here
You're the one that got away
I was begging you to stay with me

Where did you go I just don't know?
My life is scattered in the wind
I'm trying to begin again
Where did you go I just don't know?
I don't wanna cry myself to sleep again
I don't wanna wake up all alone again

I've never been dealt a hand like this
With face cards running dry
And rain falling from the sky
What could have been if you had stayed
Broken dreams would mend
You'd be sitting in the summer wind with me

But all I've got are memories
And dreams of how my life could be
Dreams of how my life could be.",2006
All I Want Is You,Julie Roberts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julieroberts/alliwantisyou.html,"What I need is medication
In the form of a vacation
What I need is skies of blue

What I need is a perspective
One that's healthy but objective
What I need is a point of view
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

What I need is bread and water
And a father for our daughter
What I need is someone new
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you
(Only you)

[Instrumental Interlude]

What I need is loss of memory
To forget when you were with me
What I need is to admit we're through

What I want, what I need
Oh, what I want is you (only you)
What I want is you

(Only you)

All I want
Is you",2006
Shouldn't Come Back,Demi Lovato,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/demilovato/shouldntcomeback.html,"See you calling again
I don't wanna pick up, no, oh

Probably thinking too much, oh, oh

Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at

[Joe]
Every word I cut you down is playing in my head
Like a scar face crime scene ain't no bringing it back
Those tears didn't mean much to bun now I know
That you said you didn't feel it to the wind starts to get cold

[Chorus:]
Only she's the woman like the car I replaced it
No sleep I wonder if she saw this bullet coming like this
Only words that I can hear in my ear is the gesture your gon' the seeds
You planted in the fields
Baby where you at when you sitting on my pillow case no more
Baby where you at I just recognized I'm living life alone
Baby where you at I just wish just wish you'd call me
Damn this phone baby where you at
Doc said I only got four weeks my whole life just flashed before me

[Joe]
Oh, oh, ohhhaaa (how foolish could I be)
Wild as can be
Never (never) fear be humble (humble)
Got me out to face my fate
May never have a choice to be honest (honest) with the one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of taken you off that stage

[Chorus]

[Papoose]
Yea Papoose, Pap, Papoose
They say you never know what you have till you lose it
You promise your girl something you better do it
You can't tell a woman you love her are you stupid
Words don't express you love you got to prove it
Back then our relationship wasn't the truest
Grown man slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on I become foolish
Now your gone everything ruined
But girl this is Papoose I'm on your favorite track
I know your friends are in your ear
But baby come back and I never let you down so later for that
I told you I was gonna make it I was the savior of rap
And I work hard you don't got to cater to Pap
I tie my own do-rag
Lay back and relax
You don't even got to accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it acknowledge me

[Joe]
Awhooo babe
If anyone up in here wasn't just like me
Awhooo babe
Treat her like this wasn't last week
Wont you call babe (wont you call)
No this song babe
Girl you know this song is hearing me
Damn I regret when I almost pass me

If I Were You,Tamia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tamia/ifiwereyou.html,"I look in the mirror, with you in my arms
And I see a reflection
Of a smile that says you believe in love
And just for a moment, I drifted away
But I couldn't stay cuz
A hint of love, a bit of fear
I'm tryin' to say

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
Ooh yeah

I'm tryin' to protect you
From the lies that your heart tells
Even though it says that you love me
All I see is pain and misery
Seasons may change
But I can't forget the days of old
My heart ached when you walked away
I said I'd never love again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here

The days go by
And I feel that you could make me happy
Time goes on
And I feel that love is at my door
And though I tell myself that you're the one
Who said those words before
Thought it hurts too much
I can't trust in love
Again
Again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart

And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
My heart has given up
Can't be here

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
Cuz my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here

My Road,Jorn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jorn/myroad.html,"Empty was the cradle before I learned to walk
I crawled to find out where the song played
The music and the melody were captured by the heart
And so my road to light and darkness had begun

The dream inside the vision fueled within my mind
Has guided me to some where in between
Wandering the twilight in a circle of fire
Sent here to burn in this wheel of yearning
As I'm turning

The promised land is hidden beyond this life and time
But somewhere in the distance hides the sun
Brave into a new world we stumble to the fall
Into after all
I can feel death call",2012

Sad it has to be like that
It ain't working out baby in another life or space

And it's really weighing heavy on me baby
Both of us acting crazy

Middle of the night
Always seems to remind me 
Love, how much it hurts
To know it's getting worse
My faith in us is slowly dying

Make You Feel My Love,Ronan Keating,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ronankeating/makeyoufeelmylove.html,"When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love",2009
Gave It All Away,Boyzone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boyzone/gaveitallaway.html,"I ... I will learn to live before I die
Will learn to love and learn to try
Not to give it all away (give it all away)
She ... she may be
The one that's meant for me
Or for the man that I used to be (used to be)
Til' I gave it all away (gave it all away [x2])

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

You taught me to see the better truth
About yourself but about me too (about me too)
I was stupid over you
What could I do

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

Some people wait a lifetime for a chance like this
I've waited enough
Baby, no, I won't let you go
I'm sick of tears and bitter fears

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor

A Waste of Space,Dayshell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dayshell/awasteofspace.html,"Today the presence's over, awake the dead for closure
Believing in true, I love you

A waste of space is cliche,
The thought of endless betraying me like a fool,
So who needs you.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

Tonight my love is unsafe,
I'm left with doubts and mistakes,
Collapsing into the bottle of you.
If I could rewind and go back,
I'd destroy the place that we first me at.
And I just might.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

You took the best of me, the best of me.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
Don't you see me now, I'm on my knees,
You say I'm invincible, but they all seen me bleed
And I know, you've done this before",2013
Angel,Jamey Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jameyjohnson/angel.html,"The voice on the telephone sounds awful angry
And somehow it doesn't fit in
With the face in the picture I keep on my dresser
Of the girl I once called my best friend

We drank from the fountain of good times and dreaming
But these lawyers have poisoned the well
And as our love is dying they're making a killing
On heartaches and furniture sales

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?

Am I right or is she right or are we both wrong?
Or is it even about that at all?
As Heaven is fading we're fighting and fussing
And the devil's just having a ball.

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?",2008
I Who Have Nothing,Joe Cocker,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joecocker/iwhohavenothing.html,"I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but, oh
I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you

He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when, darling, it's I
Who loves you

I love you
I love you
I love you",2004
Nothin' Grows In Shadows,Jake Owen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jakeowen/nothingrowsinshadows.html,"Hey you kids, bullying the kids down at your school
one of these days you're gonna grow up, be ashamed
who gave you the right to decide who is and who aint cool
who could sit at your table and be on your team and play your games

let 'em shine, shine like a diamond
give 'em time and you'll fine theres not cover rose
God's light shines for everybody
so get outta His way
nothin grows in shadows

hey fathers, screamin' at your kids from the bleachers
saying ""quit actin like a sissy, suck it up and win""
maybe you ought'a stop and think about what you're teaching
yeah you talk about a loser, I dont think it's them

let 'em shine, shine like a diamond
give 'em time and you'll fine theres not cover rose

well I aint sayin' I aint been a shadow myself
a dark cloud that rained on somebody else
well I learned a lesson that I need to tell
the doctor that saved my mommas life
helped beat her cancer, made sure she got well
was a kid I went to school with all my life
man I used to give him hell

let 'em shine, shine like a diamond
give 'em time and you'll fine theres not cover rose

Womanhood,Tammy Wynette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tammywynette/womanhood.html,"Well he said hold on Patricia
I only tried to kiss ya
She said OK and then said don't you dare
She seems so badly shakin'
He thought he was mistaken
But it sure looked like she bowed her head in prayer

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Shortly after midnight
She turned off the porch light
Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wonderin' if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman to
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood
One more time

You heard, yes I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Slowly slip into my womanhood
Slowly slip into my womanhoo-oo-oo-ood...",1978
Underneath Your Clothes,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/underneathyourclothes.html,"You're a song 
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong cause 
This might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

Because of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over 
We will still belong to each other 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey [x2]

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true 
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey [x2]",2001
Lips Of An Angel,Hinder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hinder/lipsofanangel.html,"Honey why you calling me so late?
It's kinda hard to talk right now.
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue

Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful

Speechless,The Veronicas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/veronicas/speechless.html,"Feels like I have always known you
And I swear I've dreamt about you
All those endless nights I was alone
It's like I've spent forever searching
Now I know that it was worth it
With you it feels like I am finally home

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

Cuz you leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
Can't help but surrender
My everything to you

I thought I could resist you
I thought that I was strong
Somehow you were different from what I've known
I didn't see you coming
You took me by surprise and
You stole my heart before I could say no

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

You leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender
Oh no
My everything to you

You leave me speechless
(the way you smile, the way you touch my face)
You leave me breathless
(it's something that you do I can't explain)
I'd run a million miles just to hear you say my name,
Baby

You leave me speechless
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender
My everything to you",2005
Horses in My Dreams,PJ Harvey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pjharvey/horsesinmydreams.html,"Horses in my dreams 
Like waves, like the sea 
They pull out of here 
They pull, they are free

Rode a horse around the world 
Along the tracks of a train 
Broke the record, found the gold 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear

Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea 
On the tracks of a train 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear",2000
Welcome to My Life,Simple Plan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simpleplan/welcometomylife.html,"Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you're screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like


To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life",2004

I hope you keep on walkinâ âtil you find the window
If itâs cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile

Is that this life becomes all that you want it to

I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish

I hope you never look back but you never forget
All the ones who love you
And the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find Godâs grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything, yeah more than anything

I hope you know somebody loves you

A Lonely September,Plain White T's,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/plainwhitets/alonelyseptember.html,"I'm sittin' here all by myself
Just tryin' to think of something to do
Tryin' to think of something, anything
Just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know it's not working out
'cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind

[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

I'm sittin' here tryin' to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own

[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back

I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight

I'm sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone it's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
We've got nothing left to prove

[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

And I didn't mean to meet you then
We were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
But you did",2002
Poem to a Horse,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/poemtoahorse.html,"You're to far to bring you close
And too high to see below
just hangin' on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
You start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

[Chorus:]
I'll leave again 
Cuz I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'd rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
Cuz to talk to you is harder work 
So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
Cuz there's a foot for every shoe 
I wish you luck but I've got other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've
Been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more",2001
Without A Kiss,Badly Drawn Boy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/badlydrawnboy/withoutakiss.html,"All the songs have been sung
Youâre too old and then youâre too young
Did you leave your mark on the world
One as deep as true love
Letâs sing Hosanna

All the stories are told
Youâre too young and then youâre too old
Did you leave a mark on the world
One that lasts as long as true love
Take me with you now

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
And someone you saw again
Back to haunt you there and then
Please take on my love

Evolution is real
Secrets we have never revealed
Did you leave your mark, was it real
Or as deep as the love we both feel

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
Like a gift you didnât keep
And it leaves a mark so deep

Thereâs a million things to miss
Like the chance to take that kiss
where you go, youâll be someone
With one kiss your life is swung

What you gonna do when you walk away
Walk behind me, itâs alright, Iâm Ok
Then what will you do if I walk away
Walk beside me, itâs alright, weâre Ok
Where you gonna do, donât surrender
Hold me tight, donât let go",2006

If You Were a Sailboat,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/ifyouwereasailboat.html,"If you were a cowboy I would trail you
If you were a piece of wood I'd nail you to the floor
If you were a sailboat I would sail you to the shore
If you were a river I would swim you
If you were a house I would live in you all my days
If you were a preacher I'd begin to change my ways

Sometimes I believe in fate
But the chances we create
Always seem to ring more true
You took a chance on loving me
I took a chance on loving you

If I was in jail I know you'd spring me
If I was a telephone you'd ring me all day long
If was in pain I know you'd sing me soothing songs

Sometimes I believe in fate
But the chances we create
Always seem to ring more true
You took a chance on loving me
I took a chance on loving you

If I was hungry you would feed me
If I was in darkness you would lead me to the light
If I was a book I know you'd read me every night

If you were a cowboy I would trail you
If you were a piece of wood I'd nail you to the floor
If you were a sailboat I would sail you to the shore
If you were a sailboat I would sail you to the shore",2007
Circle,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/circle.html,"There are two of us talking in circles
and one of us who wants to leave
in a world created for only us
an empty cage that has no key
don't you know we're working with flesh and blood
carving out of jealousy
Crawling into each other it's smothering
every little part of me
What kind of love is this that keeps me
hanging on
despite everything it's doing to me
what is this love that keeps me coming
back for more
when it will only end in misery
I know too many people unhappy
in a life from which they'd love to flee
watching others get everything offered
they're wanton for discovery
Oh my brother my sister my mother
you're loosing your identity
can't you see that it's you in the window
shining with intensity
What kind of love is this that keeps me
hanging on
despite everything it's doing to me
what is this love that keeps me coming
back for more
when it will only end in misery...",1993
Lost,Anouk,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anouk/lost.html,"If roses are meant to be red

Starry eyes that make me melt
Right in front of me

Lost in this world
I even get lost in this song
And when the lights go down
That is where I'll be found

This music's irresistible
Your voice makes my skin crawl
Innocent and pure
I guess you heard it all before

Mister Inaccessible
Will this ever change
One thing that remains the same
You're still a picture in a frame

Lost in this world
I even get lost in this song
And when the lights go down
That is where I'll be found

I get lost in this world
I get lost in your eyes
And when the lights go down
That's where I'll be found
Yeah yeah

Lost in this world
I get lost in your eyes
And when the lights go down
Am I the only one
Ooh",2004
Over You,Daughtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daughtry/overyou.html,"Now that it's all said and done,
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down,
Like an old abandoned house.
What you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath.
I fell too far, was in way too deep.
Guess I let you get the best of me.

Well, I never saw it coming.
I should've started running
A long, long time ago.
And I never thought I'd doubt you,
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know.
I'm slowly getting closure.
I guess it's really over.
I'm finally getting better.
And now I'm picking up the pieces.
I'm spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together.
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through,
I got over you.

You took a hammer to these walls,
Dragged the memories down the hall,
Packed your bags and walked away.
There was nothing I could say.
And when you slammed the front door shut,
A lot of others opened up,
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me.

Well, I never saw it coming.
I should've started running
A long, long time ago.
And I never thought I'd doubt you,
I'm better off without you

Broken,Seether,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/seether/broken.html,"I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh

Black Hole,Lindsay Lohan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lindsaylohan/blackhole.html,"I found that box of letters
Lying on the ground
The ones you used to write me before it all went down
I even got a papercut trying to figure out
What to do with all these memories
And you're not who you used to be
And I wonder where your gone

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love? [2x]

Those days of doing nothing fell like nothing did before
I don't need those sneakers or that money after all
I'll trade them for old message you've called

And I wonder what went wrong

Have you fallen in a black hole?

What happened to the moments where we felt so much?
Where's the love?
I wanna go there, and I wanna know where
Everything that meant something to me is all

I found that box of letters, used to make me smile
But now I feel so lonely

What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where had so much?
A black hole
Somewhere there's a univere of missing stuff

I never dreamed that I'd miss somebody like you

And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love with you
with you

What a wicked game you play, you make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, make me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, never felt that way
What a wicked thing to do, make me dream of you

And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love with you

There's A Place For Us,Phil Collins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/philcollins/theresaplaceforus.html,"'...There's a place for us, somewhere a time and a place.' 

So here we are together
just you and me
sitting side by side
don't know why
with time just racing by
but I don't want to go

Well I don't know much about it
'cos all I am is what you see
in front of you
there's no more
feels so close and yet so far
but I don't want to go

Here I am, take my hand
here I am, please take my hand

I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright
if you don't mind I could sit and stare all night
sit here waiting for you to hold me tight

It's sad but I know it's true
you see I know you well
you'd only laugh at me
and that would hurt me so
just look at me here
you've got me pleading with you
but i don't want to go

'Cos you know that I love you so
yes you know that I love you so

Here. I will be here love
for you love, I will always be here love

If you look real close
you'll see my heart is on my sleeve
and it'll be here waiting
waiting for you, waiting for me
someone once said that if you truly, truly believe
you can make things happen
make things appear to be all that they seem
tell me do you believe?

We'll find a hideaway
together we'll find a way
somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way
there must be somewhere
there must be someplace
we can find somewhere
where they don't know my face
believe me we can find it
yes we can find it
somewhere, there's a place for us
somewhere, a time and a place for us

The Suburbs,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/thesuburbs.html,"In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screamin'
We're still screamin'
We're still screamin'",2010
Love Is Blindness,Jack White,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackwhite/loveisblindness.html,"One, two, three
Two, two, three

Love is blindness,
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness.

I'm in a parked car
On a crowded street,
And I see my love
Made complete.
The thread is ripping
The knot is slipping.
Love is blindness.

Love is clockworks,
And it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Blindness

Love is blindness
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness

A little death
Without mourning
No call
No Warning
Baby, a dangerous idea...
Almost makes...sense

Love is drowning
In a deep well
All the secrets
And no body else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey
Blindness

Love is blindness,
I'm so sick of it,
I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
And wrap it all around me, now
Oh my love
Blindness

Oh, I'm too numb to feel...
Blow out the candle.

I Wish You Could See What I Have On Right Now

Imagine How Intense It Would Be
To Hold Me Right Now

At Night, When You're Far And I'm Alone
I Feel The Fabric From Your T-Shirt
Flow With My Body
I Can Still Hear Your Baritone
In My Ear Telling Me You'll Take It Slow
And I Was In The Mirror Playing A Role
Like You Were Here, I Couldn't Turn Me On
So I Fell Asleep With The Music On
Woke Up Again Hearing The Same Old Song, Playing

(Oh) Giving Me The Fever
(Oh) Now You Got My Feet Up
This One Is A Keeper
Now The Second Verse Is Playing
(Oh) We Tried To Stand Up
(Oh) Hold Me While My Hands Up
(Oh) And The Music Picks Up
Now He Sees My Shirt Off
I'm Thinking To Myself Again

When You're Not Here (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
I Wish You Were Here (To Take Off Your T-Shirt)
After We Make Love (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
Wake Up In Your T-Shirt,
To smell The Scent Of Your Cologne
When I Need Your Feel (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
I Need Help (To Take Off Your T-Shirt)
After We Make Love (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
Wake Up In Your T-Shirt,
To Smell The Scent Of Your Cologne

Hold Up A Minute, Thought I Heard Your Name

At Nine, He'll Be Arriving On A Plane
Then We'll Be Making Love And Hearing The Song Again

Little light will guide them to me.

My face is all lit up.

They'll not take me for a buoy.

Let me be weak,
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep.

Cromaty, gale east...Malin, Sellafield...""

""Come here with me now.""

Oh, I'll wake up
To any sound of engines,
Ev'ry gull a seeking craft.
I can't keep my eyes open--
Wish I had my radio.

I tune in to some friendly voices
Talking 'bout stupid things.
I can't be left to my imagination.

Let me be weak,
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep.

Ooh, their breath is warm
And they smell like sleep,
And they say they take me home.
Like poppies heavy with seed
They take me deeper and deeper.",1985

Sometime when it always seemed
To be just us and them
Girls that wore pink
And boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men
Than me and you
What's a man now - what's a man mean
Is he rough or is he rugged
Is he cultural and clean
Now it's all change - it's got to change more
'Cause we think it's getting better
But nobody's really sure
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
See the nice boys - dancing in pairs
Golden earring golden tan
Blow-wave in the hair
Sure they're all straight - straight as a line
All the gays are macho
Can't you see their leather shine
You don't want to sound dumb - don't want to offend
So don't call me a faggot
Not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall and handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
Time to get scared - time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady
Don't know how to be a man
Time to admit - what you call defeat
'Cause there's women running past you now
And you just drag your feet
Man makes a gun - man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink
And man can take a whore
Kill all the blacks - kill all the reds
And if there's war between the sexes
Then there'll be no people left
And so it goes - go round again

Not About Love,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/notaboutlove.html,"The early cars
Already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work
In holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag
And the bind
And the ammunition round

Conversation once colored by esteem
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation, my palate got clean
Now I could taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag
And the bind
And the ammunition round

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I can't stop falling out

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

What is this posture
I have to stare at
That's what he said when I'm sittin' up straight
Change the name of the game 'cause he lost
And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I've said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels
Step out of this sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I cant stop falling out

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I cant stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache",2005

(You know it's just too little too late)

It's just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything
But it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate
(You know it's just too little too late)

Go find someone else
I'm letting you go
I'm loving myself
You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give
(I have so much to give)
With a player like you I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live, no, no

It's just too little too late

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

You know it's just too little too late
I can't wait, no, no, no

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)",2006
Time and Time Again,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/timeandtimeagain.html,"Yes I did it and I'll do it again 
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
I don't think so 
You're not that smart 
Over and over it breaks my heart 
The cycle continues time for your crime 
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
Her makeup smears 
The tears that she cries 
Over and over every night 

Emotional swords slash my soul 
And now the pain takes control 
I think about you 
I think about me 
Think about the way that it used to be 
I need a bottle 
I need some pills 
I need a friend 
I need some thrills 
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
When life gets rough 

Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 

It's like a fight every single day 
It's always easy when you have it your way 
Deep in my heart 
In the depths of my soul 
My selfish ways are out of control 
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
The makeup smears 
Tears that we cry 
Over and over every night 

You're so selfish 
You're making me want to end this relationship 
You're making me want to end this 

Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind 
Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind",2002
Singular Indestructible Droid,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/singularindestructibledroid.html,"Blood of my blood 
Skin of my skin 
A normal human being 
Solder and wires 
Circuitry 
We're far from human beings 

He's sick of his skin 
It's time to trade it in 
A galaxy of emotions 
Your soul is what it costs 
We walk the same path 
No body could get in our way 
Dangerously 
We passionately never hesitate 

Keep the soul 
That's control 
Now you put in the metal 

Biological 
Spiritual 
Electrical 
Digital 
S.I.D. 

Willing to make the change 
Surrender the flesh and bones 
Against the grain 
Pushing beyond the limits of ourselves 
This body is just a cage 
You're dead and you're in a grave 
We're losing our minds 
That's just fine 
Living forever 

Bleed out my blood 
Skin off my skin 
Solder the wire 
Transformation 
Take my body and 
Release me from this cage 
You can't put a spirit in a grave

He Wasn't,Avril Lavigne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avrillavigne/hewasnt.html,"There's not much going on today.
I'm really bored, it's getting late.
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate.

Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

This is when I start to bite my nails.
And clean my room when all else fails.
I think it's time for me to bail.
This point of view is getting stale.

Sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

We've all got choices.
We've all got voices.
Stand up make some noise.
Stand up make some noise.

Sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
Like I was special, 'cause I was special.",2004
Island,Heather Nova,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heathernova/island.html,"There are parts of me he'll never know, my wild horses and my river beds, and in my throat voices he'll never hear.
He pulls at me like a cherry tree, and I can still move but I don't speak about it.
Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead. He's to scared to hit me now - he'll bring flowers istead

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere to go

And the dogwoods shimmer in October sun, ""oh sweet thing"", he sings to me,
""You're the only one.""

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you, 
Somewhere to go.

And I don't know why I can't tell my sister, He spat in my face again, and I don't want to die here. You know that dream when your feet won't move, you want to come but your body won't let you. He steals it from me.He steals it from me. It shines like sweat, like jewels, like something that has died to soon. He fucks with the beauty. A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick, a kiss kiss kick. He steals it from me. It's out of my hands again.

Strong Enough,Stacie Orrico,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stacieorrico/strongenough.html,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there anyway to be made whole again?
If I'm healed,renewed, and find forgiveness find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and it turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I've finally found

That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh Thank You for my chance to start again",2003

I don't wanna talk I just wanna go back to blue 
Feed's me when I'm hungry and quenches my thirst 
Loves me when I'm lonely and thinks of me first 
Blue is the color of night 
When the red sun 
Disappears from the sky 
Raven feathers shiny and black 
A touch of blue glistening down her back 
We don't talk about heaven and we don't talk about hell
We come to depend on one another so damn well
So go to confession whatever gets you through
You can count your blessings I'll just count on blue

When the red sun 
Disappears from the sky 
Raven feathers shiny and black 
A touch of blue glistening down her back

Ends,Everlast,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everlast/ends.html,"Everything must change...
Ends...

[Chorus:]
Some people would rob their mother for the ends
Rat snitch on one another for the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered for the ends
So before we go any further I want my ends

I knew this cat named Dale
Who didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material
Ivy League scholar
Had a PHD
An MBA
But now he's waitin' tables 'cause there's rent to pay
Company's down sizin'
Inflation's risin'
Can't find a job
He's feelin' kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he's been blessed
So he falls off track
Starts smokin' the crack
And once it hits his brain
It starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back
The shoes off his feet
He's losin' all his teeth
Now he's out on the street
And all of the sudden he's like Jesse James
Tryin' to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school
And he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew this chick named Sally
She had a nice strut
And everywhere that I went she was up in the cut
Swingin' that butt like ""place your ad here""
Only rapped the Benz
And rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearin'Champagne wavin'
Jewels around the neck
A lotta style she's cravin'
Ain't no savin'
She's doin' all the spendin'
If you do the lendin'
She'll do the bendin'
Straight machine vendin'
That's money for tail
Shoppin' sprees get her on her knees
And then you hit her with the keys of your krib you actin' funny
Come home one day find her countin' out your money
From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo
If you broke she's spittin'
If you're rich she might swallow
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew these two homeboys
That made a lot of noise
Makin' money on the block
The kids was on their jock
They was tougher than leather
Like Reverend Run
DMC they was totin' guns
Holdin' weight
Goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips
And pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and clothes
And got no job
And then one disappeared
And one got robbed
For the ends

[Chorus x2]",1998
The World You Love,Jimmy Eat World,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmyeatworld/theworldyoulove.html,"I got a story it's almost finished
all i need is someone to tell it too
maybe, that's you.

our time is borrowed and spent to freely
every minute i have needs to be made up
but how?
i'm looking for a nice way to say
""i'm out.""
i want out.

i fall asleep with my friends around me
only place i know, i feel safe
i'm gonna call this home

the open road is still miles away
Hey nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

Windows open and close
that's just how it goes

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

i'm in love with the ordinary
i need a simple space
and rest my head
everything gets clear
well i'm a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps 
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it (over it)

it might seem like a dream
but it's real to me

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesn't seem theres hope for me
i let you down
but i won't give in now
not for any amount

Less Is More,Joss Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jossstone/lessismore.html,"Don't go sending me those three dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do
Don't go trying to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm making money too

Don't go throwing those stones outside my window
You don't gotta be calling three times a day
'Cause if you do then when we get together
I'll be biting my lip 'cause there's nothing else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]
Less is more
Back it up slow it down let it breathe
Cause you too much of a good thing can be
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember

If you wanna be showing your affection
Don't you know a simple kiss will do
So many beautiful ways for love's expression
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't getting through

Haven't you heard a little space makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]

It would be something if I had a chance to be missing you
Too much for taking it's driving me crazy
That's all you do
It needs rearranging
It's so suffocating
That I can't move
You gotta take two steps back
Believe what they say
It's true

[Chorus]

Gimme a chance to miss you
Boy I don't mean to diss you, but 
I tell you I need some space and still you call me up three times a day
You know, baby you crowding me out
Haven't you heard less is more

Less is more",2004
Name,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/name.html,"And even though the moment passed me by 
I still can't turn away 
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
Got tossed along the way 
And letters that you never meant to send 
Got lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans 
And never knew their names 
We don't belong to no one 
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me 
Maybe for a while 
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far 
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast 
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history 
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name 
I won't tell em' your name 
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I won't tell em' your name
Ow!

And I won't tell 'em your name",1995
The Perfect Ending,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/theperfectending.html,"Taken in context,
It's not a bad thing,
But when you start to pick it apart,
It gets so depressed,
It's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity,

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,
There are no perfect endings,

You peel back the layers
And get down to the inside,
But sometimes you loose sight,
Of what it was you were trying to find,
And it's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,

It'll be the last,

I just have a chance,
Not a family or honest plea remains to say,

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Is it you I want or just the notion
Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around?

Safe to say from here,
You're getting closer now,
We are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

To lie here under you,
Is all that I could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
To lie here under you is all that i could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,

All the world is waiting for the sun.",2004

And create a mood I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

Something I Never Had,Lindsay Lohan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lindsaylohan/somethingineverhad.html,"Do you see me
Do you feel me like I feel you
Call your number
I can not get through
You don't hear me and I dont understand
When I reach out I dont find your hand

Were they wasted words and did they mean a thing
And all our precious time but I still feel so in between

[Chorus:]
Some day I just keep pretending
That you'll stay dreaming of a diffrent ending
I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had

I keep telling myself things can turn around with time
And if I wait it out you could always change your mind
Like a fairy tale where it works out in the end
Can I close my eyes have you lying here again
Then I come back down
Then I fade back in
Then I realize its just what might have been.

[chorus]

Am I a shadow on your wall
Am I anything at all
Anything to you
Am I a secret that you keep
Do you dream me while your sleeping after all
Some day I just keep pretending
That you'll stay dreaming of a diffrent ending
I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had
That I never had
I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had
You dont see me, you dont feel me like I feel you",2004
Summer Sunshine,The Corrs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/corrs/summersunshine.html,"Everyone's changing, I stay the same 
I'm... a solo cello outside a chor-us 
I've got a secret, 
It's time for me to tell that you've been keeping me warm 

Just sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings 
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back, I've never felt so wanted 
Are you taking me home? 

You tell me you have to go... 

[Chorus:]
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know 

Now that you've left me, there's no retur-ning 
I keep comparing, you're always win-ning 
I try to be strong but you'll never be more wanted 
Will you make me at home? 

Don't tell me you have to go...

I miss you like nobody else

I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back 
Winter is coming and I need to stay warm 

The heat.....

I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody knows

Everything I'm Not,The Veronicas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/veronicas/everythingimnot.html,"Oh no
Don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you where something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
Cause your so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah all by yourself
You're all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute
Because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey don't u get it
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else

I don't wanna pretend

Long Way To Happy,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/longwaytohappy.html,"One night to you
Lasted six weeks for me
Just a bitter little pill now
Just to try to go to sleep
No more waking up to innocence
Say hello to hesitance
To everyone I meet
Thanks to you years ago
I guess I'll never know
What love means to me but oh
I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to
Keep on rolling like a stone
Cause it's gonna be a long long way to happy

Left my childhood behind
In a roll away bed
Everything was so damn simple
Now I'm losing my head
Trying to cover up the damage
And pad out all the bruises
too young to know i had it
So it didn't hurt to lose it
Didn't hurt to lose it
No but oh
I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to
Keep on rolling like a stone
Cause it's gonna be a long long way

Now I'm numb as hell and I can't feel a thing
But don't worry about regret or guilt cause I never knew your name
I just want to thank you
Thank you
From the bottom of my heart
For all the sleepless nights
And for tearing me apart yeah yeah

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to

I Don't Want to Care,Jessica Simpson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jessicasimpson/idontwanttocare.html,"Here's another day 
Another girl left so confused 
Trying to find a way 
In the common likes of you 
But you're so undecided 
Stringing me along 
And it hurts just thinking 'bout one day your here and then your gone 

Nothing to say 
Wont hesitate 
Can't walk away from you 
You weren't there 
When I was scared 
Now all I wanna do is forget about love 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care anymore 

Trying to brace myself 
For the fall coz you didn't catch me 
Promised that you would hold me tight, be the one I need 

But I stood waiting for you to come give me a ride 
Back to what love's supposed to be; I guess that was a lie 

You and I now 
I don't how 
I could have fallen so deep 
Coz you weren't here to wipe all my tears 
Erase it from my memories 
I don't want to care 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now i care way too much 
Now this love thing i wish i never felt it before 
I dont wanna care 

Oh my precious time; now I can't get it back 
So lost and alone 
And I can't take feelin' like that 

Baby I've had enough 
I just wanna move on 
Don't wanna look back 
Coz I know I gotta be strong 

I don't wanna care about love anymore 
I don't wanna care about us 
I don't want to care about love: 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore

Lime Tree,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/limetree.html,"I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message said it's done,
It's done

When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Just come inside

But I keep going out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m. my heart is beating too loud
Too loud
Don't be so amazing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched

Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
If you don't

It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune

So I just won't be late
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took",2007
A Sight for Sore Eyes,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/asightforsoreeyes.html,"hey sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see
workin hard hardly workin hey man you know me

that we toast to the old days and dimagio too
and old drysdale and mantle whitey ford and to you

'cept for thumm and giardina said they just might be down
oh half drunk all the time and i'm all drunk the rest
yea monk's till the champion but i'm the best

i guess you heard about nash he was killed in a crash
hell that must of been two or three years ago now
yea he spun out and he rolled he hit a telephone pole
and he died with the radio on
no she's married and with a kid finally split up with sid
he's up north for a nickle's worth for armed robbery

hey i'll play you some pin ball hell you ain't got a chance
well then go on over and ask her to dance",1977
Shake It Off,Mariah Carey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariahcarey/shakeitoff.html,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial life
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

And go somewhere

Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore,LeAnn Rimes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leannrimes/tillweaintstrangersanymore.html,"It might be hard to be lovers
But its harder to be friends
Baby pull down the covers
Its time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
Ill just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Dont you think its time we say
Some things we havent said
It aint too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why dont you look at me
Til we aint strangers anymore

Sometimes its hard to love me
Sometimes its hard to love you too
I know its hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life

With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

[Solo]

Its hard to find forgivness
When we just run out of lies
Its hard to say youre sorry
When you cant tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So lets get down to it baby
There aint no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers
We're not strangers anymore",2007
All Cried Out,Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lisalisacultjam/allcriedout.html,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh you, all over you, ooh

Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener (why oh why)
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong? (Leavin' me all alone)

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I, I don't what to do
I'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)
(Whoa, whoa...)

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you
(I left you so confused, now I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out
Over you",1985

Forever,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/forever.html,"In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds by his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her... He'll never forgive her

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl... little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroine
In this moment I'm lonely fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs all these women
I'm never forgiven... this broken heart of mine

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss",2006
Never Think,Robert Pattinson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertpattinson/neverthink.html,"I should never think 
What's in your heart 
What's in our home 
So I won't

You'll learn to hate me 
But still call me baby 
Oh, love 
So call me by my name 

And save your soul 
Save your soul 
Before you're too far gone 
Before nothing can be done 

I'll try to decide when 
She'll lie in the end 
I ain't got no fight in me 
In this whole damn world 
Tell you to hold off 
You choose to hold on 
It's the one thing that I've known 

Once I put my coat on 
I'm coming out in this all wrong 
She's standing outside holding me 
Saying, 'Oh, please 
I'm in love 
I'm in love'

Girl save your soul 
Go on save your soul 
Before you're too far gone 
Before nothing can be done 

'Cause without me 
You got it all 
So hold on 
Without me you got it all 
So hold on 
Without me you got it all 
Without me you got it all 
So hold on 
Without me you got it all 
So hold on 
Without me you got it all 
So hold on",
The Ballad,Millencolin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/millencolin/theballad.html,"The last selection in the ballgame.
Does never get a pass.
""Not appreciated's"" just his first name.
He's the scapegoat of the class.
There are no friends to cheer him up and
no girls, no sweet romance.
It's impossible to expand,
when you never get a second chance.

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?  He's in pain and misery.

He's not going to the school-prom.
He said he had the flu.
Jumped-up excuses as he told mom.
-I'm safer here with you.
She told her son.  -Someday, they'll all be
sorry for mistreating you.
Don't be afraid my son and trust me.
-You'll be someone they will look up to.

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?
He's in pain and misery... Do you care enough to see?

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?  He's in pain and misery.",2000
Have You Ever,Brandy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brandy/haveyouever.html,"Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything up to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
'Cuz baby I can't sleep

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever",1998
The Little Things,Colbie Caillat,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/colbiecaillat/thelittlethings.html,"[V1:]
The little things, you do to me are
Taking me over, I wanna show ya
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that, is crazy beating
My feet are stuck here, against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

[Chorus:]
(back up, back up) take another chance,
Don't you (mess up, mess up) I don't wanna lose you
(wake up, wake up) this ain't just a thing that you
(give up, give up) don't you say that I'd be
Better off better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off better off, with out you boy

[V2:]
And every time, you notice me by
Holding me closely, and saying sweet things
I don't believe, that it could be
You speaking your mind and, saying the real thing
My feet have broke free, and I am leaving
I'm not gonna stand here, feeling lonely but
I don't regret it, and I won't think this
Was just a waste of time

[Chorus]

Don't just leave, me, hanging on [repeat]

[Verse 1]

Don't just leave me hanging on

Don't you (mess up, mess up) I don't wanna lose you
(wake up, wake up) this ain't just a thing that you
(give up, give up) don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off sitting by myself & wondering (don't just leave me hanging on)
If I'm better off, better off without you boy (don't just leave me hanging on)

Don't just leave me hanging on [repeat 'til end]",2007
Possibility,Lykke Li,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lykkeli/possibility.html,"There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All that I had, was all I'm gonn' get.

mmmmmmm......

There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare.
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare.

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows.
Tell me when you hear my silence.
There's a possibility I wouldn't know

mmmmmmm....
mmmmmmm....

Know that when you leave,
Know that when you leave,
by blood and by me, you walk like a thief,
by blood and by me, I fall when you leave.

So tell me when you hear my heart stop.
You're the only one who knows.
Tell me when you hear my silence,
There's a possibility I wouldn't know.

So tell me when my sorrows over
You're the reason why I'm closed
Tell me when you hear me falling.
There's a possibility it wouldn't show.

mmmmmm.....
mmmmmm.....

By blood and by me, I'll fall when you leave.
By blood and by me, I'll follow your lead.

The Real Life,3 Doors Down,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/3doorsdown/thereallife.html,"I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and left those fears inside
And I wanted to be anyone else
Only to find that there was noone there but me

But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me

I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could of screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say

But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me

Thats out there somewhere
And it cant be that far away
Thats where ill find myself
And ill find my way out
Thats where ill find out

Judas,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/judas.html,"The only one who took you in
The only one who held your hand
Defended you against the others
Had your back on everything
Never let you down
You turned around betrayed your only brother

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

I didn't know, I didn't know
I couldn't see, I couldn't see
Never thought you'd forget me
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe
How you deceived, you deceived
I never thought you'd do that to me

I will never be like you
I'll never do the things you do
Selfish and lonely, what's your problem
Letting go of you and this
Is harder than I thought but I will not be poisoned by your actions

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

I didn't know, I didn't know

Haunted,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/haunted.html,"Louder, louder
The voices in my head
Whispers taunting
All the things you said
Faster the days go by and I'm still
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
Time
In the blink of an eye
You held my hand, you held me tight
Now you're gone
And I'm still crying
Shocked, broken
I'm dying inside

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Shadows linger
Only to my eye
I see you, I feel you
Don't leave my side
It's not fair
Just when I found my world
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart

I miss you, you hurt me
You left with a smile
Mistaken, your sadness
Was hiding inside
Now all that's left
Are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept
The soul behind a guise

Where are you
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Why did you go?
All these questions run through my mind
I wish I couldn't feel at all
Let me be numb
I'm starting to fall

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Where are you?

There For You,Flyleaf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/flyleaf/thereforyou.html,"Sometimes I'm a selfish fake
You're always a true friend
And I don't deserve you
'Cause I'm not there for you
Please forgive me again

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

Swirling shades of blue
Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry, cry

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

'Cause I hear the whispered words
In your masterpiece beautiful
You speak the unspeakable thought
I love you too

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
I wanna be there for you,

And be
Someone you can come to

It runs deeper than my bones
The love

I wanna be there for you.",2005
Unbreakable,Fireflight,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fireflight/unbreakable.html,"Where are the people that accused me?
The ones who beat me down and bruised me
They hide just out of sight
Can't face me in the light
They'll return but I'll be stronger

God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

Sometimes it's hard to just keep going
But faith is moving without knowing
Can I trust what I can't see?
To reach my destiny
I want to take control but I know better

[Chorus]

Forget the fear it's just a crutch
That tries to hold you back
And turn your dreams to dust
All you need to do is just trust

Geek Love,Nerina Pallot,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nerinapallot/geeklove.html,"In the race to get out of this place,
I am checking my face in the back of a spoon,
You're accusing, you say I'm not here, but I'm here, yes I'm here, yes,
I'm not on the moon, 
But I'm leaving so soon,
So don't presume to know shit about me,
'Cause I don't know myself from one day to the next,
And I don't pose perplexities purposely,
This isn't a game, this isn't a test.

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

Nine am to the beat of a drum,
As we drive through the canyon,
I'm feeling the hum of the engine,
My head and my heart are a-swim-will your cat be ok?
Your wife was she in?
Your wife, is she in???
'Cause I don't presume to know shit about you,
When you won't really tell me until I beg you to,
But I know that perplexity's a wonderful thing,
It's a sudden found joy, the strangeness it brings...

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

I like that we argue,
But not everyday,
Your scent in a room,
The way that you say 'color' not 'colour'.

What colour today?
It's grey, grey, it's grey.

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.",2005

Had Enough,Breaking Benjamin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/breakingbenjamin/hadenough.html,"Milk it for all it's worth.
Make sure you get there first.
The apple of your eye.
The rotten core inside.

You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.

You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.

Pull me out (I will break it in)
Hold me down (better in the end)
Hold me down.

Will I Ever Make It Home,Ingram Hill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ingramhill/willievermakeithome.html,"I woke up from my sleep to the sound of that voice
From the words that I heard I had no choice
They told me I had to turn around
My assurance slowly faded down
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind

The plans that I had were quickly destroyed
The problem was one I couldn't avoid
They welcomed me to stay overnight
I'm too tired to complain so i just might
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
To the place I recognize
Far from here and where I've been
And all the places that I've been shown
Will I ever make it home
Can they keep me here for good
Where I hardly know a soul
And my fear keeps going on

My weariness keeps growing inside
My patience is starting to subside
And I hope I'll be there soon
It can't be long or I'll fall through

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind
Till there is no turning back
Will I ever make it home 
Get to where I wanna be
Find the ones who wait for me
To the place where I belong
Will I ever make it home",P:

His soul flew right up in the sky and I cried myself to sleep.

My mother lies alone on her back at night.
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep.

When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep.

The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise.
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping.

You move awfully quiet now

When you were cuttin up
You were cuttin up

Two People Fell In Love,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/twopeoplefellinlove.html,"A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
'Fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up fillin' their paper plates
They've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[1st Chorus]
There ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

Well, I recall a young man who was driftin' aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafÃ°Â³ right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lotta help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[2nd Chorus]
Baby, there ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
I'm glad your dad could not resist
Your mama's charms and you exist
All because two people fell in love

[Tag]
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon",2001
I Don't Need a Man,The Pussycat Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pussycatdolls/idontneedaman.html,"I see you looking at me
Like I got something that's for you
And the way that you stare
Don't you dare
'Cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you
I don't ever want to leave you confused

The more you try
The less I buy it
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete
So let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around
Oh!

You know I got my own life
And I bought everything that's in it
So if you want to be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal
And baby I don't need a hand
If it only wants to grab one thing

The more you try
The less I buy it
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feeling you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger

So let me break it down

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

I don't need a
I don't need a man, I don't

I'll get me through

I feel brand new

Down,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/down.html,"The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad

Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so
Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so

Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.

Lullaby,David Gray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidgray/lullaby.html,"Its a sad old world
That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning 
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window 
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

All these useless emotions 
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken 
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
Cos I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead

Hear the bells",1994

That if I prayed
That I would be on my way someday

The rain has washed away
All the thoughts I've need to say
I needed to say
I needed to say

It's times like these
I don't know where I'll be
All I know are all the lonely souls
That come to me in my dreams
All the threads and seams
That were weaved in between my sleep
We're all alone now
We're all alone now
We're all alone now
We're all alone now",2011

[English translation:]

How can I say this
Without hurting you
I wanted to let you go
With right and pretty excuse and leave you

Until you hold onto me
Standing and crying

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love
With someone else

You did not want anything
You always gave everything to me
You are happy to see me happy
You always looked upon me

But your love becomes tiring more and more
I will not make excuse, I will tell you all

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
Someone else

I sometimes worry
But I forget all about you
I am truly in love

At the end of beautiful love
I didn't want to tell you all
Because you will be hurt
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love with
Someone else",P:  
Shelter,The xx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xx/shelter.html,"I find shelter, in this way
Under cover, hide away
Can you hear, when I say?
I have never felt this way

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Could I be, was I there?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown, whenever you leave
Please teach me gently, how to breathe

And I'll cross oceans, like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll mirror images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on",2009
Re: Stacks,Bon Iver,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boniver/restacks.html,"This my excavation and today is Qumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun and the moon
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down
In a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He is dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me",2008

Slowly walk away
To breathe again

Carry me away
I need your strength

Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again

And the day keeps running faster,
Into the arms of night...
The stitches on the tapestry say,
""Everything in time,
Will find it's way home again,""
But I'm tired of crying...
No Second Chances
Don't knock on my door
There won't be any answer
I won't be here no more...
This house we had together
Might still be in its place
But the rest of this is much too hard to face,
There'll be No Second Chance...
Lovely moonlit hours we spent
Walking on the beach,
We'd gaze up at the stars,
I swear they were in our reach...
But time... it went on,
Minutes... they ran too fast.
Like you they were gone...
Into the past....",1997
Hurricane,30 Seconds to Mars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/30secondstomars/hurricane.html,"No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took, you still couldn't breathe

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

As days go by, the night's on fire

Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives that I live, I will never regret

The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug (Never gonna hit the air)
The secrets that we sold were never known (Never sing the song the same)
The love we had, the love we had, we had to let it go.

Sleep if you can. But watch your father's hand

We do not want you. Nobody loves you
Father of the dark. Tonight will greet you

God in heaven, can you hear me
Help me, oh, Lord. They're coming for me
Mother warned me. Father scorned me
Oh my God. No. Now I hear him

I claim your life on this night
Within sight of your own God

The silence, the waiting then the pain

Your life has only ever been shame
And so, young boy, my hand brings doom

Child, please come awake. Please, my tiny son",2001

Picking up the ticket shows, there's money to be made
Go on and lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil
Angeles?

Don't start me trying now
'Cause I'm all over it

I could make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you

No one's gonna fool around with us

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing 'twould make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Di di di di, di di di di
Di di di di, di di di di
Di di di

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind

For standin' in your heart
Is where I want to be and long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind",1965
Mother,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/mother.html,"Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, aah, mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh, aah, mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up 'til you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

You'll always be a baby to me

Summertime Sadness,Lana Del Rey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lanadelrey/summertimesadness.html,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness

S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

Hunter,Dido,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/hunter.html,"With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go

The unread book and painful look
the tv's on, the sound is down
One long pause
then you begin
oh look what the cat's brought in
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go
let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
and I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow

I want to be a hunter again
want to see the world alone again

Gloomy Sunday,Billie Holiday,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieholiday/gloomysunday.html,"Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad
I know, let them not weep
Let them know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you

Innocent Bones,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/innocentbones.html,"Cain got a milk-eyed mule from the auction
Abel got a telephone
And even the last of the blue-eyed babies know
That the burning man is the color of the end of day
And how every tongue that gets bit always has another word to say

Cain bought a blade from some witch at the window
Abel bought a bag of weed
And even the last of the brown-eyed babies see
That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
There ain't a penthouse Christian wants the pain of the scab, but they all want the scar
How every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of love
And how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking of

Cain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop
Abel heard his papa pray
And even the last of the black-eyed babies say
That every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sell
That the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen help
There's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall
And it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after all
How God knows if Christ came back he would find us in a poker game
After finding out the drugs were all free but they won't let you out the door again",2007
Dress Rehearsal Rag,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/dressrehearsalrag.html,"Four o'clock in the afternoon 
and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade? 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in? 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there; 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit; 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit; 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.",1971
Half a World Away,R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/halfaworldaway.html,"This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away here
And I had sworn to go it alone, hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone 'n hold it along
Hold

Oh, this lonely deeps and holy way
Half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life spent
I've had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed
To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here
To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone hold it along
Hold

Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along 'n hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away to go",1991

Wake Up,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/wakeup.html,"Somethinâ filled up
my heart with nothinâ.
Someone told me not to cry.

But now that Iâm older,
my heartâs colder,
and I can see that itâs a lie.

Children, wake up.
Hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children donât grow up,
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
Weâre just a million little gods causin' rain storms,
turninâ every good thing to rust.

I guess weâll just have to adjust.

With my lightninâ bolts a glowinâ,
I can see where I am goinâ to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightninâ bolts a glowinâ,
I can see where I am goinâ.
With my lightninâ bolts a glowinâ,
I can see where I am go -- goinâ!

Faith,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/faith.html,"Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time
I turn away
Lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly I see you change
Everything at once
The same
But the mountain never moves

Rape me like a child
Christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead
And old
And always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please
Say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand forever
Lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

I went away alone
With nothing left
But faith",1981

Before I get over you, doll
I bet it's gonna be a while now, kid
What with you living right up the hall

And I'm tired of living in this hotel
Snow and rain falling through the sheets
In fact I'm tired of 23rd Street
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night

Maybe you just didn't read me right
The lights went out and you just didn't understand
I played your song; I got the melody all wrong
Wound your shit up like some rubber bands

And I'm tired of living in this hotel
Fire and rain blowing through the streets
In fact I'm tired of 23rd Street
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night

I feel like getting rid of all my things
Maybe just disappear into the fog
The traffic roars; my stomach screams
Like a gang of angry dogs

And I'm tired of living here in this hotel
TV and dirty magazines
And I'm just trying to get a little sleep
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night",P:

Makes her body older than it really is.

No one's got much to say
in this town.
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down.

As strong as you were, tender you go.
I'm watching you breathing for the last time.
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet,
I know what it means and I'll carry you home.

If she had wings she would fly away,
And another day God will give her some.

As strong as you were, tender you go.

A song for your heart, but when it is quiet,
I know what it means and I'll carry you home.
I'll carry you home.

And they all born pretty in New York City tonight,
And someone's little girl was taken from the world tonight
Under the Stars and Stripes.

As strong as you were, tender you go.

Silver starlight breaks down the night

Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in your kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link

And taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in-between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life

A one-way street
She's walking to end of the line

The faces she keeps in her heart and mind

They say, ""Goodbye""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die

We can make believe that Kennedy is still alive
And we're shooting for the moon
And smiling Jackie's driving by

And they say, ""Good try""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked
The first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought it would get us
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Hey, hey, good bye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Only God says, ""Jump""
So I set the time
'Cause if he ever saw her
It was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered
It was me who did his crying

[lyrics by James LaBrie]

Why, tell me the reasons why
Try, still I don't understand
Will I ever feel this again
Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
Free them, free the memories of you
Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you

A day like today
My whole world has been changed
Nothing you say
Will help ease my pain

Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
Burn, burn to feel alive again
She, she'd want me to move on
See me, this place I still belong
Give chase, to find more than I have found
And face, this time now on my own

Days disappear
And my world keeps changing
I feel you here
And it keeps me sane

So I'm moving on
I'll never forget
As you lay there and watched me
Accepting the end
I knew you were scared
You were strong I was trying
I gave you my hand
I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
And I'll carry on
The best that I can without you here beside me
Let him come take you home",2002
River of Tears,Eric Clapton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ericclapton/riveroftears.html,"It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away,
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today.

It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face,
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace.

Lord, how long have I got to keep on running,
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is, since you've been gone
I feel like I'm drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feel like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river.

In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace.
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face.

I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain,
But my time's run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again.

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here.
You'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in the river.

Longing - cold and hollow
With sweet breath you'd come to warm me
But I held on too hard to only a memory
You lie there on the swollen ground
Deserted in your heart
Still longing for what yesterdays lost
And for all that tomorrow might bring
The passion lost - taken, stolen
The dreams we had and we shared - shattered, broken
With kind words you'd come to soothe me
But I go blind and filled with fear
Would send you away from me
There is no hope in regretting now
All the pain that we could not see
We both knew what we wanted
And we took it believing it free
And we took it believing it free.",1991

To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

My new nickname
Is ""You - Idiot""
(Such an idiot)
That's what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my
Phone

They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you
Waste your time
You know he ain't right

Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
Holding on
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you lost
And you wont realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Is really dumb

Ooh
No
No
No
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
In love",2009
I Never Learn,Lykke Li,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lykkeli/ineverlearn.html,"Where the blue moon shines
Where the tears melt ice
In a sea of guilt
By the fallen stars
Lonely chimes, sing of pain
There's a storm, only love remains

I've been stung by a star seed honey
He shone love like a lightning honey
I been hit by a star seed honey
His love burns like a lightning honey
I'm right here I'm your star crossed lover
I lie here like a starless lover
I'll die here as your phantom lover
I never learn, I never learn",2014
I'll Never Smile Again,Billie Holiday,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieholiday/illneversmileagain.html,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is true

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you",1959
Human,Krewella,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/krewella/human.html,"Is anybody there?
Does anybody care
What I'm feeling?
I wanna disappear
So nobody can hear
Me when I'm screamin'

'Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise
And you are just confused
But I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human
I am only human

The night is bitter cold
I wonder if you know
That I'm sleepless
Waitin' like a ghost
When I need you the most
That go unnoticed

'Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise
And you are just confused
But I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human

The weight of the world is pullin' me down
(Where are you now, where are you now?)
Every breath feels like I'm gonna drown
(Where are you now, where are you now?)
I'm the only one left alone on this Earth
Singin' this song but can't find the words

Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise
And you are just confused
But I am only human

I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human",2013
Go No More A-Roving,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/gonomorearoving.html,"[Dedicated to Irving Layton]

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.",2004
Climbing Up the Walls,Radiohead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiohead/climbingupthewalls.html,"I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement.
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection.

It's always best when the candle's out,
I am the pick in the ice.
Do not cry out or hit the alarm,
You know we're friends 'til we die.

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off,
It's always better on the outside.
Fifteen blows to the back of your head,
Fifteen blows to your mind.

So lock the kids up safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard.
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling.

That either way he turns - I'll be there
Open up your skull - I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls

Your New Twin Sized Bed,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/yournewtwinsizedbed.html,"You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed.
With a single pillow underneath your single head.
I guess you decided that that old queen was more space than you would need.
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment with a sign that says it's free.

And I hope you have more luck with this than me.

You used to think that someone would come along.
And lay beside you in a space that they belong.
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new.
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

Other than a sick desire for self-abuse.

And I try not to worry, but you've got me terrified.
It's like you're in some kind of hurry to say goodbye,

You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed.
You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed.",2008

To my right cross Seven Seas

Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me all through the night
Calendar girl who's in love with the world Stay alive
Calendar Girl who's in love with the world Stay alive

And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky
And said whoever is up there,please don't let me die
But I can't live forever,I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost

Stay Alive

Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,The Smiths,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smiths/heavenknowsimmiserablenow.html,"I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I naturally fled

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark

The night time is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired and send you to Mars
Night time is almost ours",2010

Oh, my love I've been denied it

I could play it by ear
Looking back at myself
While the violin plays
And blue is my tune
Another stitch to my wound
Another inch in this dwell
I know it all too well

All night long, laid on my pillow,
These things are wrong.
I can't sleep here!

So lovely, so lovely, so lovely.

I have decided to leave you forever.
I have decided to start things from here.
Thunder and lightning won't change,
What I'm feeling and the daffodils look lovely today,
And the daffodils look lovely today,
Look lovely today.

Ooh, in your eyes I can see the disguise.
Ooh, in your eyes I can see the dismay.
Has anyone seen lightning?
Has anyone looked lovely?
And the daffodils look lovely today,
And the daffodils look lovely today,
Look lovely today...

Mary,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/mary.html,"Mary walks
down to the water's edge
and there she hangs her head
to find herself faded
a shadow of what she once was
She said ""How long have I been sleeping
and why do I feel so old
why do I feel so cold
my heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go""
With trembling hands she reaches up
a stranger's flesh is offered
and I would be the last to know
I would be the last the let it show
I would be the last to go
Take her hand
she will lead you through the fire
give you back hope
and hope that you won't take too much
respecting what is left
she cradled us
she held us in her arms
unselfish in her suffering she could not understand
that no one seemed to have the time
to cherish what was given
and I would be the last to know
and I would be the last to let it show
I would be the last to go...

To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love",2008

Barricade,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/barricade.html,"Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
You were the only thing that mattered
There was no one for me but you
In Harmony Street we beat a man
Just for standing there
I held my breath as I watched you swing
Then run your fingers through your hair

Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do?
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you?

In Bermondsey in Burberry, you held me at the barricade, the pigs arrived with tear gas
And I wept at the mistakes we made
We stalked the streets like animals
And danced as windows shattered
For our island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered

Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart?
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart?

I found you on a Saturday, and that was where I lost you
You had finally walk away because of what it cost you, years later when I saw your face
In line to catch the morning train, you looked like you'd been softened
Like you never really loved the pain

Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish?
The thrill of blood comes instantly
There's only darkness at the finish

Meet me at the barricade, the love died, but the hate can't fade

A Comet Appears,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/acometappears.html,"One hand on this wily comet
Take a drink just to give me some weight
Some uber-man I'd make
I'm barely a vapor

They shone a chlorine light on
A host of individual sins
Let's carve my aging face off
Fetch us a knife
Start with my eyes
Down so the lines
Form a grimacing smile

Close your eyes to corral a virtue
Is this fooling anyone else?
Never worked so long and hard
To cement a failure

We can blow on our thumbs and posture
But the lonely are such delicate things
The wind from a wasp could blow them
Into the sea
With stones on their feet
Lost to the light and the loving we need

Still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing

With burnt sage and a forest of bygones
I click my heels
Get the devils in line
A list of things I could lay the blame on
Might give me a way out

But with each turn
It's this front and center
Like a dart stuck square in your eye
Every post you can hitch your faith on
Is a pie in the sky
Chock full of lies
A tool we devise
To make sinking stones fly

And still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing",2007

Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good

Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

Gather round all you clowns

And I don't go, really anywhere you know
I made up my mind, and I don't mind sayin so
I went to meet you at central square
When I couldn't find you there,
I went walking around the city some more
People watching with a cold blank stare
And I saw your face, in everyone I swear
Seems like I never get your kick quite right
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
High times
High times
High times, yea I feel fine
High times
High times
High times, man I feel fine
Don't pick me up I'm fine right where I am
I don't go, where I'm supposed go
Where I'm supposed to go",ompi
Don't Go Down,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/dontgodown.html,"I met a girl, a snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe had been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Stay with me 
Baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Stay",2004
Champagne From a Paper Cup,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/champagnefromapapercup.html,"I think i'm drunk enough to drive you home now
I'll keep my mouth kept shut from under lock and key
That's rusted firm, no lie
'cause all these conversations wind on and on...
Drinking champagne from a paper cup
Is never quite the same
And every sip's moving through my eyes 
And up into my brain
At half past two; about time to leave
'cause the dj's playing rhythm and blues
A sad-sorry state, stutter step to those slammin' grooves
As i'm waiting around for you...",emo 
Goodbye,Emmylou Harris,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/emmylouharris/goodbye.html,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I will never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye
No  I can't remember if we said goodbye
Goodbye goodbye",1995
I See a Darkness,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/iseeadarkness.html,"Well, you're my friend and can you see,
Many times we've been out drinkin',
Many times we've shared our thoughts,
But did you ever, ever notice, the kind of thoughts I got?

Well, you know I have a love, a love for everyone I know.
And you know I have a drive to live, I won't let go.
But can you see this opposition comes rising up sometimes?
That it's dreadful imposition, comes blacking in my mind.

And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.

Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you,
Can save me from this darkness.

Well, I hope that someday, buddy, we have peace in our lives.
Together or apart, alone or with our wives.
And we can stop our whoring and pull the smiles inside.
And light it up forever and never go to sleep.
My best unbeaten brother, this isn't all I see.

Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.

Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you,
Can save me from this darkness.",2002

Let's lose ourselves
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
It's a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom

How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I would still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom

No I don't think you do
There's no justice in the world
There's no justice in the world
And there never was",2006

Rest My Chemistry,Interpol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/interpol/restmychemistry.html,"I haven't slept for two days
I've bathed in nothing but sweat
And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret.
My friends they come.
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life in cocaine
Just a rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways
Such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You're so young. So sweet. So surprised

I saw a sign says ""OK""
Gotta take a ride just recline in the faraway
Got to take some time to realize
That my friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
So young. So sweet. So surprised
You look so young like a daisy in my lazy eyes

And wants the world to know,
just what her blues are all about,

She tells her side,
nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
when you get a bad start,
when you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
i know i won't die,
'cause i love him

In The Sun,Joseph Arthur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/josepharthur/inthesun.html,"I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You

I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there is anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me

Always
May God's love be with you",2000
I'll Fight,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/illfight.html,"I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you

I will, I will, I will

And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
On some old private hill abandoned by the mill
All my blood will spring and spill
I'll crash the air and be still

You'll wait with the star from a dream
And know that I am gone
You'll feel it in your heart
But not for very long

You'll rise each day as planned
Your will is your command
And stand each Sunday
A hymnal steady in your hand

And you'll sing to yourself
The rising falling melody
That you could never read
Without the choirs' lead
Still alone and lost in deep
And your soul will not be free

I will go, I will go, I will go
And in wars waters I will wade
And I will know if I remorse or regret
The fairness of our trade

For you to live, I took your place
A deal was made and I was paid
And the goal as I was told
Was a place where my body could be laid

And we will steal your life
And I own in better homes surrounded
By your peers without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near
And none will shed a tear
For the love no longer here

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I will
I'll fight, I'll fight,I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I will, I will, I will

I will
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
I will, I will, I will

And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
On a cross
My faith cannot by tossed
And my life will not be lost
If my love comes across",2009

But I can't find your clamshells
Your file or your drill
And your sheepskin-lined coat is eluding me still
And of course, you can't go without that

I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the dagger and oh why oh why
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
And of course, you can't go without that
You can't possibly go without that",2006

All my water colours fade to black
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm ten steps back
All my dreams have fallen flat

(Love don't show in the pavement cracks
There will be no turning back)

Time and space will pass us by and by
When we don't see eye to eye
I would have done anything
For happiness to bring ...
But it don't show up in the pavement cracks
I can't even cover up my tracks
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm light years back
Ooh I wish you well

How come
Every day
I'm still waiting for the change?
How come
I still say
Give me strength to live?

Where is my comfort zone?
A simple place to call my own
'Cause everything I wanna be
Comes crashing down on me
And it don't show up in the pavement cracks
I can't even recognise my tracks
You and I can't turn the whole thing back
Ooh I wish you well",2003

Title Track,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/titletrack.html,"Left uninspired by the crust of railroad earth that touched the lead to the pages of your manuscript.
I took my thumb off the concrete and saved up all my strength to hammer pillars for a picket fence.
It wasn't quiet what it seemed... a lack of pleasantries (my able body isn't what it used to be).
I must admit I was charmed by your advances... your advantage left me helplessly into you.
Talking how the group had begun to splinter and I could taste your lipstick on the filter...
I tried my best to keep my distance from your dress but call-response overturns conviction every time.
My memory cannot recall... a wave of alcohol we shared a cigarette and shaved the hours off.
Lushing with the hallway congregation, my best judgement signed its resignation.
I rushed this.
We moved too fast, and tripped into the guestroom.",2000

Everybody knows
That you cradle the sun, sun

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
I don't want to see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

Behind closed eyes lie
The minds ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures
Your not-so-gentle persuasion
Has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over

Don't you want to hold me baby
Disappointed, going crazy

Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Don't you want me to run

Even though you can't afford

Such a saint, but such a whore
So self-aware, so full of shit
So indecisive, so adamant
I'm contemplating, thinkin' about thinkin'
It's overrated, just get another drink and

Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray when I'm coming down, you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you, your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum, and I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone

So rock 'n' roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well-trained, so animal
So need your love, so fuck you all
I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to
If I stopped lying I'd just disappoint you

I come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
Come undone
I pray when I'm coming down, you'll be asleep
Come undone
If I ever hurt you, your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum, and I'm your son
I come undone

So write another ballad, mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song, a love song
Do another interview, sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs, we sing love songs so sincere

So sincere

Come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
Come undone
I pray when I'm coming down, you'll be asleep
Come undone
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
I come undone

Till the Sun Turns Black,Ray LaMontagne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/raylamontagne/tillthesunturnsblack.html,"Can you see the young and pretty
Confident as cops
Blooming, laughing in the shops
Till the sun turns black

Can you see the old and lonely
Walking through the park
Pushing grocery carts
Till the sun turns black

Can you see the corporate man
He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black

Can you see him in his lounger
Watching TV in the dark
Waiting for a spark
Till the sun turns black

Oh oh oh oh oh
Who are we
Oh oh oh oh oh
Who are we
Who are we

Can you see the working classes
Trudging through their days
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting
Till the sun turns black

Can you see the wise man simply
Living, loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity
Till the sun turns black",2006
I Know It's Over,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/iknowitsover.html,"Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed - oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling, I don't know where else I can go
Over and over...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit (cut) me
Do you think you can help me
Sad veiled bride please be happy - handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you - and I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go - over and over...
I know it's over and it never really began but in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said
""If you're so funny, then why are you on your own tonight?""
""And if you're so clever then why are you on your own tonight?""
""And if you're so very entertaining then why are you on your own tonight?""
""And if you're so very good looking, then why do you sleep alone tonight?""
I know - 'cos tonight is just like any other night - that's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms - while they're in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind - over and over...
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes guts to be gentle and kind - over and over...
Love is natural and real - but not for you my love not tonight my love
Love is natural and real - but not for such as you and I my love
Oh mother... [etc.]",P:  
Pretty (Ugly Before),Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/prettyuglybefore.html,"Sunshine been keeping me up for days
There is no nighttime, it's only a passing phase

Sometimes is all I feel up to now
But it's not worth it to you, 'cos you gotta get high somehow
Is it destruction that you're required to feel?
Like somebody wants you, someone that's more for real?

I've Tried Everything,Eurythmics,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eurythmics/ivetriedeverything.html,"The truth of life is the greatest gift

Who would've thought that you could feel such pain
When you've tried everything

Yea.. you're a loser now
Yea.. you're a loser now

And again
And then again

Waiting by the telephone
Whatever you do
Don't call daddy

And everywhere
Fingerprints of you
Filthy daddy

Wash and mend
And wash and mend
Some kind of friend
Your septic heart and deadly hand
Loved me black and blue
No more sorry",1988
Sleep,The Roots,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roots/sleep.html,"[Verse 1: Aaron Livingston]
Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
Iâve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldnât wish them on than worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
Iâm dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
Iâm fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
Itâs unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

[Verse 3: Aaron Livingston]
I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves",2011

Wo keiner von uns war
Rastlos waren wir

Worauf wir warten, das ist hier
Siehst du die Zeichen
Liebe und Zorn
Alles was bleibt
Ist eine Flucht nach Vorn

Wir zogen zu weit aus
Dein Herz bricht alle Schranken
Was uns jetzt noch fÃ¼hrt
Ist der Abgrund, den wir fanden

You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

Oh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why",2011
Miami,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/miami.html,"I guess I think I feel alright
You come circling through the light
The skyline, baby, is bright tonight
That more perfect rendezvous
The sundown paints the shadows through
The daylight, Amy, on what we do

It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
Miami

Can I say
I wish that this weather would never leave
It just gets hard to believe
That god sent this angel to watch over me
Cause my angel
She don't receive my calls
Says I'm too dumb to fuck
Too dumb to fight
Too dumb to save
Well maybe I don't need no angel at all

It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
She could pull the sunlight through me
Coming down into Miami

Make a circle in the sand
Make a halo with your hands
I'll make a place for you to land

The bus is running
It's time to leave
The summer is gone and so are we
So come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans

Come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Oh yeah
Come on baby
Come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Come on, come on, come on

Take It With Me,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/takeitwithme.html,"Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I
Drank champagne
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Old long since gone
Now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing
Ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Far far away a train
Whistle blows
Wherever you're goin
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end
Of the day
You're up and you're over
And you're far away

Always for you, and
Forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

All broken down by
The side of the road
I was never more alive or
Alone
I've worn the faces off
All the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Children are playing
At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn
It's got to be more
Than flesh and bone
All that you've loved
Is all you own

In a land there's a town
And in that town there's
A house
And in that house
There's a woman
And in that woman
There's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go",1999
What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted,Jimmy Ruffin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmyruffin/whatbecomesofthebrokenhearted.html,"As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere...",
If I Was Your Vampire,Marilyn Manson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/ifiwasyourvampire.html,"6 a.m. Christmas morning.
No shadows,
No reflections here.
Lying cheek to cheek
In your cold embrace.

So soft and so tragic
As a slaughterhouse.
You press the knife
Against your heart.
And say,
""I love you, so much you must kill me now.""

I love you
So much
You must kill me now.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come.

Digging your smile apart
With my spade-tounge.
The hole is where the heart is.
We built this tomb together,
And I won't fill it alone.
Beyond the pale
Everything is black,
No turning back.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.

If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart,
This is where it starts...
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart,
This is where it starts.
This is where it will end.
Here comes the moon again.

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain.
You'll burn,
I'll eat your ashes.
The impossible wheels seducing
Our corpse.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face
Because I think
Our time has come.

Beyond the pale
Everything is black
No turning back.
Beyond the pale
Everything's black
No turning back.

This is where it starts.
This is where it will end.
Here comes the moon again.

Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive

Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

All the errors left unlearned, oh
Well I'm the luckiest guy

Sometimes it Snows in April,Prince,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/prince/sometimesitsnowsinapril.html,"Tracy died soon after our long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here

I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past",ound
This Ruined Puzzle,Dashboard Confessional,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dashboardconfessional/thisruinedpuzzle.html,"This ruined puzzle is beige with the pieces all face down
so the placing goes slowly.
The picture's of anything other than it's mean to be.
But the hours they creep,
the patterns repeat.
Don't be concerned, you know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said ""don't go.""

I've hidden a note,
it's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back.
It says, ""Does he ever get the girl?""
But what if the pages stay pressed,
the chapters unfinished,
the storied too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?

This basement's a coffin.
I'm buried alive.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
'Cause you're gone.
I get nothing
and you're off with barely a sigh.
I never said, ""Goodbye.""

it's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back.
It says, ""Does he ever get the girl?""

Regret,Anathema,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anathema/regret.html,"As I drift away... far away from you,
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Thinking to myself
""There's no escape from this
fear,
regret,
loneliness...""

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

I wish I didn't know now that
I never knew then...
Flashback
Memories punish me once again
Sometimes I remember all the pain
that I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might
have been...

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way
My future is not set
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live
without regret.

Long Gone,Syd Barrett,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sydbarrett/longgone.html,"She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind
the beauty of love's in her eyes...

She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I borrowed the page
from a leopard's cage
and I prowled in the evening sun's glaze
her head lifted high to the light in the sky
the opening dawn on her face...

She was long gone long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind

And No More Shall We Part,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/andnomoreshallwepart.html,"And no more shall we part
It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me

And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up, 
The ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depths of winter

And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of birds will sing to your 
beautiful heart
Upon the bough

And no more shall we part
Your chain of command 
Has been silenced now
And all of those birds 
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
Anyhow

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I will never be free
If I'm not free now

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I never was free

Alone You Breathe,Savatage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savatage/aloneyoubreathe.html,"You were never one for waiting
Still I always thought you'd wait for me
Have you from your dream awakened
And from where you are what do you see

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You're thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder
Staring from this end into your life

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

And if this is all illusion
Nothing more than pure delusion
Clinging to a fading fantasy

Like Icarus who heeds the calling
Of a sun but now is falling
As the feathers of his life fall free
Can you see
See

Tomorrow
And after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here
Believing
That in the dark
There is a clue

Perhaps inside
This midnight sky
Perhaps tomorrow's new born eyes
Or could it be
We'll never know
And after all
This was the show

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Standing on a dream
Isn't what it seems
Could we then reclaim a dream refused
Knowing what we know
Could we let it go
Realizing that all the years are used

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue
I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue",1994

I saw a light
Coming through the trees
I saw a light
Coming through the trees

And little children sleepwalking
I saw a light

I saw a light
Shining on a car
And a couple inside
Had committed suicide

Death in your arms
Death in your arms

I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
And I packed my things

After I saw the light
I packed my things
The light gave me life
Helped me see more clearly
And the children went to sleep
And the car was towed away
And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day

I saw a light
Getting smaller in the distance
And I said goodbye",2006
If I Fall,Amber Pacific,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amberpacific/ififall.html,"This is for the ones who believe their lives won't change
Hoping that someday things will mend and be the same
This is for the ones who have lost it all when all that's left to gain
Is a simple reminder that the things that were blind to slip away...

How can I say...
Say I'll be okay...

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

Now that the lines been broken
I'm too afraid to just look back
The pages have left an empty space 
You were all I had
Why does it have to be this way
These things they'll never change
Still I'm left with knowing, content and happy, this is all I need...

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause

Tell Me Why,Cold,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cold/tellmewhy.html,"I could see her fall from grace
Like a movie star too old to change her life
With a bottle by her hand
Every night she went away
I would pray for someone else to change her life
If she wouldn't change for me

Tell me why. Please tell me why. You stole my life

Tired of hearing the same old song
Everytime you came back frozen deep inside
Was it my love that you feared
I was a misfit all the way
Never there to help me grow and change my life
Then you smiled and walked away

Tell me why
Please tell me why
You stole my life
Tell me why

All the little things she said to me
Were broken thoughts and tainted dreams
If she can't take these memories
It doesn't change a thing
Every little word she said to me
That broke my heart and stayed with me
I wish that she could hear me scream
She never changed a thing

Tell me why
Please tell me why
You stole my life... life
Please tell me why

This can't go on!",2005
Never Born,Guano Apes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/guanoapes/neverborn.html,"Love is like a shelter
brings me through the storm
Life is full of anger
maybe I'm dead again now
maybe there's life in me
so much stronger than the world gives it to me
here's the deal, leave it or not
what a surprise, your baby's unborn

Nothing else is deeper
Nothing else is good
Noone cares about the blood in you

I see you through that all
I feel you through the wall
Save my child and I save...

I in me and you are here now
Hold it, save it, never let me down again

I don't feel the darkness
don't feel anything
pressure's lost and pressure's good in me
don't move and don't hide secrets
play hard, don't play alone
move the soul without your own control

Nothing else is deeper ...

I in me and you are here now ...

What'cha sayin' ...
watch again...
why you're here...
noone cares...

I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box),Doug Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dougstone/idbebetteroffinapinebox.html,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Girl I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back from Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind",1990
Space Bound,Eminem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/spacebound.html,"We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is ""evol""
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova... and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you",2010
Dizzy,Ours,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ours/dizzy.html,"We ran
We starved the things

I need them now
To save me

We fell, when they choked the things that feed
How come... we hurt the one's we need?
Lay down, and stretch upon the sea

You Would Have Loved This,Tarja,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tarja/youwouldhavelovedthis.html,"The winter left her blanket
here this morning
A soft and gentle coverlet of white
Unfolded in the shadows of the dawn
It Sparked in the early morning light
You would have loved this
You would have loved this
This was your favorite time of day
The greenery is laid across the mantle
And ornaments are hanging on the tree
And cradled in the windowsill's a candle
A beacon in the night
to call you back to me
You would have loved this
You always loved this
I know you loved this time of year
And though I understand
One day again I'll see you
I long to touch your hand,
hear your voice, feel you
You would have loved this
You always loved this
Oh, how you loved.",2006

Letting you guide me home
Watching you grow, letting you know
You are my only

You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me

Tell you my fears, telling you everything
Telling the truth to you gives me wings
Free with my words, free as a bird
I am flying high looking at you
Everything new, you are my life

So happy to carry you inside me

You'll be filling out the quiet

When the world is frozen over
And the oceans are on fire
When the darkness overpowers light
And the angels muted choir
I will hide here in the meadows

Best when I forgive
I will love you best when I forgive
Cause you made your promises
Not a one of them you kept

Alexandra Leaving,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/alexandraleaving.html,"Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Itâs not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked â
Do not choose a cowardâs explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost",2001
Take This Waltz,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/takethiswaltz.html,"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears? 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!"" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is",1988

Waiting for the Miracle,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/waitingforthemiracle.html,"Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb: 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.",1992
Avalanche,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/avalanche.html,"Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul; 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold; 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind; 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed; 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor; 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.",1971
The Traitor,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/thetraitor.html,"Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere"" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan"" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face",1979
River of Sorrow,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/riverofsorrow.html,"There is a black river
It passes by my window
And late at night
All dolled up like Christ
I walk the water
Between the piers

Singing
Oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

For we all know the baby has expired
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
And no precious liar or well-wisher
Can return the love that was stolen

So oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Can you see the light
At the end of the dark passageway?
Take me with you towards the light
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Hear me, I'm whispering in your ear

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time

Black Wave/Bad Vibrations,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/blackwavebadvibrations.html,"We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me

Stop now before it's too late 
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you 
For me
It's always for you 

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me

Stop now before it's too late
Your lover was for hire
Have you noticed he's been late
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you

The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet",2007

I am a bird girl

Here in my hands

Gonna be born

Teachers,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/teachers.html,"I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord? 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost? 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect? 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you? 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess? 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done? 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done?",1967
Speed Trials,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/speedtrials.html,"He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials all over the place",1997
Ballad of Big Nothing,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/balladofbignothing.html,"Throwing candy out to the crowd, dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley, having had enough of it all

Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you

All spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger

You can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you
Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to though it doesn't mean a thing
Big nothing",1997
Master Song,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/mastersong.html,"I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread? 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread?",1967
Crown of Love,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/crownoflove.html,"They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it 
I carved your name across my eyelids 
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because the spark is not within me. 

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The only thing that you keep changin' is your name
My love keeps growin' still the same 
Just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me 
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because your hands are not upon me. 

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The pains of love
And they keep growin', 
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
It's not within me.
It's not within me.
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say!
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!
Only word that I can say!",2004
Winter,The Dodos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dodos/winter.html,"I know if I'll make it through this winter without you by my side
I waited for you so long while I traveled far and wide
Convinced myself there's no one better, so how could I deny
Your love, it's like a thorn into my side

My friends they understand me better but don't whisper goodnight
I want a lover and a sister, but we know that's not right
You used to listen to my music, I always wondered why
I wish I could pretend you make me try

I want the days to come, I want these sleepless nights to end
I lie here thinking how I lost you to all your stupid friends
You made me feel so foolish for the twenty-second time
Your love might be the last time that I try

Don't know if I'll make it through this winter without you on my own
I waited here for you forever, I can't believe you'd go
I may not have the answers, but I'd rather never know
Your love was such a heavy, heavy blow

Goodnight my love, you seemed so nice 'til I knew you better
Now I can tell you're always thinking twice about what might be better
On the outside, there's no conscience, you're a victim of your cautiousness
You don't try, you just lie there hoping that someone will come to make it right",2008
Blue Ridge Mountains,Fleet Foxes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fleetfoxes/blueridgemountains.html,"Lie down with me, my dear
Lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me anytime you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-alikes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But, Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind
No",2008

Said the music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
And I was glad that I did this time

And the song said ""Let's be happy,"" I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

And the song said ""Let's be happy,"" I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

And the song said ""Let's be happy,"" I was happy
It never made me happy before
It asked ""Do you remember?"" and I remember
Remember like it wasn't long ago

And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely

Carry the Zero,Built to Spill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/builttospill/carrythezero.html,"I'm not knocking your want to carry that home
Took it with you when you moved and got it broke
Found the pieces, we counted them all alone
Didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero

I can't be your apologist very long
I'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on
Count your blemishes, you can't, they're all gone
I can't see your response putting them back on

Like they're waiting for your guard to fall
So they can see it all and you're so
Occupied with what other persons are
Occupied with, and vice versa

And you've become what you thought was dumb
A fraction of the sum
Yeah, you've become, yeah, you have become
A fraction of the sum, the middle and the front

And now it's coming back
Hasn't it come too far?
I was trying to help, but
I guess I pushed too hard

Now we can't even touch it
Afraid it'll fall apart",1999
Tomorrow Tomorrow,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/tomorrowtomorrow.html,"Everybody knows which way you go, straight to over
No one wants to see you inside of me, straight to over

Say you're deaf and dumb and done
Give yourself another talk 
This time make it sound like someone

The noise is coming out, and if it's not out now
Then tomorrow, tomorrow
They took your life apart and called you failure's art
They were wrong though, they won't know
'Til tomorrow

I got static in my head
The reflected sound of everything
Tried to go to where it led
But it didn't lead to anything

The noise is coming out, but if it's not out now
I know it's just about to drown tomorrow out",1998
Lion's Mane,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/lionsmane.html,"Run like a race for family
When you hear like you're alone
The rusted gears of morning
To faceless busy phones
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone

Love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
Love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
Love is the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thornbush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh

Love is a scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
Love's a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
Love is the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's mane",2002
Displaced,Azure Ray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/azureray/displaced.html,"It's just a simple line

I'll know that nothing
nothing survives
nothing survives

I think I'm turned around
I'm looking up not looking down
and when I'm standing still
watching you run
watching you fall, fall into me

Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase

I am displaced, I am displaced

And shes my friend of all friends
shes still here when everyone's gone
she doesn't have to say a thing
we'll just keep laughing 
all night long, all night long

Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase

I am displaced, I am displaced

I know that no one

The Drinks We Drank Last Night,Azure Ray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/azureray/thedrinkswedranklastnight.html,"Riding on these waves,
holding on to what you say,
""Everything will be okay,
it will work out one way.""

But I've drifted way too far,
my arms, my legs, have grown too tired.
And could you be inspired?
No, I'm just tired.

And on a swing you push me hard,
so I'll come back to where you are.
And you know I'm never far.
No decisions, nothing hard.

And I knew that it would rain tonight,
I'll take the bus or the next flight.
I won't give up on what feels right.

If you see these tears filling my eyes,
it's just the wind that makes me cry.
If you could feel this pain inside,
it's from the drinks we drank last night.
It's from the drinks we drank last night.  

And the shadow of our past,
projects on clouds of dust and gas.
Wounds where my eyes will rest,
the silhouette of loneliness.  

If you see these tears filling my eyes,
it's just the wind that makes me cry.
If you could feel this pain inside,
it's from the drinks we drank last night.
It's from the drinks we drank last night.",2003
I Better Be Quiet Now,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/ibetterbequietnow.html,"Wish you gave me your number

If I didn't know the difference
Living alone'd probably be okay
It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
A lot of hours to occupy
It was easy when I didn't know you yet
Things I'd have to forget
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, and getting upset
Maybe I got a problem
But that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet
Wish I knew what you were doing
And why you want to do it this way

On the street, by the beach
Or places we used to go

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose

Tell me baby tell me
Does his company make 
Light of a rainy day
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak 
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose

Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change
I've been thinking lately
of a night on the stoop
and all that we wouldn't say

On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
Out from under my nose",2002

To tussling in the waves

Now I see love
Dragged on the floor where you walked outside
Now I seek love
Looking for you in this other girl's eyes

Time and all you took
Only my freedom to fuck the whole world
Promising not to look
Promising light on the sidewalk girls

Now I see love
There in your car where I said those things
Now I see love
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Time and all you gave
There on your cross that I never saw
Well beyond the waves
Dunking my head when I heard you call

Now I see love
There in the scab where you pinched my leg
Now I see love
There on your side of my empty bed",2002
Upward Over the Mountain,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/upwardoverthemountain.html,"Mother, don't worry. I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother, don't worry. I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother, remember being so stern with that girl who was with me?
Mother, remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body?

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying upwards over the mountain

Mother, I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
Mother, I lost it all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother, forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother, forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain

Mother, don't worry. I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother, don't worry. She's got a garden we're planting together
Mother, remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws,
And you cried 'til the morning.

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying always over the mountain",2002

Weak or strong

Joey, I'm not angry anymore

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too...

But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and
Passed out on the floor...

Oh...
Joey, I'm not angry anymore
Angry anymore, angry anymore",1990
The Big Fight,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/thebigfight.html,"How could you do it
I couldnt say
Years built on sand
June until may
Second to second
Lied even while you held my hand

Its death for the living
Yes i am a ghost
The mirror is cloudy
I loved you the most
You threw out the pieces
Did things we didnt understand

He doesnt want her but he just wont let her go
She started breaking but she still wont let it show

The clothes in the wardrobe
Just send them to me
Theres bills her for you
Thats cause nothing is free
We build up with things
To make us who we want to be

Is she in the background
I just wouldnt know
Did i build you a prison
Please dont let me go
Ive unlocked the doors
But you cant walk away from me

He doesnt want her but he just wont let her go
She started breaking but she still wont let it show
He doesnt want her but he just wont let her go",2004

Blue,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/blue.html,"Blue, songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue, THERE is a song for you
Ink ON A Pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there's so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue, I love you

Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me",1971
If I Needed You,Townes Van Zandt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/townesvanzandt/ifineededyou.html,"If I needed you
Would you come to me,
Would you come to me,
And ease my pain? 
If you needed me
I would come to you
I'd swim the seas
For to ease your pain

In the night forlorn
The morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love
You will miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
That would break
My heart in two

The lady's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay her lily
Hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree
She's a sight to see
And a treasure for
The poor to find",1972
I Cried for You,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/icriedforyou.html,"You're beautiful so silently 
It lies beneath a shade of blue 
It struck me so violently 
When I looked at you 

But others pass, the never pause, 
To feel that magic in your hand 
To me you're like a wild rose 
They never understand why 

I cried for you 
When the sky cried for you 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter 
But this life was not for you 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper 

I'll cross the sea for a different world, 
With your treasure, a secret for me to hold 

In many years they may forget 
This love of ours or that we met, 
They may not know 
how much you meant to me. 

I cried for you 
And the sky cried for you, 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter. 
But this life was not for you, 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper 

Without you now I see, 
How fragile the world can be 
And I know you've gone away 
But in my heart you'll always stay. 

I cried for you 
And the sky cried for you,

Where Do The Children Play?,Cat Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catstevens/wheredothechildrenplay.html,"Well I think it's fine, building Jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas
And you make them long, and you make them tough
But they just go on and on, and it seems you can't get off

Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air
Will you keep on building higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?",1970

My long lost friend?
It's good to see you again.
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye.
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace.
Can't you hear it calling?
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.

Love's taken you far
Away from my heart,
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine,
A vision that's faded through time?
But you sailed away,
A fine summer's day,
Cause you heard it calling,
A new day dawning,
You were longing to find.

There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are

50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/50waystoleaveyourlover.html,"""The problem is all inside your head""
She said to me
""The answer is easy if you
Take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle
To be free
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover""

She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning
Won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself
At the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover""

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said, ""It grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again""
I said, ""I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""

She said, ""Why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light""
And then she kissed me
And I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan

Just drop off the key, Lee

Goodbye to Love,Carpenters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carpenters/goodbyetolove.html,"I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love
has passed me by
And all I know of love
is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it.

So I've made my mind up I must live
my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love.

There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories

And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for.

All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my
only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can.

What lies in the future
is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune
as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that
I've been wrong
But for now this is my song.

And it's goodbye to love

I'll say goodbye to love.",1972
If You Go Away,Scott Walker,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/ifyougoaway.html,"If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird's song

If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees
And worship the wind

Then if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world
To stop turning, turning
'til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you?
Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
'til the next hello

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
Though the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow
Of your shadow
If it might have kept me
By your side",1969
Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,Roberta Flack,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertaflack/willyoustilllovemetomorrow.html,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",1971
Saturday Sun,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/saturdaysun.html,"Saturday sun
Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Saturday sun
Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday's sun
Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by",1969
Free Until They Cut Me Down,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/freeuntiltheycutmedown.html,"When the men take me to the devil tree

When the wind wraps me like the reaper's hand 
I will swing free until they cut me down 
Papa don't tell me what I could've done 
She's the one who begged me 
""Take me home"" 

When the sea takes me like my mother's arms 
I will breathe free as any word of God

I Hung My Head,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/ihungmyhead.html,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practise my aim

My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind.
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find.""

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Upon a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'd ride together
To Kingdom come
I prayed for God's mercy
For soon I'd be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head",2002

The Good That Won't Come Out,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/thegoodthatwontcomeout.html,"Let's get together and talk about the modern age
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets just talking shit
About how we're all so upset about the dissapearing ground
As we watch it melt

It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them, standing here on this frozen lake

I do this thing where i think i'm real sick
But i won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stand real still in a real small place
As they chartup your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies i hide behind
It's such a big mistake, lying here in your warm embrace

Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again
I think i'll go out and embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say i choose sadness, that it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right

Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

It's all of the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
It's such a big mistake, standing here on this frozen lake
It's all the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust
If i don't tell you quick
Standing here on this frozen lake",2002

By power cuts and blackouts
Sleeping like babies

With Every Heartbeat,Robyn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robyn/witheveryheartbeat.html,"Maybe we could make it all right
We could make it better sometime
Maybe we could make it happen, baby

We could keep trying but things will never change

So I don't look back
Still I'm dying with every step I take
But I don't look back

Just a little, little bit better
Good enough to waste some time
Tell me, would it make you happy, baby

I Can See Clearly Now,Johnny Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnynash/icanseeclearlynow.html,"I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky

I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Gonna be a bright, bright, bright sun-shining day",ompi
Remember a Day,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/rememberaday.html,"Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play along with time
Evening never comes

Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish
Look for your king

Why can't we play today?
Why can't we stay that way?

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away

Why can't we reach the sun?
Why can't we blow the years away?

Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember",1968

Love's a Loaded Gun,Alice Cooper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alicecooper/lovesaloadedgun.html,"[Alice Cooper/Jack Ponti/Vic Pepe]

Somebody saw you at the station
You had your suitcase in your hand
You didn't give no information
You walked off with another man
I'm always standing in the shadows, baby
I watched you give yourself away
You take them home into your bedroom
You had another busy day

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits
I can't take it

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Someday they'll put me in a squad car
Someday they'll throw away the key
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog
Cuz that's what you taught me to be

You looked into the eyes of men above you
I was the one who really tried to love you

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Pull the trigger

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You know, you push me right to the limit
I can't take it

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun

Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't

I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't

I will never leave you

Get Big,Okkervil River,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/okkervilriver/getbig.html,"Once we get to the end of this song, 
then it will begin again.
So you said in our bed. 
I was watching light slip through blinds to find your skin. 

""So take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been.
Live your lost weekend,I know you've wanted it. Get big, little kid. 

And I can't say why each day doesn't quite fit the space we saved for it.""
But if that space now demands that you throw up both your hands and call it quits... 

""Take your midnight trip. I know you've dreamed of it. 
Walk your sunset strip, because I think you've needed it to get big, little kid. 

But just remember that our love only got this good
because of the younger days that you'd like to outstrip. 
So drink your cup down to the dregs and leave that club on shaking legs
with another guy, but remember: I'm not him. 

Take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been. 
Live your lost weekend, I know you've wanted it. 
Get big, little kid. 

And once we get to the end of this song, then another will begin.",2005
The Night Starts Here,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/thenightstartshere.html,"The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear

The pleasure part, the afterthought, the missing stone in the graveyard
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to become a man
The dust at dawn is rained upon, attaches itself to everyone
No one is spared, no one is clean
It travels places you've never been or seen before

The night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea, and shout out ""Please come back to me""
You name your child after your fear, and tell them ""I have brought you here""

The scary part, the aftershock, the moment it takes to fall apart
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to destroy a man
The ecstasy, the being free, the big black cloud over you and me
And after that, the upwards fall, and were we angels after all?
I don't know, I don't know...

The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear

Song for Sharon,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/songforsharon.html,"I went to Staten Island.
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars...
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, ""Have children!""
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want right now
Is...find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by",1976
The Golden Age,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/thegoldenage.html,"Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead

These days I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when it's day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're OK

These days I barely get by
I don't even try",2002
Nobody's Fault But My Own,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/nobodysfaultbutmyown.html,"Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang
And let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew
It could be so sweet
Who could ever be so cruel,
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
That it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights
The way for you
When the road is full of nails,
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues
Are full of heartless tales
That drain on you
Who would ever notice you
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

Nobody's fault But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault

Where are you going
I have a hiding place
When spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me
I hear them calling
Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

Greeting the monster in our Easter dresses
Father says bow your head like the good book says
Well I think the good book is missing some pages
Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

And when my hand touches myself
I can finally rest my head
And when they say take of his body
I think I'll take from mine instead

Getting off
Getting off
While they're all downstairs
Singing prayers
Sing away
He's in my pumpkin p.j.'s
Lay your book on my chest
Feel the word
Feel the word
Feel the word
The word feel it

I should have
I could have flown
You know I could have

Daredevil,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/daredevil.html,"I guess I just must be a daredevil

I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot
Not so with the warmer lot
And all I want is a confidant
To help me laugh it off

And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Say I'm an airplane
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing
And I use them to give me lip
Hip hip for the lift
Hip hip for the drag
I want them all in my bag
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Seek me out
Look at, look at, look at, look at me
I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up
Give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you
And never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
Skirt in my skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone",2012
Kenji,Fort Minor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fortminor/kenji.html,"My father came from Japan in 1905
He was 15 when he immigrated from Japan
He worked until he was able to buy respect and build a store

Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream,
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means,
Close your eyes, just picture the scene,
As I paint it for you, it was World War II,
When this man named Kenji woke up,
Ken was not a soldier,
He was just a man with a family who owned a store in LA,
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did,
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids,
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran,
He moved to LA from Japan,
They called him 'Immigrant,'
In Japanese, he'd say he was called ""Issei,""
That meant 'First Generation In The United States,'
When everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs,
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack,
And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat,
His world went black 'cause,
Right there; front page news,
Three weeks before 1942,
""Pearl Harbour's Been Bombed And The Japs Are Comin',""
Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin',
Ken knew what it would lead to,
Just like he guessed, the President said,
""The evil Japanese in our home country will be locked away,""
They gave Ken, a couple of days,
To get his whole life packed in two bags,
Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes,
Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in,
So two trash bags is all they gave them,
When the kids asked mom ""Where are we goin'?""
Nobody even knew what to say to them,
Ken didn't wanna lie, he said ""The US is lookin' for spies,
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar,
Where a lot of Japanese people are,""
Stop it don't look at the gunmen,
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',
If you gonna run or not,
'Cause if you run then you might get shot,
Other than that try not to think about it,
Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded,
Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.

As soon as war broke out
The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and
""You have to come""
""All the Japanese have to go""
They took Mr. Ni
People didn't understand
Why did they have to take him?
Because he's an innocent laborer

So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them,
Every day, every night look down at them,
From watch towers up on the wall,
Ken couldn't really hate them at all;
They were just doin' their job and,
He wasn't gonna make any problems,
He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that,
He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made,
But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved,
Prisoners of war in their own damn country,
What for?
Time passed in the prison town,
He wondered if they would live it down, if and when they were free,
The only way out was joinin' the army,
And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on,
And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb,
That 15 kilotonne blast, put an end to the war pretty fast,
Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick,
Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife,
But, when they got back to their home,
What they saw made them feel so alone,
These people had trashed every room,
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors,
Written on the walls and the floor,
""Japs not welcome anymore.""
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside,
He, looked at his wife without words to say,
She looked back at him wiping tears away,
And, said ""Someday we'll be OK, someday,""
Now the names have been changed, but the story's true,
My family was locked up back in '42,
My family was there it was dark and damp,
And they called it an internment camp

When we first got back from camp... uh
It was... pretty... pretty bad

I, I remember my husband said
""Are we gonna stay 'til last?""
Then my husband died before they close the camp.",2005

Sprout and the Bean,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/sproutandthebean.html,"I slept all day
I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved

That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string

And you can ask the counselor
And you can ask the king
And I'll say the same thing
And it's a funny thing

Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?

And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams
Of lead

When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
In the dirt of the day

And danger, danger drawing near them was a white coat
And danger, danger drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water, water running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter of the talking of the tadpoles

Who know the outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?",2004
Monkey & Bear,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/monkeybear.html,"Down in the green hay
Where Monkey and Bear usually lay
They woke from a stable-boy's cry

Said, ""Someone come quick
The horses got loose, got grass-sick
They'll founder, Fain, they'll die""

What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?
By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey?
It is, stay by the gate you are given
And remain in your place, for your season
And had the overfed dead but listened
To the high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom

""Did you hear that, Bear?""
Said Monkey, ""We'll get out of here, fair and square
They left the gate open wide
So, my bride, here is my hand, where is your paw?
Try and understand my plan, Ursula
My heart is a furnace full of love that's just, and earnest
Now, you know that we must unlearn this
Allegiance to a life of service
And no longer answer to that heartless
Hay-monger, nor be his accomplice
The charlatan, with artless hustling
But Ursula, we've got to eat something
And earn our keep, while still within
The borders of the land that man has girded
All double-bolted and tightfisted
Until we reach the open country
A-steeped in milk and honey
Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me?
Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?
My love, I swear by the air I breathe
Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth

But for now, just dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon will you dance, my darling?
The hills are groaning with excess
Like a table ceaselessly being set
My darling we will get there yet""

They trooped past the guards
Past the coops, and the fields, and the farmyards
All night, till finally
The space they gained grew
Much farther than the stone that bear threw
To mark where they'd stop for tea

But, ""Walk a little faster, don't look backwards
Your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture
And the blackbirds hear tea whistling and rise and clap
Their applause caws the kettle black
And we can't have none of that
Move along, Bear, there, there, that's that""

Though cast in plaster
Our Ursula's heart beat faster
Than Monkey's ever will

But still, they have got to pay the bills
Hadn't they? That is what the monkey'd say
So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur
Or a kite, jerking tight at its tether
In her dun-brown gown of fur
And her jerkin of swansdown and leather
Bear would sway on her hindlegs
The organ would grind dregs of song for the pleasure
Of the children who'd shriek
Throwing coins at her feet then recoiling in terror

Sing, ""Dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon, will you dance, my darling?
You keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill
Where you'll ever-after eat your fill
Oh my darling, dear mine, if you dance
Dance darling and I'll love you still""

Deep in the night shone a weak and miserly light where the monkey shouldered his lamp
Someone had told him the bear'd been wandering a fair piece away from where they were camped
Someone had told him the bear had been sneaking away to the seaside caverns, to bathe
And the thought troubled the monkey for he was afraid of spelunking down in those caves
Also afraid what the village people would say if they saw the bear in that state
Lolling and splashing obscenely well, it seemed irrational, really washing that face
Washing that matted and flea-bit pelt in some sea-spit-shine, old kelp dripping with brine
But Monkey just laughed, and he muttered, ""When she comes back, Ursula will be bursting with pride
Till I jump up saying, 'You've been rolling in muck,' saying, 'You smell of garbage and grime'""

But far out, far out
By now, by now
Far out, by now, Bear ploughed
'Cause she would not drown

First the outside-legs of the bear up and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters
Then the outside-arms of the bear fell off, as easy as if sloughed from boiled tomatoes
Lowered in a genteel curtsy, bear shed the mantle of her diluvian shoulders
And, with a sigh, she allowed the burden of belly to drop, like an apron full of boulders
If you could hold up her threadbare coat to the light, where it's worn translucent in places
You'd see spots where, almost every night of the year, Bear had been mending, suspending that baseness
Now her coat drags through the water, bagging, with a life's-worth of hunger, limitless minnows
In the magnetic embrace, balletic and glacial, of Bear's insatiable shadow

Left there, left there
When Bear left bear
Left there, left there
When Bear stepped clear of Bear

Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth",2006
Sawdust & Diamonds,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/sawdustdiamonds.html,"From the top of the flight of the wide white stairs

Drop a bell down the stairs, hear it fall forever more
Hear it fall forever more

Drop a bell off of the dock
Blot it out in the sea
Drowning mute as a rock
And sounding mutiny

There's a light in the wings hits this system of strings from the side while they swing, see the wires, the wires, the wires
And the articulation in our elbows and knees makes us buckle and we couple in endless increase as the audience admires
And the little white dove made with love, made with love made with glue and a glove and some pliers
Swings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark, settle down, settle down my desire

And the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremor
Though no longer bereft, how I shook and I couldn't remember
And then the furthermost shake, drove a murdering stake in and cleft me right down through my center
And I shouldn't say so but I know that it was then or never

Push me back into a tree
Bind my buttons with salt
And fill my long ears with bees
Braying, ""Please, please, please
Oh you ought not, no you ought not""

And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings cut from cardboard and old magazines makes me warble and rise like a sparrow
And in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood, a cord or two, which you chop and you stack in your barrow
And it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood streaked with soot, heavy booted, and wild-eyed
As I crash through the rafters and the ropes and the pulleys trail after and the holiest belfry burns sky high

And then a slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision
While somewhere with your pliers and glue, you make your first incision
And in a moment of almost unbearable vision, doubled over with the hunger of lions
""Hold me close,"" cooed the dove, who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamonds

I wanted to say, ""Why the long face?""
Sparrow perch and play songs of long face
Burro buck and bray songs of long face
Sing, ""I will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long face
And though it may be madness, I will take to the grave your precious long face
And though our bones they may break and our souls separate, why the long face? 
And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil, why the long face?""

And in the trough of the waves
Which are pawing like dogs
Pitch we, pale-faced and grave
As I write in my log

Then I hear a noise from the hull
Seven days out to sea
And it is the damnable bell
And it tolls, well I believe, that it tolls
It tolls for me and it tolls for me

And though my wrists and my waist seem so easy to break still my dear I'd have walked you to the edge of the water
And they will recognize all the lines of your face in the face of the daughter, of the daughter, of my daughter
And darling we will be fine but what was yours and mine appears to me a sandcastle that the gibbering wave takes
But if it's all just the same then will you say my name? Say my name in the morning so that I know when the wave breaks

I wasn't born of a whistle or milked from a thistle at twilight
No, I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright
So enough of this terror we deserve to know light and grow evermore lighter and lighter
You would have seen me through but I could not undo that desire

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh desire, oh

Desire, desire
Desire, desire

From the top of the flight of the wide white stairs
Through the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?",2006
Lilac Wine,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/lilacwine.html,"I lost myself on a cool damp night 
Gave myself in that misty light 
Was hypnotized by a strange delight 
Under a lilac tree 
I made wine from the lilac tree 
Put my heart in its recipe 
It makes me see what I want to see 
and be what I want to be 

When I think more than I want to think 
Do things I never should do 
I drink much more than I ought to drink 
Because I brings me back you... 

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, 
like my love 
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, 
like my love 
Listen to me... 
I cannot see clearly 
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here? 

Lilac wine is sweet and heady 
where's my love? 
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, 
where's my love? 

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy? 
Isn't that he, or am I just going crazy, dear? 
Lilac Wine, I feel unready 
for my love...",2003
Rush Minute,Massive Attack,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/massiveattack/rushminute.html,"I wanna be clean but I gotta get high 
...It's good to be here so hard to come by... 
You bring pain cause you got game... 
And needles and pins a man can't take 

...Peaches living in niches 
...Digging the scene like beautiful cliches 
...From these shapes of a gangster lean 
...Ignoring wars on gasoline 
...Our god's ?? and made to get high 
...God's left hand wasn't made to get by... 
Got more highs left in me 
...And there's more room in recovery... 

From evil ?? that strip all chrome 
...From Marshall Amps into broken homes... 
And borstal blues to countless clicks 
...That rhythm sticks to those classic cheques... 
Steal your tears and drown your fears 
...All is clear in a glass of beer 
...Peaches living in niches... 
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches... 
You fill me with endorphins... 
And you star in magazines... 
We draw liquor from the mattress springs 
...It ain't over til the last bell rings... 
Got more highs you and me... 
And deluxe rooms in recovery",2010
Worn Me Down,Rachael Yamagata,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rachaelyamagata/wornmedown.html,"Gone, she's gone
How do you feel about it
That's what I thought
You're real torn up about it
And I wish you the best
But I could do without it
And I will, because you've worn me down
Oh, I will, because you've worn me down

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please
But you can't stop thinking about her
No, you can't stop thinking about her

And you're wrong, you're wrong
I'm not overreacting
Something is off
Why don't we ever believe ourselves
And I, oh, I feel that word for you
And I will, because you've worn me down
Oh, I will because you have worn me down

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please
But you can't stop thinking about her
No, you can't stop thinking about her

She's so pretty; she's so damn right
But I'm so tired of thinking
About her tonight

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please
But you can't stop thinking about her
No, you can't stop thinking about her

Worn me down like a road

Desperado,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/desperado.html,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now.
Oh, you're a hard one,
But I know that you've got your reasons.
These things, that are pleasin' you,
Can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
She'll beat you if she's able.
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me, some fine things,
Have been laid upon your table.
But you only want the things that you can't get.

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger:
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home.
And freedom, oh, freedom,
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone.

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences and open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
Before it's too late.",2002
Don't Love You,TV on the Radio,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tvontheradio/dontloveyou.html,"Oh simple girl
Oh foolish man
Trying to bend these lovers rules
Into a simple plan 

Oh aching bones on sleepless bed
They toss and turn and roll away
From words unsaid

It's just that all that you were
Was all I could want
Now I can't trust your lover's tongue
Except to tease and taunt

It's been said best by you
Been said best before
But I just want to let you know
I don't love you anymore

Sad wakes alone
Cradling the phone
Knows that sullen silence
Is the meanest way to moan
But all that you were
Was all that I had
And we could not find a simple way
To work that simple plan

Oh aching bones
Oh sleepless bed
Toss, turn and roll
Away from words unsaid
It's been said best by you
Been said best before

But I just want to let you know I don't
Love you anymore

I just want to let you know
I don't love you anymore",2004
Sunshine,Alice in Chains,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/sunshine.html,"One, a-one time, yeah

Am I too contagious
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more
Suck your woman down

Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more
Ain't no day the sun don't crack
Then to brand some name across my back so you care?
Find someone to tell you

Sunshine...sweet love my labor
Don't mind...I don't care no more

Memory, set me free, yeah
I don't care no more

Is my soul entire?

Don't mind...I don't care no more",1990
Annachie Gordon,Loreena McKennitt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loreenamckennitt/annachiegordon.html,"Harking is bonny and there lives my love
My love lies on him and cannot remove
It cannot remove for all that I have done
And I never will forget my love Annachie
For Annachie Gordon he's bonny and he's bright
He'd entice any woman that e'er, e'er he saw
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
And I never will forget my love Annachie

Down came her father, he's standing at the door
Saying Jeannie you are trying the tricks of a whore
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie
For Annachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands
For the Sultan's lands are broad and his towers they run high
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie.

With Annachie Gordon I beg for my bread
Before I marry Sultan his gold to my head
With gold to my head and straight down to my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
And you who are my parents to church you may me bring
But unto Lord Sultan I'll never bear a son
To a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie.

Jeannie was married and from church was brought home
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
She goes into her chamber and cries all alone.

Come to bed my Jeannie my honey and my sweet
To stile you my mistress it would be so sweet
Be it mistress or Jeannie it's all the same to me
But in your bed Lord Sultan I never will lie
And down came her father, he's spoken with renown
Saying you who are her maidens
Come loosen up her gowns
And she fell down to the floor
And straight down to her knee saying
Father look I'm dying for my love Annachie.

The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
And the day that young Annachie came home on the tide
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
Saying oh you've been so long, you've been so long on the sands
So long on the sands, so long upon the floods
They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead.

You who are her maidens come take me by the hand
And lead me to the chamber where my love she lies in
And he kissed her cold lips till his heart it turned to stone
And he died in the chamber that his love she lies in.",1989
Natural Anthem,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/naturalanthem.html,"I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing
It will be a natural anthem, familiar it will seem
It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day

I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places I have taken from real life
So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right...",2003

Shatter,Liz Phair,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lizphair/shatter.html,"I know that I don't always realize
How sleazy it is messing with these guys
But something about just being with you
Slapped me right in the face, nearly broke me in two
It's a mark I've taken heart
And I know I will carry it with me for a long, long time

I don't know if I could drive a car
Fast enough to get to where you are
Or wild enough not to miss the boat completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe
You know, just maybe

I don't know if I could fly a plane
Well enough to tail spin out your name
Or high enough to lose control completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe
You know, just maybe
Maybe",1993
Anyone Else But You,The Moldy Peaches,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moldypeaches/anyoneelsebutyou.html,"You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
Kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swingin' from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So, why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3, DVD, rumble-pack guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, ""b"", ""a"", start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

You are always tryin' to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

We both have shiny, happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan!
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Squinched up your face and did a dance
Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Pigeons and Crumbs,Natalie Imbruglia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natalieimbruglia/pigeonsandcrumbs.html,"Gotta get back
Gotta figure out a way
I'm losing my senses to you
Where'd it go?
The bluebird I should follow back home?
But where is home?

Guess it won't amount to much
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line

Don't believe a thing they say,
Today
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

All alone
But I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking in quicksand tonight
You pick me up
And I shine across the sky
'Til morning, then you color me in

Guess it won't amount to much
Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line

Don't believe a thing they say
Today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way,
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Gotta get it in time
Gotta get it last time

Don't believe a thing they say
Today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way,
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Don't believe a thing they say
Today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way,

Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs",1998
The Dumbing Down Of Love,Frou Frou,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/froufrou/thedumbingdownoflove.html,"Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love

Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without
Without love

No no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
Cause no-one's receiving
This tunnel vision
Is turning out all wrong

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love
Without love
Without love

Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love

Without love
Without love
Yeah, yeah",2002
The Bagman's Gambit,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/thebagmansgambit.html,"On the lam from the law 
On the steps of the capitol 
You shot a plainclothes cop on the ten o'clock 
And I saw momentarily 
They flashed a photograph, it couldn't be you 
You'd been abused so horribly 
But you were there in some anonymous room 
And I recall that fall 
I was working for the government 
And in a bathroom stall off the National Mall 
How we kissed so sweetly 
How could I refuse a favor or two 
For a trist in the greenery 
I gave you documents and microfilm, too 

And from my ten floor tenement 
Where once our bodies lay 
How I long to hear you say 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

It was late one night 
I was awoken by the telephone 
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line 
Purloined in Petrograd 
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay 
So I paid off a bureaucrat 
To convince your captors they're to secret you away 

And at the gate of the embassy 
Our hands met through the bars 
As your whisper stilled my heart 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

And I dreamt one night 
You were there in fours 
Head held high 
In uniform 

It was ten years on 
When you resurfaced in a motorcar 
With the wave of an arm 
You were there and gone",2005
