Sing in Silence,Sonata Arctica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sonataarctica/singinsilence.html,"You were daddy's girl nice and sweet
Never in trouble mommy's honey
Little child who just couldn't see
The pressure from her so called friends
Was simply too much

The monkey slowly climbed on her back
Offering an aid for her pain
Giving love and care
No-one cared, no-one cared...

Fragile like a rose on the snow
Eating all your strength and your money
Walking in the shade day and night
Never letting sunshine in your eyes like before

Cannot shake the monkey off your back
Did I see a spark on your eye
Was it just the last light of hope
That died, hope that died

""Forgive me, Father, my daily sin...""

How can I forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
Haven of Emotion, Mournful Ocean
Heiress of the Evening Sings in silence

""I need to have now, my daily sin...""

For all your life I prayed for time
To show you where the light lies
Now this is the end
One rose for the memory of the innosence...

""I know, my Father, I cannot win...""

Never will forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
How can I erase your pain and aid you
When Death wants to kiss you and you want kiss Him back...",2001
The Needle Has Landed,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/theneedlehaslanded.html,"Here I am in traffic's slow flow
Where the needle touched down
Carbon planes draw a cage round the air force base
Where the needle touched down
My foot on the brake it's ok to fly low
Over poor Spanaway

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter
The needle's the same that recorded and played
When you left me at the greyhound the year I moved away
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here baby
My baby, baby

So that's why I never come back here
That's why they spit out my name
Your ex's have clawed up the bible
Trying to keep me away
With the sledge of tectonic fever
The needle has landed again
Let it play

And the needle touched down
The needle is landing
And the needle touched down
The needle is landing

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town
From a sharp-toothed freighter
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here",2006
The Jeep Song,The Dresden Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dresdendolls/thejeepsong.html,"I've been driving around town 
With my head spinning around
Everywhere i look i see
Your '96 jeep cherokee

You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that ive been through
You'd think i'd hate the sight of you

But with every jeep i see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess its just my stupid luck
That all of boston drives that same black fucking truck

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style...

I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When i wonder if it makes you want to cry 
Every time you see a light blue volvo driving by

So dont tell me that you're off to see the world
I know you wont get very far
Dont call me if you get another girl baby
Just call me if you get another car

The number of them is insane
Every exit's an exboyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and i want to paint it black

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
I can't wait til you trade that fucker in
By then they will have stuck me in the looney bin

It could be him my heart is pounding
Its just no use i'm surrounded
But someday i'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that cherokee straight off this trail of tears",2004
You Had Time,Ani DiFranco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anidifranco/youhadtime.html,"how can I go home
with nothing to say
I know you're going to look at me that way
and say what did you do out there
and what did you decide
you said you needed time
and you had time

you are a china shop
and I am a bull
you are really good food
and I am full
I guess everything is timing
I guess everything's been said
so I am coming home with an empty head

you'll say did they love you or what
I'll say they love what I do
the only one who really loves me is you
and you'll say girl did you kick some butt
and I'll say I don't really remember
but my fingers are sore
and my voice is too

you'll say it's really good to see you
you'll say I missed you horribly
you'll say let me carry that
give that to me
and you will take the heavy stuff
and you will drive the car
and I'll look out the window making jokes
about the way things are

how can I go home
with nothing to say
I know you're going to look at me that way
and say what did you do out there
and what did you decide
you said you needed time
and you had time",1994
Joining You,Alanis Morissette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/joiningyou.html,"dear dar(lin') your mom (my friend) left a message on my machine she was frantic
saying you were talking crazy that you wanted to do away with yourself
I guess she thought i'd be a perfect resort because we've had 
this inexplicable connection since our youth and yes they're in shock 
they are panicked you and your chronic them and their drama
you this embarrassment us in the middle of this delusion
if we were our bodies
if we were our futures
if we were our defenses i'd be joining you
if we were our culture
if we were our leaders
if we were our denials i'd be joining you
I remember vividly a day years ago we were camping you knew more than you thought you should know
you said ""I don't want ever to be brainwashed"" and you were mindboggling you were intense
you were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful
if we were our nametags
if we were our rejections
if we were our outcomes i'd be joining you
if we were our indignities
if we were our successes
if we were our emotions i'd be joining you
you and I we're like 4 year olds we want to know why and how come about everything
we want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds and never talk small and be intuitive
and question mightily and find god my tortured beacon
we need to find like-minded companions
if we were their condemnations
if we were their projections
if we were our paranoias i'd be joining you
if we were our incomes
if we were our obsession
if we were our afflictions i'd be joining you
we need reflection we need a really good memory feel free to call me a little more often",1998
The World Is Black,Good Charlotte,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goodcharlotte/theworldisblack.html,"Turn on channel seven at a quarter to eight
You see the same damn thing it's just a different day and
No one really knows why this is happening
But it's happening
And everywhere you go it's just a different place
You get the same dark feeling
See the same sad faces
No one really cares that this is happening

We come into this world
And we all are the same
In that moment there's no one to blame

But the world is black
And hearts are cold
And there's no hope
That's what we're told
And we can't go back
It won't be the same
Forever changed
By the things we've seen, seen

Living in this place it's always been this way
There's no one doing nothing so there's nothing changed
And I can't live when this world just keeps dying
It's dying
People always tell me this is part of the plan
That God's got everybody in His hands
But I can only pray that God is listening
Is He listening?

We're living in this world
Growing colder everyday
Nothing can stay perfect now I see

But the world is black
And hearts are cold
And there's no hope
That's what we're told
And we can't go back
It won't be the same

If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next,Manic Street Preachers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/manicstreetpreachers/ifyoutoleratethisyourchildrenwillbenext.html,"The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young and being so vain

Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked La Ramblas
But not with real intent

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next

A Design for Life,Manic Street Preachers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/manicstreetpreachers/adesignforlife.html,"Libraries gave us power
Then work came and made us free
What price now for a shallow piece of dignity

I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my dirty face to wear the scars 
To show from where I came

We don't talk about love we only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end

Going To A Town,Rufus Wainwright,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rufuswainwright/goingtoatown.html,"I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America

I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead

Tell me, do you really think you go to hell for having loved?
Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you've done is good
I really need to know, after soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America

I really need to know
I may just never see you again, or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead
I got a soul to feed
I got a dream to heed
And that's all I need

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I'm going to a town
That has already been burnt down",2007
Have I Told You Lately,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/haveitoldyoulately.html,"Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Oh the morning sun in all its glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
And you fill my life with laughter
You can make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
And it shines like the sun
At the end of the day we will give thanks
And pray to the One

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Fill my life with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do.",1989
New York Minute,Don Henley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donhenley/newyorkminute.html,"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here;
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
You can get out of the rain
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute",1989
You Don't Know,Milow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/milow/youdontknow.html,"sometimes everything seems awkward and large
imagine a Wednesday evening in March
future and past at the same time
I make use of the night and start drinking a lot
although not ideal for now it's all that I've got
it's nice to know your name

You don't know you don't know
you don't know anything bout' me

an ocean a lake I need a place to drown
let's freeze the moment because we're going down
tomorrow you'll be gone, gone, gone
you're laughing too hard this all seems surreal
I feel peculiar now what do you feel
do you think there's a chance that we can fall

you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
what do I know I know your name
you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me anymore

I gave up dreaming for a while
I gave up dreaming for a while

I've noticed these are mysterious days
I look at it like a jigsaw puzzle and gaze
with wide open mouth and burning eyes
if only I could start to care
my dreams and my Wednesdays ain't going nowhere
baby baby baby you don't know 

you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
what do I know I know your name
you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me",2006

Around around around around around
Around around around around around
Around around around around around)

You took your time to come back this time
The grass has grown under your feet
In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said there'd be no one else
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I've burned out cupid's arrow
And here's the short and the narrow
I've nothing left to offer you

I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing

It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving me around

You Have Been Loved,George Michael,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgemichael/youhavebeenloved.html,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world
We've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If i was weak, forgive me
But i was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And i'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove

And heaven help the ones who wait for you

Well i've no daughters, i've no sons
Guess i'm the only one
Living in my life

Take care my love, he said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, he said

You have been loved",1996
Stop,Sam Brown,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sambrown/stop.html,"All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you ever worry that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Stop if love me
(you will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(that day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop",1988

There Goes The Fear,Doves,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/doves/theregoesthefear.html,"Out of here
We're out of here
Along with fear
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

And cars speed fast
Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love
to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify
You turned around and life's
passed you by
Passed you by, again

And late last night
Makes up her mind
Another fight
Left behind
There goes the fear again, let it go
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's
passed you by
You look to ones you love
to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify, why?
You turned around and life's
passed you by

Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when he's calling out
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today

There goes the fear again, let it go
There goes the fear, let it go

Take It Easy (Love Nothing),Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/takeiteasylovenothing.html,"First with your hands and then with your mouth
A downpour of sweat, damp cotton clouds
I was a fool, you were my friend
We made it happen
You took off your clothes, left on the light
You stood there so brave
You used to be shy
Each feature improved, each movement refined and eyes like a showroom
Now they are spreading out the blankets on the beach
That weatherman is a liar
He said it would be raining but it's clear and blue as far as I can see

Left by the lamp, right next to the bed, 
On a cartoon cat pad she scratched with a pen,
""Everything is as it's always been. 
This never happened.
Don't take it too bad it is nothing you did.
It's just once something dies you can't make it live.
You're a beautiful boy.
You're a sweet little kid but I am a woman.""
So I laid back down and wrapped myself up in the sheet
And I must have looked like a ghost 'cause something frightened me
And since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
And a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I'll try and be kind when I ask you to leave
We'll both take it easy
But if you stay too long inside my memory,
I will trap you in a song tied to a melody
And I will keep you there so you can't bother me",2005

Inside of Love,Nada Surf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nadasurf/insideoflove.html,"Watching terrible TV
It kills all thought
Getting spacier than
An astronaut
Making out with people
I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do
Late at night

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above

Only when we get to see
The aerial view
Will the patterns show
We'll know what to do
I know the last page so well
I can't read the first
So I just don't start
It's getting worse

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I can't find my way in
I try again and again

[Bridge:]
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
Must be a different view
To be a me with a you

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
Of course I'll be alright
I just had a bad night
I had a bad night",2002

It's easy to see, it's easy to see

It's easy to feel, it's easy to feel
But it's not good enough, even though it's real

Oh, please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
Oh, please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray

It's easy to breathe, it's easy to grieve
To breathe only air where life should be
It's easy to laugh, it's easy to cry
To cry so so hard that it can't be denied

Oh, please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
Oh, please stay awake

Da da da da da,

I don't know if I can yell any louder,
How many times have I kicked you out of here
Or said something insulting?

I can be so mean when I wanna be,
I am capable of really anything,
I can cut you into pieces,
When my heart is broken.

Please, don't leave me [2x]
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty.
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest.
But baby I don't mean it,
I mean it, I promise

And I need you.

Lately,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/lately.html,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye",1980

Don't leave me out in the rain

Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life

Bring back the joy to my life

And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Found Out About You,Gin Blossoms,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ginblossoms/foundoutaboutyou.html,"All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

I found about you",1989
The Way Things Are,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/thewaythingsare.html,"I wouldn't know what to do with another chance
If you gave it to me
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance
It's race right through me
I'm much better off the way things are
Much much better if, better by far, by far
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice
It'd roll right past me
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice
So don't even ask me
I'm much better off, the way things are
Much much better off, better by far
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be
Able to move on
How can I fight, when we're on the same side
How can I fight beside you
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
Ans I'll keep on kicking the crap will it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be

Marquee Moon,Television,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/television/marqueemoon.html,"I remember how the darkness doubled
I recall lightnin' struck itself
I was listenin', listenin' to the rain
I was hearing, hearing something else

Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
Just waiting

I spoke to a man down at the tracks
And I asked him how he don't go mad
He said ""Look here junior, don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad""

Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
Hesitating

Well a Cadillac, it pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me, all they said ""get in"" (""get in"")
Then the Cadillac, it puttered back into the graveyard
Me, I got out again

Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
I ain't waiting, uh-uh

I remember how the darkness doubled
I recall lightning struck itself
I was listening, listening to the rain
I was hearing, hearing something else",1977
You've Got Her in Your Pocket,The White Stripes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/youvegotherinyourpocket.html,"You've got her in your pocket
And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's at home sweet home

Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
Then she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun

But now she might leave
Like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her

But now you're scared
You think she's running away
You search in your head for something clever to say
Don't go away
'Cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home, home sweet home",2003
Life 2: The Unhappy Ending,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/life2theunhappyending.html,"[Scene one:] Late at night interior, we find ourselves inside the car
Our hero has just gone too far, his lover bleeding in the back
He removes the Lucky from the pack, he knows now that he can't turn back

[Cut to:] The cherry lights in the rearview
He realizes that he's through
Whispers, ""Darling let's have fun""
Hits the exit doing 91, drives until he's in the woods
If he loses them he's gone for good

Life was supposed to be a film, was supposed to be a thriller, was supposed to end in tears
But life, could be nothing but a joke, could be nothing but a con
Where's my unhappy ending gone?
Life was supposed to be a film, was supposed to be a thriller, was supposed to end in blood
But life could be nothing but a joke, a sentimental con
Where's my unhappy ending gone? Where's my unhappy ending gone?

[Her:] Here is the part where you save me, here is the scene where you save the day
Why can't the ending be happy?
Why must it always resolve this way?

[Fade in:] A cabin in the woods somewhere
Our hero strokes his lover's hair
Says ""Don't worry love we're almost done""
Says ""I could have really been someone""
Outside, they surround the house with pistols drawn
It's a waiting game until dawn
Sergeant says ""He can't go on, we know now that he can't go on...""

Life was supposed to be a film, was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in fire
But life turns out it's nothing but a dream
And that I'll miss it when it's gone
I want the story to go on and on but it can't go on...",2007
Woman King,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/womanking.html,"Blackbird claw, raven wing
Under the red sunlight
Long clothesline, two shirtsleeves
Waving as we go by

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, wristwatch time
Slowing as she goes to sleep

Black horse fly, lemonade
Jar on the red ant hill
Garden worm, cigarette
Ash on the window sill

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, sword in hand
Swing at some evil and bleed

Black hoof mare, broken leg
Eye on the shotgun shell
Age old dog, hornet nest
Built in the big church bell

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, bloodshot eye
Thumb down and starting to weep",P:  
Cinder and Smoke,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/cinderandsmoke.html,"Give me your hand 
The dog in the garden row is covered in mud 
And dragging your mother's clothes 
Cinder and smoke 
The snake in the basement 
Found the juniper shade 
The farmhouse is burning down 

Give me your hand 
And take what you will tonight, I'll give it as fast 
And high as the flame will rise 
Cinder and smoke 
Some whispers around the trees 
The juniper bends 
As if you were listening 

Give me your hand

You'll ask it to burn again",2004

Will speak to me 
A bird's wing on the window

Her fever dream 
A language on her face 

I want your flowers like babies want God's love 
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come

Some days, like rain on the doorstep 
She'll cover me 
With grace in all she offers 
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her 
What honest words 
She can't afford to say, like 

I want your flowers like babies want God's love 
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come",2004
Passing Afternoon,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/passingafternoon.html,"There are times that walk from you like some passing afternoon 
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon 
And she chose a yard to burn but the ground remembers her 
Wooden spoons, her children stir her Bougainvillea blooms 

There are things that drift away like our endless, numbered days 
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made 
And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings 
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves 

There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass 
Springtime calls her children 'till she let's them go at last 
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring 
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds 

There are things we can't recall, blind as night that finds us all 
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls 
But my hands remember hers, rolling 'round the shaded ferns 
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned 

There are names across the sea, only now I do believe 
Sometimes, with the windows closed, she'll sit and think of me 
But she'll mend his tattered clothes and they'll kiss as if they know 
A baby sleeps in all our bones, so scared to be alone",2004
The Celibate Life,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/thecelibatelife.html,"The dust from a four-day affair is now landing
All over the floor and your brown legs
The gold plated legs of my rival
Whose eyes had no reason to fall

You led no celibate life no skirt while chemicals danced on your head
You stole the keys to this ride and your fables are falling tonight

Because of your struggle to make them
Their taste for your past time is fading
Remember the girls in the middle are always the first to fall off

You'll learn to live like a mouse
Searching the cracks in the floor to remember
All the dregs in the crowd you barely recall

You led no celibate life no skirt while chemicals danced on your head
You stole the keys to this ride and your fables are falling tonight",2001
Tonight,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/tonight.html,"Come around and say you love me

I'll watch you from the corner
Telephones and old typewriters
Words of love along the wires
Let's make it work tonight
Telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
Let's make it work tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Then furious you threw the picture
I cap in hand, an awful mixture
That kind of hard love is the worst
I try to speak
But you don't hear me
When you're gone
You still feel near me
For awhile
For a little while
I try telephones and old typewriters
Words of love along the wires
But nothing is working tonight
I try telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
But nothing is working tonight

Please let's make it work tonight

Carousel,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/carousel.html,"Almost home
When I missed the bottom stair
You were braiding your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone

And the perfect girls
By the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know about the hive and the honey bees

Almost home
With an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on a TV stand

And the cruel wind blew
Every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes

Almost home
We got lost on our new street
While your grieving girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

And the cops couldn't care
When that crackhead built a boat
And said, ""Please, before I go
May our only honored bone
Be the kinship of the kids and the riot squad""",2007

Would you just wait as Iâm drifting off?
And if I never saw you again, could I, put all, of this, aside

She's Falling Apart,Lisa Loeb,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lisaloeb/shesfallingapart.html,"They pull up their chairs to the table
She stares at the food on her plate
At the toast and the butter
Her father and mother, she pushes away

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

She gets home from school too early
And closes the door to her room
There's nothing inside her
She's weak and she's tired of feeling like this

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

They call her for dinner, she makes up a reason
She looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves
And her mother is starting to see through her lies
And last night her father had tears in his eyes

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

And we rise in the morning
And we sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart",2002
At Least I'm Not as Sad (as I Used to Be),fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/atleastimnotassadasiusedtobe.html,"Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

Câmon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, at least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, itâs been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You shouldâve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

Câmon can you count all the loves that didnât last?
Itâs such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said we wouldâve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youthâs taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing....

So I left, that is it. Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât keep friends, I keep acquainted,
Iâm not a prophet, but Iâm here to profit.

Thatâs all, Iâm gone! Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.

to spend my money

You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me
you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her 
(I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair",1973

After the Gold Rush,k.d. lang,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kdlang/afterthegoldrush.html,"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights 
In armor coming, 
Saying something about a queen. 
There were peasants singing and 
Drummers drumming 
And the archer split the tree. 
There was a fanfare blowing 
To the sun 
That was floating on the breeze. 
Look at Mother Nature on the run 
In the nineteen seventies. 
Look at Mother Nature on the run 
In the nineteen seventies. 

I was lying in a burned out basement 
With the full moon in my eyes. 
I was hoping for replacement 
When the sun burst thru the sky. 
There was a band playing in my head 
And I felt like getting high. 
I was thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 
Thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver 
Space ships flying 
In the yellow haze of the sun, 
There were children crying 
And colors flying 
All around the chosen ones. 
All in a dream, all in a dream 
The loading had begun. 
They were flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home in the sun. 
Flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home.",2004
The Other Side,Morphine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morphine/theotherside.html,"I'm going down to the river
There's a man I wanna see
Yeah, he's the ferryman
He'll recognize me

I'm going down now to the riverside
There's a place I wanna be
I'm going to talk to the ferryman
He'll be expecting me

I'm crossing over now to the other side

Life is better there on the other side
The grass is greener there on the other side
And I, I get even there on the other side
And everything will turn out all right on the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
The other sideâ¦

I walked by the church house late last night
Yeah, I walked by the church house, but I didn't go inside
'Cause I, I once slept with the preacher's wife
She handed me a ticket to the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
To the other sideâ¦",1992
Killing Game,Skinny Puppy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/skinnypuppy/killinggame.html,"Fallen angel head crashes dead out of control 
Lost memories staircase twists 
Darker rooms lit with left out toys 
After playing mean changes toys into tools
Twisted playthings on the staircase fools
Fools weapons represents the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Awaken eyes sewn wearing glasses dripping tap tap temple door
Locked inside scream inner scraping tooth and nail nowhere to go 
Quiet retraces forcing light tears then pretend nothing blinds 
Blinds closed in sanctuary closed in sanctuary 
Padded walls not quiet storm's fury burnt out killing time 
Who taught the killing game 
Time's taught the killing game herself 
No I taught the killing game first 
Passing words distant pain remember trains of thought collide
No one view window 
Pushing faces through shards cold glass poke bloody holes exposed 
I taught the killing game first 
I taught the killing game first 
Tongue lash spewing red 
tortured animal 
wake up time 
Beckons death upon myself 
eyes travelled harden 
Strange no stronger feeling
Tempting motion slows to a crawl 
Places his weaponry in its own trap 
Let go the springs snap shut 
Crazy sharper teeth 
giving in to the jaws of death 
I taught the killing game 
I taught the killing game first 
I taught I taught I taught the game first",1992
I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/imsolonesomeicouldcry.html,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.",1960
Free Man In Paris,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/freemaninparis.html,"The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es 
Going cafÃ© to cabaret
Thinking how I'd feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery
Behind the popular song",1974
Beautiful Boyz,CocoRosie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cocorosie/beautifulboyz.html,"No more of those beautiful boys
No more of those beautiful boys

Born illegitimately to a whore most likely
He became an orphan
Oh, what a lovely orphan
He was sent to the reformatory
Ten years old, it was his first glory
Got caught stealing from a nun
Now his love story had begun

Thirty years he spent wandering
A devil's child with dove wings
Oh, he went to prison
In every country he set foot in
Oh, how he loved - he loved prison
How awfully lovely was prison

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

His greatest love was executed
The pure romance was undisputed
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

Bird On A Wire,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/birdonawire.html,"Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free 
Like a fish on a hook 
Like a knight from an old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons with thee

And if I have been unkind 
I hope that you will just let it go by 
And if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn 
Like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song 
By all I have done wrong 
I'll make it all up to you

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch 
He called out to me ""Don't ask for so much"" 
And a young man leaning on his darkened door 
He cried out to me ""Hey, why not ask for more""

Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free",1994
Far More,The Honorary Title,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/honorarytitle/farmore.html,"Is this the sound of our demise
Or is it just the opposite?
I love you and I miss you
What else is there to say?
It takes a hell of a lot more to complete this

Far more, far more to recreate
Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we can take

When you decide how much time
Do you let, do you let, do you let, do you let
Pass before
These false starts, these small meals
They're for my, for my starving hands
Just treading, just treading shallow waters
Avoiding the drop, the drop in the ocean floor

Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we possess
How much, how much, how much
How much longer, girl
How much longer do we need to wait?

For a moment when the blare of the TV subsides
And that song fills the air, replaying every night
A change in the key feels like a change in the season

I pretend almost every, every other night
That this body and its entirety belongs to me, every breath
It comes and goes
It comes and goes
All night

Well, you can't dictate the way, the way I'm gonna feel
No matter what, no matter what I'm forced to see
I'll be the one free of jealousy

Well, you can't dictate the way, the way I'm gonna feel
No matter what, no matter what I'm forced to see
I'll be the one free of jealousy

Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we can take
So well, so well, so well rehearsed
At coordinating this kind of mess

I'll do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like we used to
Like we used to do

Satisfied Mind,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/satisfiedmind.html,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had money, I would do things my way,""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

One thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind,
Satisfied mind.",1998

Dinner At Eight,Rufus Wainwright,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rufuswainwright/dinnerateight.html,"No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me

Dinner at eight was okay
Before the toast full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again

Why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When it fact you were the one long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You left me

So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives

But 'til then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me

No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me",2003
Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/bowloforanges.html,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002
Southern Anthem,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/southernanthem.html,"Just like the way that you ran to wine
When they made the new milk turn
Jesus a friend in the better times
Let your mother's Bible burn
Freedom a fever you suffered through
And the dog drank from your cup
Frozen the river that baptized you
And the horse died standing up

But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down

Just like the way that you lost your guns
When they cut the clothesline loose
Jesus a friend of the weaker ones
Said ""I'm all they stole from you""
Freedom a thistle that withered dry
Still a baby in your hands
Frozen the ground refused to die
And the guitar rose again

But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down",2002

We could do it, it's right romantically [3x]

The Saddest Story Ever Told,The Magnetic Fields,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/magneticfields/thesaddeststoryevertold.html,"We used to go out on the summer nights and dance in the neon rain 
We used to hold hands at the movie show but we'll never hold hands again
Do do do do do come on 
Do do do do do come on 
[Chorus:]
Those days are gone You and I were young those summer nights 
You'll see the world diving for a girl you'll never find 
and then we'll quietly grow old: the saddest story ever told. 
Once upon a time we fell in love or at least that's what you said 
You say I can find someone else but I just wish I was dead

Do do do do do come on.

After laughter, comes tears

[Verse One: The RZA]

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh HA
Not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's alway the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer]

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin out
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff 
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

Crazy me don't think there's pain in barcelona
They dance you round a waltz confound
But i fear it's a long way down
This road
Even if that straw i pulled
And i got to fight that bull
Nothing really does compare to barcelona
Besides in spain don juan's to blame
But i fear it's a long way down
And i fear i won't be around

Laying out my summer clothes
Search for traps in vain like scratching
So my suitcase i can close

Coles Corner,Richard Hawley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardhawley/colescorner.html,"Hold back the night from us,
Cherish the light for us,
Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn.

Cold city lights glowing,
The traffic of life is flowing,
Out over the rivers and on into dark.

I'm going down town where there's music,
I'm going where voices fill the air,
Maybe there's someone waiting for me
With a smile and a flower in her hair

I'm going down town where there's people
The loneliness hangs in the air.
With no-one there real waiting for me,
No smile, no flower nowhere.

Cold city

Hold back

Hold back the night",2005

Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them

But it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning...",1997

And i love its golden glow
It's the little head inside your little hole
And out spring some sparkling thoughts

Still love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better

It's like finding home
In an old folk song
That you've never ever heard
Still you know every word
And for sure you can sing along

Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better

Have You Seen Her,The Chi-Lites,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chilites/haveyouseenher.html,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But to me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh why
Did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby, I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why oh why?
Did you have to leave and go away? Oh yeah
Ooh oh, I've been used to having someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know
I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny
But I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Have you seen her
Tell me, have you seen her (tell me, have you seen her?)

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?",1971
These Are the Fables,The New Pornographers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newpornographers/thesearethefables.html,"In coral and gray
In submarine chambers
One day
It swam for the light
The jewels that lit
The cities that float there
Cities in circles drawn perfect, complete
Holding the secrets on my street
My street, my street

So come in and play
The song of the siren
It's commonplace
You hear the voice rise
In one wave
And crash on your doorstep
Making the circle here perfect, complete
These are the fables on my street

Ten thousand dancing girls
Kicking cans 'cross the sky
No reason why
Why ask to pay yourself
For the call of the wild
You found this child
So raise him

And wind your back
Come back to the river
The currents speed by
And hope the men fear
The hammer comes down
So hard on the evening
Cracking the dawn of your
Days are repeat
These are fables on my street
My street, my street

Heaven shook Hell
And down from its pockets
The ring in your bell
It fell through your hands
Hang at your feet
The doors that won't open
Marking the journey of our friends complete
These are the fables of my street
My street

My street, my street
Lay down in glory, you're not alone

My street, my street
Lay down in glory, you're not alone",2005
The Animals of the World,Great Lake Swimmers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatlakeswimmers/theanimalsoftheworld.html,"Watching the night animals
bellying close to the ground
I was walking in the dark
It was following some feral scent
Like I was crossing the road
Like I was
Following those streets to their destinations

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end we all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the winds
Biding the tides
Riding the winds
Or biding the tides

Flying with the sun
Or perched in a row
I was at a window sill
They were unaware like I was
A moment there and then gone
Like I was
Looking for a place to rest

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end
We all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the wheels
Biding the streets
Riding the wheels
Or biding the streets",2003
Fly,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/fly.html,"Please give me a second grace,
Please give me a second face,
I've fallen far down, the first time around, 
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly

Please tell me your second name, 
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are, 
I just need your star for a day

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny, 
For it's really too hard for the fly",1970
Maybe Sparrow,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/maybesparrow.html,"Maybe sparrow you should wait
The hawks alight till morning
You'll never pass beyond the gate

Notes are hung so effortless
With the rise and fall of sparrow's breast
It's a drowning dive and back to the chorus

La di da di da di da
La di da di da di da

Oh my sparrow it's too late
Your body limp beneath my feet
Your dusty eyes cold as clay
You didn't hear my warning

Maybe sparrow it's too late
Moonlight glanced off metal wings
In a thunderstorm above the clouds
The engine hums a sparrow's phrase
For those who cannot hear the words
For those who will not hear the words
For those who will not hear the words

Won't you tell your dad get off my back?
Tell him what we said 'bout Paint It Black
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh

Look at the ghost you've made of me'

Dusk dropped her starry gown
I whispered out
""Sweetie, are you here with me?""

Red Berries,Angus & Julia Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/angusjuliastone/redberries.html,"I ate the red berries
And fell into the pond
I found myself in a dream
Where all my worries were gone

So I swam up to the top
And strolled up into a land
If people aren't who they're not
I thought wouldn't that be grand?
Wouldn't that be grand?

Birds don't whistle, they just sing
Birds don't whistle, they just sing
Things just start as they sing
Birds don't whistle, they just sing

They sung this song

I ate the red berries
The ones you told to leave alone
On the devil's shoulder I leaned
As I fell through the clouds like a storm

So I climbed up to the top
And jumped off into a land
If people aren't who they're not
I thought wouldn't that be grand?
Wouldn't that be grand?

Confessions,Peter Murphy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petermurphy/confessions.html,"I could use your gullibility
Distort the painful truth
Present a fear and laugh at you
Leave you lost unsure removed
The must I feel to put it right
Put an end to naive faith
In slick successes avenue
The vacuum of save face

Direct words can turn lost minds
Towards some monster seed
Lyrics sung from pretty looks
Can on the reader feed
Be strong to check and recognise
The pretty face is all
But being used to sell you songs
That never say it all

The incident meets the senses
The illusions in a mask
The sun of a summer afternoon
Docility rocks the mask
Broken loose from moorings
In a flash the swell had passed
Towards the beach with unabated speed
Confessions of a mask",1986

Prison Girls,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/prisongirls.html,"Where am I tonight? La, da, da 
My hotel room won't remember me 
And this dream will die, die by morning 
And this dream won't remember me 

Awakened by a droning voice 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
Is it a lady or is it a man 
Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

On my feet to chase it down 
The lights were spokes and rungs away 
I stumbled back and hit the floor 
Long shadows crawl beneath the door 
To a passage so poorly lit 
There's moths flying away from it 

Who am I tonight? La, da, da 
My hotel room won't remember me 
Darkness enter prison girls 
Pushing mops and kicking pails 
Now's my chance 
I clasp my chest 
And declare unto my audience 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

Prison girls are not impressed 
They're the ones that have to clean this mess 
They've traded more for cigarettes 
Than I've managed to express 

Filing past miles long 
The cheek is frozen to the floor 
The prison girls have filled their beds 
Their thoughts too dry above their heads 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes",2009

Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me
I have no reason to smile
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

But like a queen with her king

Roses Blue,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/rosesblue.html,"I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to",1969
Dear Chicago,Ryan Adams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ryanadams/dearchicago.html,"Dear Chicago, 
You'll never guess. 
You know the girl you said I'd meet someday? 
Well, I've got something to confess. 
She picked me up on Friday. 
Asked me if she reminded me of you. 
I just laughed and lit a cigarette, 
Said ""that's impossible to do."" 
My life's gotten simple since. 
And it fluctuates so much. 
Happy and sad and back again. 
I'm not crying out to much. 
Think about you all the time. 
It's strange and hard to deal. 
Think about you lying there. 
And those blankets lie so still. 
Nothing breathes here in the cold. 
Nothing moves or even smiles. 
I've been thinking some of suicide. 
But there's bars out here for miles. 
Sorry about the every kiss. 
Every kiss you wasted (bad / back)
I think the thing you said was true, 
I'm going to die alone and sad. 

The wind's feeling real these days. 
Yeah, baby, it hurt's me some. 
Never thought I'd feel so blue. 
New York City, you're almost gone. 
I think that I've fallen out of love, 
I think I've fallen out of love . . . with you.",2002

Hanging on the edge of a lie

With the sounds it makes you won't hear it if I call
I let go
I let go

There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves so I choose to sink

Your skin protected me from sunbeams
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
I let go
I let go

You were always there to walk me home
With you not here, the streets I roam
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves as I choose to sink
With your voice in my head
I would float here instead
But there's a calm under the waves
So I choose to sink

I'm tired now
I'll see you when I wake up
I've heard it's pretty where you are

Then I have to tell you
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.

This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.

I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.
Everyone hates a sad professor.

Suicide Underground,Air,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/air/suicideunderground.html,"Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood 
from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped out elms,
and the harsh sunlight. 

Some thought the tortures tearing the Lisbon girls
pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world 
as it was handed down to them.
So full of flaws.

But the only thing we are certain of 
after all these years,
is the insufficiency of explanation.
(Obviously, doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl.)

The Lisbon girls were
13 - Cecilia
14 - Lux
15 - Bonnie
16 - Mary 
and 17 - Therese.

No one could understand how 
Mrs Lisbon and Mr Lisbon, 
our math teacher, 
had produced such beautiful creatures.

From that time on
The Lisbon house began to change.
Almost everyday
and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on a towel,
wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife sharpener
to give her a 15 minute demonstration for free.

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
was Trip Fontaine.
Who only 18 months before the suicides,
had emerged from baby fat, 
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
and Mrs Lisbon shut the house in maximum security isolation.

The girls' only contact with the outside world
was through the catalogs they ordered,
that started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
with pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.

Unable to go anywhere,
the girls traveled in their imaginations.
To gold tipped Siamese temples, or past an old man with a leaf broom,
tiding a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

And Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

Collecting everything we could of theirs,
we couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds.
But they were slipping away.
The colours of their eyes were fading
along with exact locations of moles and dimples.

From 5 they had become 4,
and they were all, the living and the dead,
becoming shadows. 

We would have lost them completely 
if the girls hadn't contacted us.

Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house we had forgot to stop at the garage.

After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr Hedly pack up the house,
selling what furniture he could in a garage sale.

Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
and they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.

We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been.
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them.
And they hadn't heard us calling..still do not hear us,
calling them out of those rooms.
Where they went to be alone for all time.

Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper then death.
And where we will never find the pieces,
to put them back together.",
Peeping Tom,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/peepingtom.html,"I'm careful not to fall
I have to climb your wall
'Cause you're the one
Who makes me feel much taller than you are 
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose 

I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared 

The face that fills the hole
That stole my broken soul
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are

On my own for far too long
Troubles with the gear
Nothing left to fear 

I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared

With every bet I lost
And every trick I tossed
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose

Up on the Ladder,Radiohead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiohead/upontheladder.html,"I'm stuck in the TARDIS
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a lie
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder
We're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder
We wait for your mistake

Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same",2007

Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever

This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here like it's over

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now

Let's leave forever",2007
156,Mew,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mew/156.html,"From my boat I can see your house
And when the lights are on
I can watch you move
Hear the wind whispering your name
Twice the encouragement
Of the real you
Callie if you really want me to
I can always get you down
If you got the money for me
Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Making amends for distant wrong
Sincere
You can run away
Leave your books behind you
But you should look back twice
Just to be on the safe side
From my boat I can see your house
But now the lights are off
And there is no one home
You are just like an avalanche
Cold as I might have guessed
But at least I'm covered up for now
In a big, big way
I am really small
I get off my feet
But I'm still distant
Don't you just love goodbyes?
Callie let us get it over with
I can always get you down
If you got the money for me
Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Most of our lives we try so hard
To find the time
I won't care for you
Like I'm really supposed to
There are things I'll do
That could really hurt you
Don't you just love goodbyes?

Can't find your way,
Push a hand up to the sky.

To be by your side,
Dont you ever bat an eye.

Lining the roadside,
Try to glimpse at the dead.

We don't do anything
We didn't do the day
Before you go
You oughta know 
That I didn't mean to hurt you, I just wanted you to know

And I am wrong
Black tears are falling and she won't say what I've done
She's sitting here beside me, then she is gone
Black tears are falling, falling

Remember long ago
Together laughing, loving
Oh so long ago
When we were buying something
Life was simple then
But she's not happy now, and I
Don't feel anything
Her lips are moving
I am mesmerised 
By tiny lies
I'm watching as the shapes are drawing slowly from her eyes

Black tears are falling down her face
And I am wrong
Black tears are falling and she won't say what I've done
She's sitting here beside me, then she is gone
Black tears are falling, falling
Black tears are falling, falling

Promises deceived

A kiss ""Goodnight"" from every 
Stranger that I meet

Brought you here, to me

Accept this love 

Friendship battered down by 
Useless history 
Unexamined failure 

But what am I still to you 
Some thief who stole from you? 
Or, some fool drama queen 
Whose chances were few? 

That brings us to who we need 
A place where we can save 
A heart that beats as 
Both siphon and reservoir 

You're a woman, I'm a calf 
You're a window, I'm a knife 
We come together 
Making chance in the starlight 

Meet me tomorrow night 
Or any day you want 
I have no right to wonder 
Just how, or when 

You know the meaning fits 
There's no relief in this 
I miss my beautiful friend 

I have to send it away 
To bring her back again.",1998

Banging on the walls of your intoxicated mind
Do you ever wonder why you were left alone
As your heart grew colder and finally turned to stone

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

Pathetic oblivion
Forgotten hopes buried in your soul's lonely grave
Pathetic oblivion
Remember how you were before you locked your heart away

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

And round her the night turns
Round her the night turns...

Drawn too close and gone in a flash
Just a few bruises in the region of the splash...

Into the Ocean,Blue October,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blueoctober/intotheocean.html,"I'm just a normal boy
That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore

Without a life vest I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim
Like fourteen miles away

Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be

I wanna swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion... yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Goodbye
Let the rain come down
Goodbye [repeat]

Where is the coastguard
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
How can I keep up this breathing

Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

I wanna swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion... yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow (yeah)
Just to prove that I knew how (yeah)
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall

Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

[Zayra]
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)

I wanna swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion (yeah)
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
(In to space)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/dayisdone.html,"When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.",1969
Baloney Again,Mark Knopfler,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markknopfler/baloneyagain.html,"We don't eat in no white restaurants
We're eatin' in the car
Baloney again, baloney again
We don't sleep in no white hotel bed
We're sleeping in the car, baloney again
You don't strut around in this country towns
You best stay in the car
Look on ahead don't stare around
You best stay where you are
You're a long way from home, boy
Don't push your luck too far
Baloney again

Twenty-two years we've sung the word
Since nineteen thirty-one
Amen, I say amen
Now the young folk want to praise the lord
With guitar, bass and drums, amen
Well I'll never get tired of Jesus
But it's been a heavy load
Carrying His precious love
Down a long dirt road
We're a long way from home
Just let's pay the man and go
Baloney again

The Lord is my shepherd
He leadeth me in pastures green
He gave us this day
Our daily bread and gasoline
Go under the willow
Park her up beside the stream
Shoulders for pillows
Lay down your head and dream
Shoulders for pillows
Lay down your head and dream",2000

Candy Says,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/candysays.html,"Candy says
I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires
In this world

Candy says
I'd like to know completely
What others so discretely
Talk about

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older

What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

Candy says
I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste
Of what will be

Candy says
I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions
In my mind

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older

What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me",
Summer's End,Amorphis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amorphis/summersend.html,"In the morning mist by the waning moon
through the woods she set on foot
With a sacred blade cut the berries down
Dug up the dreaded mandrake root

[Chorus:]
Tread my path to summer's end
This bequest I leave you she says
You will see what could be evergreen
Turn to copper and fade to gray

By the standing stones
Atropine eyes smiled at me
Sitting in a sluggish vertigo
Sands of time form another dream
No love without sacrifice
No life springs without decay
The final kiss is a wormy one
In soils cold caress to rest we'll lay

Now Comes the Night,Rob Thomas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robthomas/nowcomesthenight.html,"When the hour is upon us
And our beauty's surely gone
No, you will not be forgotten
And you will not be alone
No, you will not be alone

And when the day has all but ended
And our echo starts to fade
No, you will not be alone then
And you will not be afraid
No, you will not be afraid

When the fog has finally lifted
From my cold and tired brow
No, I will not leave you crying
No, I will not let you down
No, I will not let you down
I will not let you down

Now comes the night
Feel it fading away
And the soul underneath
Is it all that remains
So just slide over here
Leave your fear in the fray
Let us hold to each other

I know that you went straight to someone else
While I worked through all this sh*t here by myself

Then you won't
And I will consider you gone

I wake up in the night
All alone and it's alright

You tell me that you're unboyfriendable

Blood,The Middle East,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/middleeast/blood.html,"Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And youâll hear your sister sleep talking
Say, âYour hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might beâ

And she woke up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
Sheâll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, youâll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings

Oh, and youâll find somebody you can blame
And youâll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And youâll find the peace of the Lord.

Grandfather, weary soul, youâll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
Youâve waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And thereâs nothing you can do about it now",P:

Draws around me softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And the candle dies

When night comes down you lock the door
The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls the waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields
A cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds and I go down
Sleeping time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird
In the haze and the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die",1971

Even though I don't have anything that I could bargain with.

This is like a well-oiled machine. Could I please see that smile again?
It's all that makes me feel that I am living in this world
I see you closing all the doors. I see the walls as they go up

Just do it then I'll let you go. Just say the words and say them slowly.

I'm the only sound you'll ever need to hear
Listen to my breath so near
Allow me to be every noise in your ear

Since that day I wake up early
Every morning which is good
But my stomach's churning, call me,
It would be nice if you could

Some days I question
The suggestion
You might not exist at all
Can we meet and talk it over
Would you be kind enough to call

Over and over
It's over all over
And over and over and over
And over.....

No there's no middle ground
Your off in another story
Or merry-go-round

No there'll be no measured terms
You fly in the face of the way the world turns

Like a frozen tidal wave
Since that day I'm standing still
You brought me here and I accept
Though you regret I never will

Just one sweet word
And then a smile from you
Is almost worth everything
I've given all I had to give
But you gave up giving in

You are everywhere I go
All the places we have been
I can't imagine where you are
For you are all I've ever seen

Over and over.....

All I've ever known
All I've ever seen
Places that I go
Places that we've been",2003

When it's cold outside hold me

I couldn't possibly permit you in

Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
And turned away without goodbye

With the sea breeze whistling all alone
O poor Mary Bellows 
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
And undid the latch on the front door

They found her the next day cuffed to the bed
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head

Baby, I might lose my mind
Maybe I might lose my head
But one thing I'll never do
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you
Baby, I'm burning our bed

There used to be a time when you were everything
My flame thru the night
You got me hot
Then you blew me out
Like this match I'm about to light

Oh, oh, oh
You can tear my heart to pieces
Left me standing in the cold

Baby, I might lose my mind
Maybe I might lose my head
One thing I gotta do
Is torch those sheets and pillows too
Baby, I'm burning out bed

Well, I used to think your were so fine
How could I be so blind

Oh, oh, oh
I'm freem
But I'm alone

[CHORUS]

Sometimes a man can bleed
Baby, I'm burning our bed

Gloomy Sunday,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/gloomysunday.html,"Sunday is Gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy
with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday",
A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/ahardrainsagonnafall.html,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, that roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall",1963
Way to Blue,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/waytoblue.html,"Don't you have a word to show what may be done
Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue?

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
If you know the way to blue?

Look through time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind.

Can you now recall all that you have known?
Will you never fall
When the light has flown?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue?",1969
'Cello Song,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/cellosong.html,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/maninashed.html,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969
After All,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/afterall.html,"Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo

There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo 

After all, after all",1970

Thats something we both forgot to do

I find it hard to see your face, du du de de hay
Cannot remember it well enough, only the details such, then I see it in my head,
When I am with you its familiar and beautiful, and ?

As night comes in I know it better, seeing it clear again

Look after me and I will look after you
Thats something we both forgot to do

Cus if I squint then I see your so, far from me, far from me
As if my miralce I see the room I see ?

The words and images they come back to me, back to me
Crystal clear in my head, but its behind the screen

Look after me and I will look after you
Thats something we both forgot to do

Everytime I see your face I break down and cry, 
I see it in your family as they walk on by

Come back to me and ill come back to you,
Thats something we dont always do

Atrocity Exhibition,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/atrocityexhibition.html,"Asylums with doors open wide,
Where people had paid to see inside,
For entertainment they watch his body twist,
Behind his eyes he says, 'I still exist.'

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

In arenas he kills for a prize,
Wins a minute to add to his life.
But the sickness is drowned by cries for more,
Pray to God, make it quick, watch him fall.

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

You'll see the horrors of a faraway place,
Meet the architects of law face to face.
See mass murder on a scale you've never seen,
And all the ones who try hard to succeed.

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

And I picked on the whims of a thousand or more,
Still pursuing the path that's been buried for years,
All the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire,
Can't replace or relate, can't release or repair,
Take my hand and I'll show you what was and will be.",1980
Summer '68,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/summer68.html,"Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you
I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago
The music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

Not a single word was said
The night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon - in a room of ninety five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man

Just to let me know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

Goodbye to you

I've had enough for one day",1970
Small Blue Thing,Suzanne Vega,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/suzannevega/smallbluething.html,"Today I am
A small blue thing
Like a marble
Or an eye

With my knees against my mouth
I am perfectly round
I am watching you

I am cold against your skin
You are perfectly reflected
I am lost inside your pocket
I am lost against
Your fingers

I am falling down the stairs
I am skipping on the sidewalk
I am thrown against the sky

I am raining down in pieces
I am scattering like light
Scattering like light
Scattering like light

Today I am
A small blue thing
Made of china
Made of glass

I am cool and smooth and curious
I never blink
I am turning in your hand
Turning in your hand
Small blue thing",1985

Independence Day,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/independenceday.html,"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late 
Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now 
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate 
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow 
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us 
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too 
But they can't touch me now 
And you can't touch me now 
They ain't gonna do to me 
What I watched them do to you 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day 
All down the line 
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day this time 

Now I don't know what it always was with us 
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines 
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us 
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind 

Well say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day all boys must run away 
So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
All men must make their way come Independence Day 

Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint 
And the highway she's deserted clear down to Breaker's Point 
There's a lot of people leaving town now 
leaving their friends, their homes 
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone 

Well Papa go to bed now, it's getting late 
Nothing we can say can change anything now 
Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways 
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say 
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
I swear I never meant to take those things away",1980
Shut Out the Light,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/shutoutthelight.html,"The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down
He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town
He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar
He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark
Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
And undid an extra button on her blouse
He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am
He was staring at the ceiling
He couldn't move his hands

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said ""Johnny Welcome Home""
Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome
His mama said ""Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me""
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
In the cold black water Johnson Leneir stands
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Anna Begins,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/annabegins.html,"My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
I am not worried,
I am not overly concerned

My friend implored me,
""For one time only
Make an exception.""
I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried 
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
""Oh"", she says, ""you're changing.""
We're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love

Because if you don't want to talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess I'm gonna have to live without
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things
You try to tell yourself to make yourself forget
To make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" she said,
""Then we're gonna have to think about the consequences""
But she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering
For days,"" she says.
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend.
And I'm not gonna break and
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say,
""As long as this is love...""
But it's not all that easy
So maybe I should 
Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause I've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
But I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind
Every time she sneezes I believe it's love
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand
And, oh, Lord, I m not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away.
She disappears,
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing",1993
Top of the World,Dixie Chicks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dixiechicks/topoftheworld.html,"I wished I was smarter
I wished I was stronger 
I wished I loved Jesus 
The way my wife does 
I wish it had been easier 
Instead of any longer 
I wished I could have stood where you would have been proud 
But that won't happen now 
That won't happen now

There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird 
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now 
Top of the world

I don't have to answer any of these questions 
Don't have no God to teach me no lessons 
I come home in the eveing 
Sit in my chair 
One night they called me for supper 
But I never got up 
I stayed right there in my chair

There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird 
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now 
Top of the world

I wished I'd a known you 
Wished I'd a shown you 
All of the things I was on the inside 
I'd pretend to be sleeping 
When you come in in the morning 
To whisper good-bye 
Go to work in the rain 
I don't know why 
Don't know why

'Cause everone's singing 
We just wanna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Wanna grab a hold of that little song bird 
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world",2002
The Weakness In Me,Joan Armatrading,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joanarmatrading/theweaknessinme.html,"I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you get my attention

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly

Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep
If I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
And I need you, and you

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly",1981
Nobody,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/nobody.html,"When life seems full
Of clouds and rain
And I'm full
Of nothin' but pain
Who soothes my thumpin', bumpin' brain?
Nobody

When wintertime comes
With its snow and sleet
And me with hunger
And cold feet
Who says ""Here's two bits, go and eat""?
Nobody

Well, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time

When summertime comes
All warm and clear
And my friends see me
Drawin' near
Who says ""Come on in and have a beer""?
Nobody

Well, one time when things was lookin' bright
I started to whittlin' on a stick one night
Who said ""Hey! That's dynamite!""?
Nobody

Mmmm, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time

Into The Dark,Melissa Etheridge,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melissaetheridge/intothedark.html,"There were stairs they were steep
I was falling falling deep 
You were there you were small 
There was screaming down the hall

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There comes a time we all know 
There's a place that we must go
Into the soul into the heart 
Into the dark 

There was fire there was death
There was lying on your breath
I turned away I would pretend 
But the burning never ends 

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There was a wave over the house 
There was fear choked in my mouth 
You were there you left your mark 
As I stumbled in the dark",1999

Lost Unto this World,Emmylou Harris,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/emmylouharris/lostuntothisworld.html,"I was once some mother's darlin'
Some daddy's little girl
More precious than the ruby
More cherished than the pearl
My heart was full of mercy
And my forehead full of curl
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world
I am lost unto this world...

They herded me like cattle
Cut me down like corn
Took me from my babies
Before they could be born
You can blame it on the famine
You can blame it on the war
You can blame it on the devil
It don't matter anymore
I am lost unto this world...

I was tortured in the desert
I was raped out on the piain
I was murdered by the high way
And my cries went up in vain
My blood is on the mountain
My blood is on the sand
My blood runs in the river
That now washes thru their hands
I am lost unto this world...
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil
Was God the only one there watching
And weeping as l feil
O you among the living
Will you remember me at all
Will you write my name out
With a single finger scrawl
Across a broken window
In some long forgotten wall
That goes stretching out forever
Where the tears of heaven fall
I am lost unto this world...",2003
Song for the Angels,Great Lake Swimmers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatlakeswimmers/songfortheangels.html,"The echo to your yell
The ripple to your dive
The currents under your wave

Electricity 
Flows through me
I send it out to you
We were charged 
With the founding poles
Of a million years
A million years
Before us 
Have trembled in their fears

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you where there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

I know that I am just a grain of sand
Meeting water at the land
We could make our castles here
And sweep them all away

I know that I am just a drop of water
Frozen into ice on the stormy earth 
Who gave us birth
Over and over in cycles 
Lovely cycles

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me",2005
Waiting for Love,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/waitingforlove.html,"[Verse 1]
She looks to the sun 
Help her to carry on
Braking down all the years 
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky 
Counting the reasons why 
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past

[B-Section]
All the changes, and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says

[Verse 2]
She looks to the stars
Breaking, time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

[B-Section]
And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
A she is starting to drown

[Chorus]
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
Waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long

[Verse 3]
She prays to the Gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where I am today
Life is looking very grey

[B-Section]
All the changes, all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm waiting for a new day to rise
COnversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And I want it, and I need it, and I'll leave it all behind

And all the changes I've made
And I remember the words, that you'll never say

[Chorus (3x)]

She looks to the sun",2003

Or like cio-cio
You will end up burned by love or sickness

And why don't you ladies believe me when i'm screaming
I always believe you

There is a knock at the door
Tell me it's not mimi again
Or is it Gilda's waiting passion to be stabbed and killed again

With eyes that dance around without their clothes 
So buy a pretty dress 
Wear it out tonight 
For anyone you think could out do me 

Or better still be my winding wheel 
Cause I feel just like a map 
Without a single place to go of interest 
And I'm further North than South 

If I could shut my mouth shed probably like this 
So buy a pretty dress 
And wear it out tonight 
For all the boys you think could out do me 
Or better still be my winding wheel 

Be my winding wheel 
Well the children laugh and sing a song that ushers in her driving rain 

And I'm standing in the station like some old record waiting on a train 
So buy a pretty dress 
Wear it out tonight 
For anyone you think could out do me 
Or better still be my winding wheel 

Be my winding wheel",2000

When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
May, she will stay,
Resting in my arms again.

June, she'll change her tune,
In restless walks she'll prowl the night;
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight.

August, die she must,
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old.",1966

Tram pam pam pam, but
If you think I'm wasting your time again
No, oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team

Oooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream

So when you think you're on the fast track
You find it's just a cul-de-sac back
In that adult lifestyle community
Where all your little boys, your action toys are duty free

Oooh please don't get too excited
Ooooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream

So I wonder what you got your persona for
Cause there's a 2-for-one down at the corner-store
And I wonder could ya pep it up a bit
You know throw a fit
You go ahead and dance
I'll just sit

If you think I'm wasting your time again
I'm wasting your time again
oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team

Oh, I'm looking at the back of my hand again,

Lake Erie

Driving through the line
We pretend we are from Africa
If we fall far behind

I am brave

On the streets you were policin' that was you

To the one I now know most
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever was

And all that ever mattered
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing

In a dream I saw you walkin'
With your friends alive and talkin', that was you
Well I saw it in your movements
And even though you never knew it, well I knew

Just how sweet it could be
If you'd never left these streets

Best Imitation of Myself,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/bestimitationofmyself.html,"I feel like a quote out of context
Withholding the rest
So I can be free what you want to see
I got the gesture and sound
Got the timing down
It's uncanny, yeah, you think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent
Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck
I do the best imitation of myself

The ""problem with you"" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
The best imitation of myself",1995

I think making up, faking up stories is alright
Tick tock stop the clock, fiction is my thing
My attitude is always I and me and mine

Oh I'm so clever
Until my paranoia kicks in then I'll accuse her
Of doing all the worst things i do best
Its funny how me, fucking her about,
Has got me in this fucking mess

Liar liar pants on fire
Lies alibis lies more alibis
From the truth, I admit I'm more than shy
Ain't the the times we are living in
Everybody's doing it so why cant i?

I tally up tonight's strangers
And stragglers that I've kissed
Training ground notches, perfectly executed notches
And near misses
Its all about going out and getting pissed with eagle eyes
And sincerity bottom on my list
What's the story morning glory?
I feel so low and worthless

So this is where the outcome unfurls and the truth is being told
A cloud has gathered over my head and now i know
Infidelity and my good friend ecstasy doesn't work, it makes you worse
I'm feeling so guilty about the things i said to my mum when i was ten years old
I'm feeling so guilty about any old shit
And how I think my missus is fucking every guy that she looks at
This is it, the end was always coming and now its here

So this is the grande finale
The crescendo of demise
This is the happy ending
Where the bad guy goes down and dies
This is the end
With me on my knees and wondering why?
Cross my heart, hope to die
Its my own cheating heart that makes me cry",2008

Unforgivable Sinner,Lene Marlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lenemarlin/unforgivablesinner.html,"Kinda lose your sense of time
'Cause the days don't matter no more
All the feelings that you hide
Gonna tear you up inside
You hope she knows you tried

Follows you around all day
And you wake up soaking wet
'Cause between this world and eternity
There is a face you hope to see

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
But you can't hear those words
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
Unforgivable Sinner

You've been walking around in tears
No answers are there to get
You won't ever be the same
Someone cries and you're to blame

Struggling with a fight inside
Sorrow you'll defeat
The picture you see it won't disappear
Not unpleasant dreams or her voice you hear

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
But you can't hear those words
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
Unforgivable Sinner

Maybe one time lost
But now you're found
Stand right up before
You hit the ground
Maybe one time lost
But now you're found
Stand right up before
You hit the ground - hit the ground

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there

The Mercy Seat,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/themercyseat.html,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.
And I'll say it again
I.. am.. not.. afraid.. to.. die.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand
tattooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that devil blood.

And the mercy seat is a-burning
And I think my head is flowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway, there was no proof
And nor a motive why.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A life for a life
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.

Now the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A eye for a eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm not afraid to lie.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.",1988

Fifty Thousand miles from home.
Sometimes I'm weak and the past is my guide, 
Summer returns and puts you back on my mind",2001
Where We Would Be,Porcupine Tree,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/porcupinetree/wherewewouldbe.html,"[Written by Steven Wilson]

Tied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

If I could find you
And tell you about my life
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young",2000

One last time
Did I hold you too tight
Did I not let enough light in

If your mind should sway

We used to be closer than this
We used to get closer than this
Is it something you miss

We used to be closer than this

Suddenly Everything Has Changed,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/suddenlyeverythinghaschanged.html,"[Flaming Lips Cover]

Putting all the vegetables away
that you bought at the grocery store today.
And it goes fast, you think of the past.

Suddenly everything has changed.

Driving home the sky accelerates.
And the clouds all form a geometric shape.
And it goes fast, you think of the past.

Suddenly everything has changed.

Putting all the clothes you washed away,
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate.
Then it goes fast, you think of the past.

Suddenly everything has changed.",
Stop the Show,Built to Spill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/builttospill/stoptheshow.html,"You don't tell me anything

You don't owe me anything
The offering is already mine
Your best friend is everywhere
They don't care, they think you're slime

You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised

After a while you know the style and that's enough to know they suck
And when you know to stop the show because you know they know
I know it's sad but don't feel bad, they knew they had it coming
After a while it hurts to smile and if you laugh, it's just a typical miracle",1997

The Center of the World,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/thecenteroftheworld.html,"At the center of the world 
There's a statue of a girl.
She is standing near a well 
With a bucket bare and dry.

I went and looked her in the eyes 
And she turned me into sand.
This clumsy form that I despise 
It scattered easy in her hand.

And came to rest upon a beach, 
With a million others there.
We sat and waited for the sea 
To stretch out so that we could disappear 

Into the endlessness of blue,
Into the horror of the truth.
You see, we are far less than we knew.
Yeah, we are far less than we knew

But we knew what we could taste.
Girls found honey to drench our hands.
Men cut marble to mark our graves.
Said we'll need something to remind us of 
All the sweetness that has passed through us
(fresh sangria and lemon tea).
The priests dressed children for a choir
(white-robed small voices praise Him)
But found no joy in what was sung.
The funeral had begun 

In the middle of the day
When you drive home to your place 
From that job that makes you sleep
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake 

Long after night has come to claim 
Any light that still remains 
In the corner of the frame 
That you put around her face.

Two pills just weren't enough.
The alarm clock's going off 
But you're not waking up.
This isn't happening, happening, happening, 
Happening, happening. It is.",2000

Below the kids come out tonight, / they kick a ball and have a fight 
and maybe shoot somebody if they lose at pool. 
Ooh, / it's a mess alright, / yes it's / Mile End.

How could I say goodbye

Company Calls Epilogue,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/companycallsepilogue.html,"Synapse to synapse... the possibility's thin.
I'm dressed up for free drinks and family greetings on your wedding date.
The figures in plastic on the wedding cake that i took were so real.
And i kept a distance... the complications cloud the postcards and blips through fiberoptics,
As the girls with the pigtails were running from little boys wearing bowties their parent bought...
""i'll catch you this time!""
Crashing through the parlor doors, what was your first reaction?
Screaming, drunk, disorderly... i'll tell you mine.
You were the one but i can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately.
Synapse to synapse...
The sneaky kids had attached beer cans to the bumper so they could drive up and down the main drag.
People would turn to see who's making the racket. it's not the first time.
When they lay down the fish will swim upstream and i'll contest but they won't listen when the casualty rate's near 100%,
And there isn't a pension for second best or for hardly moving...

I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk
You would take me to the movie
You would take me to the beach
Take me to a place inside that is so hard to reach

Doing all that i could

Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
With a five dollar bill
I never understood you then and I guess I never will

My dad he gave me a name
Then he walked away
Daddy gave me a name
Then he walked away
My dad gave me a name

With the children you abandoned
And the wife I saw you beat
I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I am a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear I'm not going to let her know

Maid Of Bond Street,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/maidofbondstreet.html,"This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairs",1967

Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer

But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.

On your birthday when mom passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.

Put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but..
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.
Panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you

[Chorus]

I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away.
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.

I never cared about God when life was sailin' in the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mom says me and you are the same from the start.

I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.

[Chorus x2]

But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.

I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
You always said I should hedge my bets.",2006

Have no fear,
The monster's gone,

And your daddy's here,

Say a little prayer,

In every way,
It's getting better and better,

Out on the ocean sailing away,
I can hardly wait
To see you to come of age,
But I guess we'll both
Just have to be patient,

'Cause it's a long way to go,
A hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go
But in the meantime,

Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is what happens to you,
While you're busy making other plans,

Before you go to sleep,
Say a little prayer,

In every way,

Drowned World/Substitute for Love,Madonna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madonna/drownedworldsubstituteforlove.html,"I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

[Chorus:]

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

[chorus]

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

This is my religion",1998
The Next Time You Say Forever,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/thenexttimeyousayforever.html,"I hear the tiniest sparks in the tenderest sound. 
Diving music, drowning the sound. 
waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. 
And your fire flood alarm, and you tremble, and you stumble, and you scrape up your palms. 
I can't stay here to hold your hand. 
I've been away for so long. 
I've lost my taste for home, and that's a dirty fallow feeling.
To be the dangling ceiling. 
From the roof came crashing down. 
Peeling in the heat.
Vanish in the rain.
The next time you say forever, I'll punch you in your face. 
Just because you don't believe it, doesn't mean I didn't mean it.
You never know when I'll show you the never.
You never know when I'll show you the never.",2009
Railroad Man,Eels,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eels/railroadman.html,"Feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues

And i know i can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And i guess i may never understand
The times that i live in
Are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now
And this train is just too slow

It may take a little longer but i'll know

Will I need my friends
Something just to ease away the pain
And now I never see the loneliness
Behind my face
I am just a prisoner to my faith

If I could only stand and stare in the mirror could I see
One fallen hero with a face like me?
And if I scream, could anybody hear me?
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where's the love to shelter me
Give me love, come set me free
Where's the love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
Set me free

Waltz #2 (XO),Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/waltz2xo.html,"First the mic, then a half cigarette
Singing Kathy's clown
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed
So she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

Now she's done, and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
'Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Can't you tell that it's well understood?

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

I'm here today, expect it to stay on, and on, and on
I'm tired, I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO Mom
It's OK, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans
To just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

These Streets,Paolo Nutini,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paolonutini/thesestreets.html,"Cross the border
Into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour
Just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul 
from the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to delay this sadness
That creeps up my spine
And haunts me through the night

Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wandering around
With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody floods to their ideal place
And the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually

Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wandering around
With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

I'll get used to this eventually

Violence,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/violence.html,"Six bottles went down the drain
One hour's a waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And afterâ¦and afterâ¦and after)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill meâ¦
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill meâ¦

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

[Lady's voice:]
My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read your letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, yourself
I keep thinking of you darling
I keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way
So I could come home to see you
But things don't look too good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could miss any one person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer 'til I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life",2003

It stretches on forever
I walk through this abyss of consciousness
Relying only on my heartbeat when I face you
The open blue reflecting eternal possibility
The words we exchange intertwine
A melancholy figure, hanging heavily
Surfaces in my mind
There must be a heart there
Soon noise will drown it out
Returning to the concealed light
My voice raised, yearning to go back
White waves stop quietly
The song of the clouds breaking the surface
Letters of promise to the insane sunlight
I gaze at the fragments of thought spread out at my feet
Tears of hope for those unfulfilled
To whom do the stars belong?
Someday this sadness' end
Will be returned to us and the story will continue
Silhouettes reflected in my eyes
Countless faint smiles lined up before me
Gazing towards the exit
This beloved landscape
A vision brings
An instant of whiteness and the palm of my hand
All exists within one stride
Bells sound the arrival of the flood
The bridge of the sky and the clamour of twilight
I pass through this night in silence
I extinguish my lamp and in the moonlit street
Give an innocent smile for the happiness to come",2006
Solitary,VNV Nation,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vnvnation/solitary.html,"Set me aflame and cast me free
Away, you wretched world of tethers
Through the endless night and day

Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

In this picture stands a man
Far away, alone and distant
Like a solitary field
In some nameless foreign land
All around him points of light
Start to dim and cease transmitting
Shadows fell on futile games
And then there was nothing more
Through the screams of falling steel
By the light of flares and wisdom
All the doubts I could not face
All this time I wanted more
With a line I mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
To the Gods whose names we've lost
And the names who gave in vain

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

Sever the line to the guilty past
To the ones who brought us nothing
Spoke of futures brave and proud
And brought only hate and war
Line the roads with hollow praise
Mark the land with paper statues
Shadows fell on their futile ways
And then there was nothing more",1998
Black Heart,Calexico,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/calexico/blackheart.html,"Spring is frozen now I'm stuck in low
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
Can't find no poison, now I've got no cure
(the) fangs are stuck inside my skin

Payne county line
Watching unjust claims
One man's righteousness is another man's
Long haul, sentence carried out
Long haul, counting the miles
To the four corners of the world

Spring is rusted shut, (faith's) coiled and cracked
Apparitions worth their weight in gold
Scratched in metal, name erodes away
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
Burnt though, and ashen

Trip on fence post line
Sifting through the remains
One man's close pursuit is another man's
Last chance, make it through the divide
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this
Black heart, sweeping over the land
Black heart, crawling its way
To the four corners of the world",2003

You offer no reply

Should I call a doctor
For I fear that you might be dead
But I just lay down beside you
And held your head

I fell in love with you
Now you're my one and only
Cause all my life I've been so blue
But in that moment you fulfilled me

Now I tell all my friends
I fell in love with a dead boy
And I tell my family
I wish you could have met him

I write letters to Australia
I throw a bottle out to sea
And I whisper the secret in the ground
No one's gonna take you away from me

I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy
And I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy

Oh, such a beautiful boy

Are you a boy or a girl""

Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer)

Wasted truth 
Why call at all blue 
Hot lines
Eventual decline 
With the right attitude 
You will succeed blue 
Resent that discontent 
Sidestep 
Define 
The state of things 
So far 
Crazy things
Soft-spoken
With your eyes open
You know soft-spoken changes nothing

A view so cruel (A view so cruel)

Dream Scream,Daniel Johnston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danieljohnston/dreamscream.html,"I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you
I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you

Everything you have done
You were the girl
Who seemed to own the world
Everything was about you

I took a chance to call you my own
I didn't know a thing about you

Thought you could love
What a fool I was

What's going on
I was just singing my song
There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldn't I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldn't stand to chance without you

You said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldn't believe it

And on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

Thought there was love
What a fool I was

And everything was in hyper-jinx
Just like an old time movie

You don't understand
Can't comprehend

I guess it doesn't really matter

And every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

I thought I was loved
What a fool I was

Having dreams about you
Having dreams about you
Having dreams about you
Having dreams about you",2001
Sweet Wine,Cream,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cream/sweetwine.html,"Ba, ba, ba [etc]

Who wants the worry, the hurry of city life.
Money, nothing funny, wasting the best of our life.

We can wait till tomorrow.
Car speed, road calling, bird freed, leaf falling.
We can bide time.

When Sorrow Sang,Blind Guardian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindguardian/whensorrowsang.html,"So let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back light and hope for all

And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand

Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) hope's turned to dust
At all

Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon

[Chorus:]
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet

I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye

Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her

So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind

The Carpenter,Nightwish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nightwish/thecarpenter.html,"Who are you?
Man condemned to shine a salvation
throughout the centuries
Why ?
Was the wine of the grail
too sour for man to drink

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter

The one they lick
The same old sick
dream of their precious saviour

Kiss them deep and

make them weep
over promises of eternal peace

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter

I hear you
through the symphonic voices of nature
- the purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
and observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter",1997
To Live Is to Hide,Lacuna Coil,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/toliveistohide.html,"[Music: Coti Zelati/Lyrics: Scabbia - Ferro]

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking in their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause a blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

I'm going to freeze
Is it my imagination?
It's underground

But I can feel it the same

What I need now
What I need is to live to hide
When you smothered my devotion
With your lies

And I feel now
As I did that time
That I'm wondering why
Still I make you cry

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause to blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

Suffering while I'm depending on seasons
Roots under me are embracing the earth",2001
How?,John Lennon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/how.html,"How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing?
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn?
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of?

How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling?
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel?
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied?
Oh no, oh no

You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?

And the world she is tough

Alternative 4,Anathema,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anathema/alternative4.html,"It's killing you, you're killing me
I'm clinging on to my sanity
All I need is a short term remedy
Come and hide me from this terrible reality...

Dreaded memories flood back to me
But there's still a willful mind behind these cold
psychotic eyes
Now I tread this path so differently
I've opened my mind and darkened my entire life.

I'll dance with the angels to celebrate the holocaust,
And far beyond my far gone pride,
Is knowing that we'll soon be gone,
Knowing that I'll soon be gone...

Find the one who'll guide you to the limits of your choice

Hearts of Olden Glory,Runrig,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/runrig/heartsofoldenglory.html,"There's thunder clouds around the hometown bay
As I walk out in the rain
Through the sepia showers
And the photo flood days

I caught a fleeting glimpse of life
And though the water's black as night
The colours of Scotland leave you young inside

There's a vision coming soon
Through the faith that cleans your wound
Hearts of olden glory will be renewed

Down the lens where the headlands stand
I feel a healing through this land
A cross for a people
Like wind through your hands

There must be a place under the sun
Where hearts of olden glory grow young",1987
Send In The Clowns,Frank Sinatra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/sendintheclowns.html,"[Spoken intro]
This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent, oh, quite a long time
together, till one day
one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave. Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant.
It's a breakup.
It's a lovely marriage of words and music, written by Stephen Sondheim.

Isn't it rich? Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground and you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around and one who can't move
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted  was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair

Sure of my lines
Nobody's there

Don't you love a farce? My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want, sorry my dear
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Don't bother they're here

Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late in my career
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Well, maybe next year",ompi
Cry! Cry! Cry!,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/crycrycry.html,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye, ""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.",1957
Swanheart,Nightwish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nightwish/swanheart.html,"All those beautiful people
I want to have them all
All those porcelain models
If only I could make them fall

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

A wintry eve
Once upon a tale
An Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrow's carol
Dreaming the stars

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

In my world
Love is for poets
Never the famous balcony scene
Just a dying faith
On a heaven's gate

Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born",1998
This Night Has Opened My Eyes,The Smiths,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smiths/thisnighthasopenedmyeyes.html,"In a river the colour of lead
Immerse a baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
He said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
So, save your life
Because you've only got one

The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh but then again she left pain
So please save your life
Because you've only got one

The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad",1984

When you think I don't have a clue
Baby you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
`Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your B films

I've got to let it go and leave it gone
Just walk away, stop it going on
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long
But maybe someday...

Start to feel, and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come...
Again!

So tell me someday's come tell me some days come again...

No I won't do it some more, doesn't make any sense
If it can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense
But maybe someday...

I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel, and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come...

If I could do it again maybe just once more
Think I could make it work like I did it before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday is the end
Oh maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again...",2000

When no one's in a hurry there'll be days like this
When you don't get betrayed by that old Judas kiss

When you don't need an answer there'll be days like this
When you don't meet a chancer there'll be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit
Then I must remember there'll be days like this

When everyone is up front and they're not playing tricks
When you don't have no freeloaders out to get their kicks
When it's nobody's business the way that you wanna live
I just have to remember there'll be days like this

When no one steps on my dreams there'll be days like this
When people understand what I mean there'll be days like this
When you ring out the changes of how everything is

Made foundations quiver
Every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break
And I shiver...

The leftover tallow just doesn't contain
All the right answers
Under a sea of dust lies a vast wealth of wisdom

An untouched snow turns red
Innocence dies

This black page in history is not colourfast, will stain the next
All that remains is just a feint of what was meant to be
This black page in history is not colourfast, will stain the next
And nothing seems in life, in dreams like what was meant to be",2003
Duk Koo Kim,Sun Kil Moon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sunkilmoon/dukkookim.html,"Looking out on my roof last night
Woken up from a dream
I saw a typhoon coming in close
Bringing the clouds down to the sea

Making the world look gray and alone
Taking all light from my view
Keeping everyone in
And keeping me here with you

Around you now
I can't sleep no more, baby
Around you still
Don't want to leave yet

Woken up from a dream last night
Somewhere lost in war
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
I didn't feel right anymore

I knew there I'd die alone
With no one to reach to
But an angel came down
And brought me back to you

I'd rather leave
This world forever, baby
Than let life go
The way it's going

Watching an old fight film last night
Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
But the pounding took to him

And there in the square he lay alone
Without face, without crown
And the angel who looked upon him
She never came down

You never know
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Out of the air
Out of nowhere

Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known

Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known

Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love

You drove straight through and mined that quarry
For all it could bleed 'til dry
I took a little more 'til I got taken for granted
'cause beautiful boys gave chase
And when they arch your backbone
It's such a dreadful sight

Something's got to break you down [x2]

With jealous fits that gag and bind you

All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Two headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
There is no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go",1998
Lament,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/lament.html,"Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile

Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh the smell as candles die

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge",ompi
Dream Brother,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/dreambrother.html,"There is a child sleeping near his twin 
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind 
That dark angel he is shuffling in 
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair 
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair 
Her green eyes blew goodbyes 
With her head in her hands 
and your kiss on the lips of another 
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world. 

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
Nobody ever came 
Nobody ever... 

I feel afraid and I call your name 
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain 
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another 
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 

Ah do you meet the one I love 
and smell the one who loves you 
Dream brother, dream brother, dream, dream
dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over",1994
Blind,TV on the Radio,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tvontheradio/blind.html,"I seen a girl
With a guy
With hair like yours
From what I remember

He took her hand
And smiled her name
Her face like yours
She smiled the same

From what I remember
Been so long since last December
She walked your walk
She talked like you

She shimmered strong
She shined right through
From what I remember
I said I seen a girl

With a guy
So who I'd seen
So who am I
Now I can't remember


Been so long since last December
So I'm sending
Open letter to the perfect girlfriend

I'm still mighty tiny
Hoping that you'd be my little godsend
Because right now I'll take any and blindly
Before I find another noose to fit us

Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other
What's the difference
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Open letter to the legions leering
Oh, how we entertained you
Why don't you cast your gaze into the moonlit clearing

Cause my love, my love is a suckerbet
Before I find another noose to fit us
Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other

What's the problem
Why don't you save yourself 
I'll save you all the time
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame 

Save yourself, I'll save you all the time (x2)",P:

And when in this life in this life 
When I can only turn my chin 
I know it's gonna be alright

And I have lost again

Could be I won't be wrong

Pulling Our Weight,The Radio Dept.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiodept/pullingourweight.html,"In time we might walk the straight line
But with memories of a grapevine
A guitar, as we came close from far
Forgot about the war
We barely touched
As if being watched

And even in time
Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line
Pulling our weight

Many miles from where Iâm sleeping
You share laughter in the evening
As do I, in the great divine
Yours is mine
Weâll find love
The kind weâre dreaming of

And even in time
Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line
Pulling our weight",P:

I can't believe I'm writing a song
Where ""friend"" rhymes with ""end""
But today
I must cave in
I have trouble forgetting those beautiful eyes
As it is
I must fill your space with lies

Friend
You left me in the end
I guess I knew it all along
I guess I expected this song
And it is as it appeared
Like a fist in my stomach and swallowing tears
Your song turned out a sad one
Just as I feared",2005

To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees

You know they want it, but there's no first
On your own
But you can not call it your all

We always wrung our heads too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your unknown

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy, but devil's plan
On your own
You can not call me your all

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
But you can not; you will not agree",2006

Lazarus at Frankenstein's,
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
A little we die, above the lesser light

of the beat to lick a wound to
cursed for some and blessed for a few

Come hither and we'll fall
In love, for love
I'm crawling out of patience baby

Lazarus at Frankenstein's,
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
A little we die, above the lesser light

Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller

Paint all your sorrows for me to sing
Heartkiller
Draw your pain and hear me hum it out

Their marks in the pavement

What if I changed the signs?
Would you even take notice?

You beg me then you break me
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You made me feel like a sinner
Now you fear you'll die alone
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

The plague that made me starve

Break me open

The days before I was born,
How we were as children

Do you remember how you used to touch my hair?
You're not aware
Your hands keep still
You just don't know that I am here

It hurts too much
I pray now that soon you'll release
To where you belong

You touch my hand
These colors come alive
In your heart and in your mind
I cross the borders of time
Leaving today behind to be with you again

Please, say my name
Remember who I am 
You will find me in the world of yesterday
You drift away again
To far from where I am
When you ask me who I am

Say my name

In your heart and in your mind
I cross the borders of time
Leaving today behind to be with you again

Shatter with words
Impossible to follow

I search only
For something
I can't see

I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city your mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city your mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city your mountains

I wanna hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'till I'm through

I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darling, don't you cry

I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie

I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try

Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well everyone I know has got a reason
To say, ""Put the past away.""

That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again

And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left you
You've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today
You could put the past away

I wish you would step back from
That ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in

Placed in your mind

There will be noise 
There will be glad 
And a perfect bed

And when you write a poem 
I know the words, I know the sounds 
Before you write it down 
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes 
And the jacket too

In your mothers arms

And the bubble of your interests ready to burst

He whistles and he runs

We saw you in distraction: a sleeping, slow despair
Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature âThough you wish you were the wind
â¦Ã Ã£ boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end

He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn, you want to let it last

He has a keen eye for what you used to be

When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead men
You cannot leave",2004

And breathing in smoke signs like a puppet told to drive
And will you come back? Will you come back?

When I saw you looking like I never thought

But what's it gonna cost to be gone?
If we see you like I hoped we never would

When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way

So take it as a song or a lesson to learn
And sometime soon be better than you were
If you say you're gonna go, then be careful
And watch how you treat every living soul

And we'll cut up my face 'cause it's too plain. 
You are this! 
I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
I swear it's this town I will not see. 
Ha ha, ha, ha ha, I tricked you again. 

Anything but silence, anything you say 
will stay in my head for days and days. 
But I'm sorry we couldn't make it back this evening. 
But I'm still hoping. 
We have to move or so it seems. 
I guess the hospitals are near 'cause I can hear those screams, 
and you breathing over me. 
Well ha ha, ha, I tricked you once again 'cause you are nothing.

But I promise someday we'll drive away. 
And we'll cut up my face 'cause it's too plain. 
You are this! 

Well it's here, 
and your expensive taste 
that we should have framed this place. 
And kept it in your shelf. 
Next to you big city dreams. 
It's in your touch it seems. 
But you wear that on your sleeve, 
and all the thoughts that make you bleed. 

I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
So go ahead kid we loved it. 
Sing it loud before the light hits, 
and we are forced to move. 
With your window up we can keep the light out
And you can keep the light out",2005
(*Fin),Anberlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anberlin/fin.html,"Feels like you're miles from here, 
in other towns with lesser names.
Where the unholy ghost doesn't tell 
Mary or William exactly what they want to hear.
You remember the house on Ridge Road 
told you and the Devil to both just leave me alone.
If this is salvation, I can show you the trembling. 
You'll just have to trust me. I'm scared.

I am the patron saint of lost causes. 
Aren't we all to you just near lost causes? 
Aren't we all to you just lost

Tommy, you left behind 
something that will mean everything right before you die.
What if you gained the whole world? 
You've already lost four little souls from your life. 
Widows and orphans aren't hard to find.
They're home missing daddy who's saving the abandoned tonight.
Wish your drinking would hurry and kill you. 
Sympathy's better than having to tell you the truth.

That you are the patron saint of lost causes. 
All you are to them is now a lost cause. 
All you are to them is now, causes.

Billy, don't you understand? 
Timothy stood as long as he could and now 
you made his faith disappear. 
More like a magician and less like a man of the cloth.
We're not questioning God. 
Just those he chose to carry on His cross.
We're no better, you'll see. 
Just all of us, the lost causes.

Aren't we all to you just lost causes? 
Are we all to you lost?
Lost causes
So all we are to you,
Is all we are, is all we are
All we are is all we are

[Choir:]
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you? (Lost causes, all we are is all we are)
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you? (To you, lost...)

Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?

Take what you will, what you will
And leave. Could you kill, could you kill me
If the world was on fire 
and nothing was left but hope or desire 
And take all that I could bring forth, is this hell
Or am I on the floor over-desperate? 
Hold hands streaming of blood again?
And then take full weight of me 
Guard my dreams, figure this out, 
It's me on my own. Helpless, hurting, hell
Will you stay strong as you promised?
Cause I'm stranded and bare.
Meanness is washed up in all that I am 
is God. Take this and all,
Then grace takes me to a place 
Of the father you never had 
Ripping and breaking and tearing apart 
This is not heaven
This is my hell.",2007
Murder in the City,The Avett Brothers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avettbrothers/murderinthecity.html,"If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over alarmed
I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both
In so many different ways""

If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list
Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name",P:  
Astair,Matt Costa,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mattcosta/astair.html,"Astair your glare is killing me
Astair in skies of blue
The signs you wear are making me
So confused

But the mountains and the trees
Are they just what you need
Or are they less than what 
You'd expect to see

And if you're leaving well come 
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now now
Before you turn around

Astair you're there and I'm still here
I swear I'm so confused
The signs you wear are making me
Feel like I'm the one to lose

But the canyons and the seas 
Are they just what you need
Or are they less than what
You'd expect to see

And if you're leaving well come 
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now, now

Before you turn around

But the mountains and the trees 
Are they what you perceive
Or are they less than what
You'd expect to see

And if you're leaving well come 
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now, now
Before you turn around",2005
99% Of Us Is Failure,Matthew Good,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matthewgood/99ofusisfailure.html,"I know that it's bad
That it's the kind that they can't operate on
And I know it's real slow, honey
Painful and real slow
Styrofoam coffee cups
And bagged drugs that never work enough
And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

When we were young
And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands
But when 99% of us is failure
There's no going back

And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

Blackbird come the break of dawn
The TV's on, I turn it off
Walk outside, get in the car
Stare at the wheel then fall apart

I get it all the time
Bright eyes to bat and hide behind
But I know they're just for show, honey
Painful and just for show
Black rooms to babysit
White halls to pace and wait for it
And I know it's too slow, honey
Painful and real slow

When we were young
And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands
When 99% of us is failure
There's no coming back

And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

Blackbird come the break of day
You swallow the shit that people say
Walk outside look at the sky
Ask it to fall or tell you why",2007
Minerva,Deftones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deftones/minerva.html,"I get all...numb
When she sings it's over
Such a strange numb
And it brings my knees to the earth

And God bless you all 
For the song you saved us...

You're the same...numb
When you sing it's over
Such a strange numb
It could bring back peace to the earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us...oh...
For the hearts you break, everytime you moan...

I get all...numb
We're the same numb
And it brings our knees to the earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us..oh...
For the hearts you break, everytime you moan
And God bless you all on the earth...",2003
