Yellow Submarine,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/yellowsubmarine.html,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine",1966

how i feel
but i can dance, dance, dance
couldn't possibly tell you

so when i trip on my feet
look at the beat

written in the sand
when i'm shaking my hips
look for the swing
the words are
written in the air

oh dance
i was a dancer all along
dance, dance, dance
words can never make up for what you do

easy conversations,
there's no such thing
oh, i'm shy, shy, shy

Crazy Little Thing Called Love,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/crazylittlethingcalledlove.html,"This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (ooh, ooh), it jives (ooh, ooh)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock-n-roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it

Hey Man (Now You're Really Living),Eels,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eels/heymannowyourereallyliving.html,"Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what
This life is all about

Well i just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill
But hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh cut grass
And thought about the moment and when it will pass
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what
This life is all about

Now what would you say if i told you that
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat
Hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
Hey man now you're really living

People sing
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

Never used to give me much of a thrill

Octopus's Garden,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/octopussgarden.html,"I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you",1969
(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/ifyourewonderingifiwantyoutoiwantyouto.html,"The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain't got all night

The rest of the summer was the best we've ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said

Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (swear it's true)
Without you my heart is blue, oh
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain't got all night

So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say

When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me
Then I'll say

Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (swear it's true)
Without you my heart is blue oh
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)

Lisztomania,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/lisztomania.html,"So sentimental
Not sentimental no!
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, Iâm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
Iâve been looking for something else

Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do
Letâs go slowly, discouraged,
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This loveâs for gentlemen only
Thatâs with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

[Chorus 2x:]
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This loveâs for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that youâre lonely
Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do

Letâs go slowly, discouraged,
Weâll burn the pictures instead
When itâs all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

[Chorus 2x]

Ooh, this is showtime, this is showtime, this is showtime [2x]
Time, time to show it off, time to show it off, it's time to show [2x]

From a mess to the masses!

When I'm Sixty-Four,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/whenimsixtyfour.html,"When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forevermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Gave me gear thank you dear bring yer sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

And I'll dance for little Steven and Joanna

Waking up in the midday sun
What's to live for?

Staring at emotion
In the light of day

Looking for treasure
In the things that you threw
Like a magpie
I live for glitter, not you

I'm finally looking around
Left here on my own
I'm gonna hurt myself
Maybe losing my mind
I'm still wondering why
Had to let the world let it bleed me dry

Uptown Girl,Billy Joel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billyjoel/uptowngirl.html,"Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl

She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man

I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes

You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that
Likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze a thing or two at night.

It'd make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays
I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you
An accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you don't you go

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, 
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know

Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if its empty it definitely fits the room
And we would too

And my dear dear dear Khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore.

Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. Well, hello

Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part

Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?

Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause its in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I cant do all of my do's and still feel ill

Singing boom-dadadadadadada boom-dadadada
Threw it out the window

Legs like little splinters

Made his wife a widow

Wraith Pinned To The Mist And Other Games,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/wraithpinnedtothemistandothergames.html,"Let's have bizarre celebrations... let's forget who, forget what, forget where
We'll have bizarre celebrations... I'll play the Satyr in Cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica

Let's have bizarre celebrations... let's forget when, forget what, forget how
We'll have bizarre celebrations... we'll play Tristan and Isolde, but make sure I see white sails
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica

Maybe I'll never die, I'll just keep growing younger with you, and you'll grow younger, too
Now it seems too lovely to be true, but I know the best things always do
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica

When we drive in your car
I like where we are here

Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch here

Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers, ""Hello. I've missed you quite terribly.""
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

I like where you sleep
When you sleep next to me
I like where you sleep here

And our cheeks can brush

For Once in My Life,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/foronceinmylife.html,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Oh baby

For once in my life

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who need me

For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
Ooh, baby
For once in my life",1968
Great DJ,The Ting Tings,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tingtings/greatdj.html,"Fed up with your indigestion.
Swallow words one by one.
Folks got high at a quarter to five.
Donât you feel your growing up undone. 

Nothing but the local DJ,
who said he had some songs to play.
What went down from his fooling around
gave hope and a brand new day.

Imagine all the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee
And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
Oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
gotta love the BPM.
When the smoke was all baton
Remembering how this begun.
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
Where the future plays it all night long.

and nothin' but the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee

She combs her hair

Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere

Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair

Penny Lane,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/pennylane.html,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane",1967

I'm just a shot, then we can die

Don't move, time is slow
I say... take me out!

If eyes move this could die
I want you...to take me out!

If you need a light, I'd find a match.

And you take me the way I am.

If you are chilly, here take my sweater.
If your head is aching, I'll make it better.

'Cause I love the way you call me ""baby"".
And you take me the way I am.

And I'll buy you Rogaine when you start losing all your hair.
And sew on patches to all you tear.

'Cause I love you more than I could ever promise.
And you take me the way I am.
You take me the way I am.
You take me the way I am.",2007
A Thousand Miles,Vanessa Carlton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanessacarlton/athousandmiles.html,"Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home-bound

Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

Spaceman,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/spaceman.html,"It started with a low light.
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed,
And then they took my blood type.
It left a strange impression in my head.

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind,
But when they cut me open,
I guess, I changed my mind.

And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name.

And the zipping white light beams,
Disregarding bombs and satellites.

That was the turning point.
That was one lonely night.

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad.
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live.
You know it's gonna haunt me.
So hesitation to this life I give.

You think you might cross over.
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.
You better look it over
Before you make that leap.

And you know I'm fine,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes.
They justify my claim.

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised.

But it was the turning point.
Oh, what a lonely night!

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad.
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down.
It's all in your mind.""

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad.
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down.
It's all in your mind.""

My global-position systems are vocally addressed.
They say the Nile used to run from East to West,
They say the Nile used to run from East to West.

I'm fine,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes.

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad.
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down.
It's all in your mind.""

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""

Dancing Queen,ABBA,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/abba/dancingqueen.html,"Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Banana Pancakes,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/bananapancakes.html,"Well can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside...

But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to.
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe, laka ukulele
Momma made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady, love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need, mmm, mmm,
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day, and I don't mind

But the telephone is singing
Ringing
It's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow, mmm mm, wake up slow

But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?

Downtown,Petula Clark,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petulaclark/downtown.html,"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go
Downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know
Downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go
Downtown
Things will be great when you're
Downtown
No finer place for sure
Downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows
Downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close
Downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go
Downtown
Where all the lights are bright
Downtown
Waiting for you tonight
Downtown
You're gonna be alright now
Downtown

Downtown
Downtown

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

So go
Downtown
Things will be great when you're
Downtown
Don't wait a minute more
Downtown
Everything is waiting for you

Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down

Mr. Jones,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/mrjones.html,"I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Oh, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody love me,
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""

I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television,
I wanna see me staring right back at me

We all want to be big stars,
But we don't know why
And we don't know how
But when everybody love me,
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars",1993
I'd Rather Dance With You,Kings of Convenience,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kingsofconvenience/idratherdancewithyou.html,"I'd rather dance with you
than talk with you,
so why don't we just move into the other room.
There's space for us to shake,
and 'hey, I like this tune'.

Even if I could hear what you said,
I doubt my reply would be interesting
for you to hear.
Because I haven't read a single book all year,
and the only film I saw,
I didn't like it at all.

I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.

The music's too loud
and the noise from the crowd
increases the chance of misinterpretation.
So let your hips do the talking.
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings,
and you'll make me smile by really Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.

You And I Both,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/youandiboth.html,"Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
But often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love.

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now,
Oh love, no
You and I, you and I
Not so little you and I anymore, mmm...
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally deedeedeedee
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well I'm free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh just remember the telephone works both ways
And if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
Cause I'll remember everything you sang

Cause you and I both loved what you and I spoke of
and others just read of and if you could see me now
well then I'm almost finally out of.
I'm finally out of, finally, deedeeededede

On the Radio,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/ontheradio.html,"This is how it works
It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

On the radio
We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was asleep

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

And on the radio
You hear November Rain
That solo's awful long
But it's a good refrain
You listen to it twice

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention

I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?

Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow

With dead poets and drum machine

But I couldn't find a killer hook

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends",1967
Whistle for the Choir,The Fratellis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fratellis/whistleforthechoir.html,"Well it's a big big city and it's always the same
Can never be too pretty tell me your name
Is it out of line if I was to be bold to say ""Would you be mine""?

Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen
I know I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream
Though it's 3 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk.

So if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye,
A girl like you's just irresistible

Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out
But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces
And my head's a mess
And it's 4 in the morning, and I'm walking along
Beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong
And it's you, woo hoo
That's got me going crazy for the things you do

So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me
But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
And only a girl like you could be lonely
And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
A boy like me's just irresistible

So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try oh my, you caught my eye
A girl like you's just irresistible",2006
Lovely Rita,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/lovelyrita.html,"Aaaahhh...

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita, maid, ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid, Rita meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh Lovely Rita meter meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Ah da, ah da (Lovely Rita meter maid)

Good Life,OneRepublic,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/onerepublic/goodlife.html,"Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

Hopelessly
I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight

My Rollercoaster,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/myrollercoaster.html,"You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
And if home is really where the heart is
Then we're the smartest kids I know
Because wherever we are in this great big world
We'll never be more than a few hours from home... 

And that's important because I need to travel
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And before I had a mini van I road the greyhound bus
My mom would say ""i hope some day you get paid for being kimya dawson"" 

And now I do and it's not much
But it's enough
I've got my scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy 

On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again 

From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be do do do do do do
I'll be the greatest man of your life 

'cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes
And playing video games in the middle of the night
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride it'll be out of sight
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Four five six seven minutes in the closet 

You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
You know just when to jump off
You're so brave
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight 

Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
As long as it keeps goin' round it's unbelievable

they don't come much more sick than you
I could go on if you want me to
it's just so wrong so very nice I told you
once and you killed me twice
I saw you one time at the back of the
club chewing on glass and a ticket stub
I heard they kicked the boy till he bled
then stood and said oh my god till she said

everybody knows you're the one to call
when the girls get ugly at the back of the wall
Josephine says you got a bleeding nose
so taking it with her wherever she goes

well hers is a tonic and mine is a gin
they don't come much more slick
than you I'd drive your car if you ask me to

Wild cards, men from Mars
Dressed in stars and stripes
Eclectic Electric
Ladies at the evenin
Drinkin booze and mingilin
Mashin through the music
I can do anything
Freaky deaky, star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I found paradise
Iâm seein stars, I canât believe my eyes
Iâm seein stars

And it feels so good, so good

The coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be a sparkle one night, thatâs right

Feel the rush, feel the spice of life
Thug life
Shifty rolls the dice
Snake eyed surprise

A Sentence Of Sorts In Kongsvinger,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/asentenceofsortsinkongsvinger.html,"I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in Norway
I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
Just slept way too much, just slept

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me

I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
While trying to restructure my character
Because it had become vile to its creator
And through many dreadful nights
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
And waiting for some high times to come again

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me

Dirty old shadow, stay away
Don't play your games with me
I am older now, I see the way you operate
If you don't hurt me then you die

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side

It's just verbosity to me",2007

The Way We Get By,Spoon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/spoon/thewaywegetby.html,"We get high in back seats of cars
We break into mobile homes
We go to sleep to shake appeal
Never wake up on our own

And that's the way we get by

We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to some weird sin
We seek out the taciturn

That's the way we get by

We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

And that's the way to my heart
That's the way we get by
We get high in back seats of cars
We put faith in our concerns
Fall in love to down on the street
We believe in the sum of ourselves

Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walked to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes I can tell that we are gonna be friends.",2001

Two kids, a dog and then a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan

He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he'd newly found
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound

Don't let the stars get you down.
Don't let the waves let you drown.
Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Oh Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go.
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind.
Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind.

And on his journey and his travels on the way,
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say,
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind.
Oh Billy Brown you are a victim of the times.

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Don't let the stars get you down.
Don't let the waves let you drown.
Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life.
Two kids, a dog and then a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man",2007

I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes I am falling

The Lovecats,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/thelovecats.html,"We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss

We slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night

Let's go
And throw
All the songs we know

Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Better Together,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/bettertogether.html,"There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams,
And they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer.
At least for most of the questions in my heart.
Like: ""Why are we here?"", ""And where do we go?"",
""And how come it's so hard?"".
It's not always easy,
And sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing:
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do

But if all of these dreams
Might find their way into my day-to-day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

Mmm, mmm, mmm

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time,
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together.",2005

An alley cat chewing on dead leaves
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

When I leave, I try not to wake her
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
In the morning

She wrote my name on a red telephone box
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

And all this time I've watched it change
But it's still the same

Father FÃ¼hrer, don't be mad at me
Peasant child, you're into botany
Splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
""Beware"", the sign on the door suggests
I'm better off with artificial intelligence

I invented you
I invented you
And I will destroy you

If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend
Like a robot

Well, if a leopard doesn't change it's spots
You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I swap the bruising for a bumping sensation
I'll be Ctrl-Alt-deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting
Singing ""I'm not finished, I'm not finished, no!""

Mistaking cables for veins can be quite misleading
Friction sparks from metal made it look like bleeding

And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They remind me of when we were in school,
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact nothing really mattered at all

And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down!
I'm just thankful to be facing the day.
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone.

It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones shake and ring
One of those was someone who knew you

And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They'll still remind me of when we were in school
When they could never have persuaded me,
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools

Well let them take you next!

Hot Air Balloon,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/hotairballoon.html,"We wrote a prelude to our own fairytale
And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale.
And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.

We round a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs.
I lit a match and let it catch to light up the room.
And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon.

Hot air balloon.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

We drank the Great Lakes like cold lemonade.
And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade.
So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.
You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.

You Make My Dreams,Hall & Oates,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/halloates/youmakemydreams.html,"What I want you've got
And it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Oh, yeah

Come true
(You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cos I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same

I Don't Feel Like Dancin',Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/idontfeellikedancin.html,"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what you done?'
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one.
You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns.
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile.
You got so many colours, make a blind man so confused.
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So, I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
So, please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound.
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light.

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'

Henrietta,The Fratellis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fratellis/henrietta.html,"Henrietta we got no flowers for you
Just these three miserable cunts
sitting on the back seat
banging on the off beat
we know you love us and you probably do
although your husband may cut us
he is an animal
though everything is possible

give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
it's hard to miss you when you follow us about
buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
we'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

And it's
clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
you can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
these are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on...

Dear Henrietta we're just three lonely boys
Though the girls love us we're so
into you incredibly
we'd love to see you terribly
we'd love to hate you but we don 't have no choice
come be our wa ha ha ha
honey, honey three four one time once more

give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
it's hard to miss you when you follow us about
buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
we'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

Just My Imagination,The Cranberries,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cranberries/justmyimagination.html,"There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were living for the love we had and
Living not for reality

It was just my imagination [x3]

There was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable

It was just my imagination [x3]

There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday

What I Got,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/whatigot.html,"Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot

Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity
Love is what I got
It's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served
Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got

(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I got I got I got",1996
One Day Like This,elbow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elbow/onedaylikethis.html,"Drinking in the morning sun
Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off a heavy one
Yeah, heavy like a loaded gun

What made me behave that way?
Using words I never say
I can only think it must be love
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight

'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

When my face is chamois creased
If you think I wink, I did
Laugh politely at repeats
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin

'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

So throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right for life

Throw those curtains wide

Stuck in the Middle,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/stuckinthemiddle.html,"I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
Your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
Care to see my reason?
Care to put your life in mine?

Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Who's learned to love you but has also learned to grow
Could we make it better, stormy weather?
It's so hard to know!

Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?
Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home
Who wants to have me, just to love me?
Stuck in the middle

I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
But my troops are bigger than yours
You'll never stand my fight

Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one
Who doesn't like to be gone?

Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?
Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home
Who wants to have me, just to love me?
Stuck in the middle

Yeah, yeah, yeah

This is who I am
This ain't a greater plan to break your heart on me
I know that what I've started means that when we have parted
I can live in honesty

Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?

Denial,Sugababes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugababes/denial.html,"Somewhere in the back of my mind 
Secretly I know you will find 
Me amongst the blushing and glow 
Deep beyond the things I don't show 

Mystery's a beautiful thing 
What a gift a woman can bring 
Never let it out just like that 
Let him slowly figure it out 

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day? 
And at night 
You gotta let the water drain in 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror

You were like a power of nature 
Telepathic beautiful creature 
Understanding all of my weakness 
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it 

Cynical and hurt was just me 
You were never supposed to be 
Part of what I would call amazing 
Took so long to finally see 

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day? 
And at night 
You gotta let the water drain in 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew

Like open minds for us 
No complicated barriers 
To hold us back

I didn't wanna know the things I knew

Shine On,The Kooks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kooks/shineon.html,"Safety pins holding up the things

About your hair, you needn't care,
You look beautiful all the time.

Shine, shine, shine on

Wont you shine, shine on

Your magazines, at people at the seams
But you still read
I must admit, I don't believe in it
But I see how you get sucked in

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Wont you shine, shine on

Shine, shine, shine on

Why do you bite the hand that feeds you
Why do you
Why do you bite the hand that feeds...you!

Good Day,Nappy Roots,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nappyroots/goodday.html,"Let's begin now

Know today, I woke up this morning, and I said
You know, instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around, through ups and downs, waitin' on somethin' to happen
I just said...

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good, change the colors to my phone
Orange Kool-Aid go good with Patron
Oh no, hell no, boy is still my ring tone
Free car wash, had to clean up the Dodge
Give back when I can, just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry, mustard, hot sauce
Light bread and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bop
Last night, hit the pick three, bought some Air Force Ones
Four tall tees, man I'm loving B.G.

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Fish Scales:]
And I ain't finna worry 'bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground, and that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up, now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks, say I'm headed their way
Heard my cousin cookin' out, I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit, ain't even out in the States
So if I ain't speakin' too soon, but this a hell of a day
And this sticky got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My new grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm A-ok

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Skinny DeVille:]
We might as well do exactly what the children sayin'
Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few, and put up your deuce
If it's beef, put down the peace down, throw up your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your â
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind
Forever and a day, the choice you make is really all fine

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day",2008

Hustlers grab your guns
Your shadow weighs a ton
Driving down the 101

Right back where we started from

California, here we come!

On the stereo
Listen as we go
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Right back where we started from

Pedal to the floor
Thinkin' of the roar
Gotta get us to the show

Put your circuits in the sea

Making electricity

Oh you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world

I'm a Believer,Smash Mouth,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashmouth/imabeliever.html,"I thought love was
Only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else
But not for me

Love was out to get me

Disappointment haunted
All my dreams

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
But the more I gave the less I got, oh yeah

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face

Of doubt in my mind

Never Let You Go,Third Eye Blind,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thirdeyeblind/neverletyougo.html,"There's every good reason for letting you go 
She's sneaky and smoked out 
And it's starting to show

But even if I changed 
What's wrong with it?

And all the time moves on and on 
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong 
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong 
If there's a reason, it's lost on me 
Maybe we'll be friends, I guess we'll see

The mood rings, the bracelets and the beads 
Nickels and dimes, yours and mine 
Did you cash in all your dreams 
You don't dream for me no, you don't dream for me no

That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save

Doing the Unstuck,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/doingtheunstuck.html,"It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges
Boats
And other dreary worlds you know
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile without a doubt
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump and sing and shout
Let's get happy!

But it's much to late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
For rip-zipping button-popping kiss and well...
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
And you don't give a further thought
To things like feet
Let's get happy!

But it's much too late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never to late
To get up and go

Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house!
Burn down the street!
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye

It's a perfect day for getting wild
Forgetting all your worries
Life
And everything that makes you cry
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
For thinking big
And doing anything you want to do
Let's get happy!

But it's much to late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house!
Burn down the street!
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye",1992
1901,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/1901.html,"Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present they donât matter
Now the futureâs sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think itâs not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldnât tell how to fall out

Itâs twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know itâs easy
Like we did it over summer long

And Iâll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Itâs not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldnât let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think itâs not gonna stay anyway
I think itâs overrated
For a minute thought I couldnât tell how to fall out

Itâs twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know itâs easy
Like we did it over summer long

And Iâll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Itâs not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldnât let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it",2009
So Much Love,The Rocket Summer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rocketsummer/somuchlove.html,"Hats need a beat, like awake needs asleep
Like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake

Oh, yeah

Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs the time
Like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back

Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it
Oh, I can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh, my soul has never had this feeling
and it feels like gold

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true

Strike all the bells, hit 'em hard make 'em all yell
Celebrate, infatuate, lock us up yeah incarcerate oh!

Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it
Oh, I can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh, my soul has never had this feeling
and it feels like so, so

So much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true

You got so much love in you

Life Is Wonderful,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/lifeiswonderful.html,"It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a storey
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying

It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
It takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

La la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Al la la la la

It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other

And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
It takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished

Ha la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is so full of
Ah la la la la la la life is so rough
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is our love
Ah la la la la la

It takes some silence to make sound
It takes a loss before you found it
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain

Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life is meaningful
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life it is...so... wonderful
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful
It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
Wonderful",2005
Born to Run,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/borntorun.html,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines

Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby, we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider

But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide

Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 

And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Come on, Wendy, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Ru-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Uh-uh-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-un",1975
Today,The Smashing Pumpkins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashingpumpkins/today.html,"Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out 

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've never known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known",1993
The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/clapyourhandssayyeah/theskinofmyyellowcountryteeth.html,"Once - The dogs have quit their barking
""Son,"" - my neighbor said to me.
""Know the emptiness of talking blue
the same old sheep.""
Run - I'll do no more this walking
Haunted by a past I just can't see
Anymore
Anymore

But let me tell you I have never planned
To let go of the hand that has been 
Clinging by its thick country skin
To my yellow country teeth

Far - Far away from West Virginia
I - Will try on New York City
Explaining that the sky holds the
Wind the sun rushes in and a child
With a shotgun can shoot down
Honeybees that sting
BUT THIS BOY COULD USE A LITTLE STING!

Who - Will get me to a party?
Who - Do I have yet to meet?
You - You look a bit like coffee
And you taste a bit like me
How - Can I keep me from moving?
Now - I need a change of scenery
Just listen to me I won't pretend to
Understand the movement of the wind
Or the waves out in the ocean or how
Like the hours I change softly slowly
Plainly blindly oh me oh my!",2005
