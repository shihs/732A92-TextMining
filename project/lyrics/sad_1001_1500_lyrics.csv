Last Flowers,Radiohead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiohead/lastflowers.html,"Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful",2007
Somewhere In My Broken Heart,Billy Dean,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billydean/somewhereinmybrokenheart.html,"You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly, go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken heart

Girl, I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see 
It's somewhere in my broken
Somewhere in my broken
Somewhere in my broken heart",1990
When It Rains,Paramore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paramore/whenitrains.html,"And when it rains
On this side of town it touches, everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing
You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that
It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

And when it rains
You always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything
You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep 'til May
And you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
And no, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around (take your time)
Take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (take my...)
Just turn it around

No, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No, oh I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

You could take your time
Take my time",2007
Here Comes Goodbye,Rascal Flatts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rascalflatts/herecomesgoodbye.html,"I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And its not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain 
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain 
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

Oh-oooo

Here comes goodbye 
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain 
Here comes me wishing things had never changed

Tryin' to fight the hurt tryin' to hide the shame baby

I Can't Unlove You,Kenny Rogers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennyrogers/icantunloveyou.html,"Postcards and letters
And pictures made to last forever
To be boxed up and tossed away
Knickknacks and souvenirs
In an afternoon, they're out of here
They'll disappear without a trace
But what they mean to me
Can never be replaced

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Interstates and old songs
Like time they go on and on
I guess I could learn to do the same
I could wake up without you
These two arms not around you
Tell myself it's meant to be this way
No matter how I try somethings I can't change

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, no
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Everything my heart's been through

Oh, oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you",2006
Run Joey Run,Glee Cast,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gleecast/runjoeyrun.html,"Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, ""Joe, don't come over
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door

I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done, he's got a gun
So run, Joey run, Joey run!""

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Got in my car, drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me, with tear-filled eyes
And bruises on her face

All at once I saw him there
Sneakin' up behind me (Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, ""He's got a gun!""
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling
I ran to her, I held her close
When I looked down, my hands were red!
And here's the last words Julie said...

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gon...na get... mar...ried...

Tear,The Smashing Pumpkins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashingpumpkins/tear.html,"The lights came on fast 
Lost in motorcrash 
Gone in a flash unreal 
But you knew all along 
You laugh the light 
I sing the songs 
To watch you numb 

I saw you there 
You were on your way 
You held the rain 
And for the first time 
Heaven seemed insane 
Cause heaven is to blame 
For taking you away 

Do you know the way that I can? 
Do you know the way that I can't lose? 
Do you know the things that I can? 
Do you know the things that I can do? 

Where is your heart? where is your heart gone to? 
Tear me apart 
Tear me apart from you 
You laugh the light I cry the wound 
In gray afternoons 

I saw you there 
You were on your way 
You held the rain 
And for the first time 
Heaven seemed insane 
Cause heaven is to blame 
For taking you away 

The lights came to pass 
Dead opera motorcrash 
Gone in a flash unreal 
In nitrous overcast 

Do you know the way that I can? 
Do you know the way that I can't choose? 
Do you know the things that I can? 
Do you know the things that I can't lose? 

Tear me apart 
Tear me apart from you 
Where is your heart? 
Where has your heart run to?",1998
Ghost in This House,Alison Krauss,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alisonkrauss/ghostinthishouse.html,"I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage
Heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
And took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
Oh, I'm just a ghost in this house",1999
Harder Now That It's Over,Ryan Adams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ryanadams/hardernowthatitsover.html,"They slapped 'em on you 
Where that bracelet used to be 
You know the one I bought you in phoenix 
Where they sell old jewelry 
I was trying to make you angry 
But I didn't feed you to the cops 
When I threw that drink in that guy's face 
It was just to piss you off 
'Cause honey it's over 

It's harder now that it's over 
It's harder now that it's over 
Now that the cuffs are off 
And you're free 
You're free with a history

Must've felt just like old times 
I wish you would've grabbed the gun 
And shot me 'cause I died 
And I'm nothing now without you 
yeah, I'm less than nothing now 

I'm the one between the bars and lost forever now 
'Cause it's over now 

It's harder now that it's over 
It's harder now that it's over

That keeps me trusting

Take me deeper now

Book of Saturday,King Crimson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kingcrimson/bookofsaturday.html,"If I only could deceive you
Forgetting the game
Every time I try to leave you
You laugh just the same

'Cause my wheels never touch the road
And the jumble of lies we told
Just returns to my back to weigh me down...

We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band

Reminiscences gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds...

All completeness in the morning
Asleep on your side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride

She responds like a limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
To the shuddering breath of yesterday...

There's the succour of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams

As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favour of making sweet sixteen...

You make my life and times
A book of bluesy Saturdays
And I have to choose...",1973
Where Will You Go,Babyface,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/babyface/wherewillyougo.html,"We started out simple friends
That kind of friendship never ends, no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray

Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do

What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away

In time my love
You were thinkin' that our love was gonna stray

And who, who's gonna love you baby
The way that I do, now baby
Where, where will you go, where will you go

Maybe I'm just hallucinating
Cause my loneliness got the best of me

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what's his face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago

It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless

Running to spring

Watch her run with ribbons undone

She's a rose in a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right there will be time
To chase the sun with ribbons undone

She runs like a fire does
Just picking up daises
Comes in for a landing
A pure flash of lightening
Past alice blue blossoms
You follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you
Arms filled with lavender

Yes my little pony is growing up fast
She corrects me and says
""You mean a thoroughbred""
A look in her eyes says the battle's beginning
From school she comes home and cries
I don't want to grow up Mom at last not tonight

You're a girl
Rising from a shell
Running through spring
With summer's hand in reach now
It is your time
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
It is your time yes my angel
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone

Run run darlin'

Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanjackson/wherewereyouwhentheworldstoppedturning.html,"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?

Did you stand there in shock
At the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger
In fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?

Did you burst out with pride
For the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died
Just doin' what they do?

Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?

Did you feel guilty
'Cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother
And tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?

Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

Without You Here,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/withoutyouhere.html,"Your love's a gathered storm I chased across the sky
A moment in your arms became the reason why
And you're still the only light that fills the emptiness
The only one I need until my dying breath
And I would give you everything just to
Feel your open arms
And I'm not sure I believe anything I feel

And now, now that you're near
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

And I'm trying to believe
In things that I don't know
The turning of the world
The color of your soul
That love could kill the pain
Truth is never vain
It turns strangers into lovers
And enemies to brothers
Just say you understand
I never had this planned

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here
Without you here
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

My head lies to my heart 
And my heart it still believes
It seems the ones who love us are the ones
That we deceive
But you're changing everything
You're changing everything in me

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here",2006

Call me anything but your own
I don't mind, I don't mind

I don't care if you leave me
I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this
I don't mind

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

So where in the world, where in the world,
Where in the world can I hide this hurt,
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind

If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brand new ride
But babe please don't tell me so

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

Break it up, just break it up",1996
The Forgotten,Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/theforgotten.html,"Where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Theyâre lost inside your memory
Youâre dragging on, your heartâs been broken
As we all go down in history

Where in the world did the time go?
Itâs where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Well donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen

I donât feel strange, itâs more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I canât quite put my finger on it
But itâs like a child that was left behind

So where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love",2012
If You're Reading This,Tim McGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timmcgraw/ifyourereadingthis.html,"If you're reading this
My Mommas sitting there
Looks like I only got a one way ticket over here
Sure wish I
Could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

[Chorus:]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my Momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
Half way around the world
I wonât be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stands up for the innocent and the weak

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

[Chorus]

If you're reading this
Thereâs going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find some one else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

[Chorus]",2007
All at Once,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/allatonce.html,"All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

[Chorus:]
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

[Chorus]",1985
Living Proof,Ricky Van Shelton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickyvanshelton/livingproof.html,"She hangs up the phone and her heart starts to pound
Someone just told her an old friend's in town
And a million old feelings come rushing in
Start tearing to pieces what it took years to mend

She's living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
She just can't forget it, Lord knows, she's tried
She's living proof, true love never dies

You answer the door and I say, ""Hello""
If you don't want to see me, just tell me, I'll go
But I can't love without you, it's only pretend
There's no love like you're sweet love, can we try it again?

We're living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
I just can't forget you, Lord knows, I've tried
We're living proof, true love never dies
Yes, we're living proof, true love never dies",1988
She Don't Want the World,3 Doors Down,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/3doorsdown/shedontwanttheworld.html,"The open wound she hides
She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
And that's ok, she don't want the world

All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
And that's ok, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

Those words he never spoke
Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more
But it's ok, she don't want the world

Softly in her sleep
Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear
She just smiles, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
And it's ok, she don't want the world",2008
How Could an Angel Break My Heart,Toni Braxton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/howcouldanangelbreakmyheart.html,"I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine

I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name

I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Oh, my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
My heart",1996
Feel The Silence,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/feelthesilence.html,"You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry
All you remember now
Is what you feel

The truth remains
In midnight conversations
I asked for this moment
But you turned away

Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain

And you remain
A promise unfulfilled
I ask you for more
But you push me away

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside us
Looking for something more to say
I don't know where I'm going
Only know where I been
But you move through my soul like a hurricane wind
We've been so lost for so long
I don't know how to get back again 
And we're drowning in the water
That flows under this bridge
When you're fighting the current
You forget how to live
And I wanted to reach you but I don't know where to begin
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled until today

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain
And if we feel the silence
Leaving this all behind us
When it's gone what will you say

How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on

You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry",2006
Little Miss Perfect,Sugababes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugababes/littlemissperfect.html,"Iâm the most responsible girl that I know
Never late, always on time for the show
Ask anyone around me
And theyâll tell you just how I am, yeah

I try to tell the truth every chance that I get
I never let the work Iâm doing get to my head
And when it came to love
I thought I gave it the best I had, yeah

But somewhere I missed, somewhere I slipped
Somewhere, thereâs a couple steps that I skipped
Somehow, I told myself I didnât need anyone

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone
Now, itâs so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that âLittle Miss Perfectâ
Wasnât that perfect after all

Now everything around me
Feels out of place
Like all four walls are closing in
And thereâs no escape

Everyday spent without you
It gets harder to act like Iâm okay
If I could take back the things that I said
If I could un-break all that we had
Iâd put all the pieces back together again

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone
Now, itâs so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that âLittle Miss Perfectâ
Wasnât that perfect after all

The world that I know is all crashing down
And itâs the biggest shock to me
âCause I thought I had it all figured out
So, why does my heart feel empty?
Oh

I thought it was perfect
But it wasnât so perfect

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone
Now, itâs so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that âLittle Miss Perfectâ
Wasnât that perfect after all",2010
The Way Down,The White Tie Affair,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitetieaffair/thewaydown.html,"You know reactions speak louder than words.
Thought we were past that,
forget what you heard.
Pay no attention.
Better to shut out the light,
than to find yourself at home all alone
thinkin' of me tonight.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere
and I don't think we'll survive.

A fall from up so high,
the tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Everything was perfect,
till the train went right off the rail.
Like we were passed out,
asleep at the wheel.
When you know you've lost it,
there's no one in control.
And you will find yourself too high.
Better just try letting go.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere
and I don't think we'll survive.

A fall from up so high,
the tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Now that the smoke is gone,
I can see that I'm all alone.
Forever has been long enough.
I need you to come back home.

The tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

We're on the way...
We're on the way...
We're on the way...",2008
Love Hurts,Jon B.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonb/lovehurts.html,"Sometimes love can feel
Like the closest thing to heaven
Sometimes love can feel
Like you've been run over by a car
Yes it can it's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you dowm on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
Cause love can sure hurt sometimes

[Chorus:]
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
Love hurts and it don't

Some people will tell you
It's the best thing for the heart
Yes they will what they fail to tell you
It can tear your life apart
But you know it's as sweet as a summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing, everybody sing

[Chorus:]
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't

[Bridge:]
When you know that you're alive
Cause you feel so much pain
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to say
Then you know, yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't

[Chorus:]
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't

If You Want Me To,Joe Diffie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joediffie/ifyouwantmeto.html,"Darlin' I'll pack up my clothes
Take my heart on down the road
I'll even make believe I don't love you.

Lose my mind, go insane, turn my face to the pourin' rain
There's nothin' I wouldn't do if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

If there's no way to make it work
I'll find a way to hide the hurt 
I'll do my best to do what's best for you.

I'll just take your memory and disappear quietly
Quit acting like a fool if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

Ohh if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.",1990

[English translation:]

Oh woah...

A girl like you is such a confusing set
Of questions and answers
So I shut my mouth
I bury love inside the farewell
Outside the window, the forgotten rain and wind blows
In the wee hours of the night
I hear familiar songs from the radio
It's perfect for thinking about you
There are two empty cups of coffee
In this place without you, I fight with loneliness

I walk alone on the streets
I go to the cafe I used to go a lot, I go watch a movie

I lock even myself in the memories, how about you?
This weather, this temperature
This passing wind, will I remember it?
A person to be forgotten
Like a passing by black and white film
I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
(I draw you with a pencil, I erase you
With an eraser that is the falling rain)
Oh woah...
(I draw you out again today
Will I be able to erase you?)

A bright red umbrella
Wet and drenched clothes and sneakers
I turn off and turn on the boiler
Whatever I do, it doesn't dry
Is that how I feel or is it not?
A confusing set of questions and answers

On a rainy day, I fell for you
We used to love
Each other so much
It didn't seem like we had to do this
So my heart hurts so much (heart hurts)
(From the beginning, I held you in the left side
Of my heart and you thickly remain)
Now you remain as a broken fragment
That's deeply engraved inside
You pull me in
I think I lied when I said I could live without you
I throw away my feelings
But I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Dear sky, please help me
Please stop this rain
So that I can forget her, oh no

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
Outside the window
The sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days, I miss you and our kiss
Oh woah...
Outside the window, the sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days
I always run into you",P:  
Pictures of Me,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/picturesofme.html,"Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease

Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op TV
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong

You go walking by
Here come another guy
Jailer who sells
Personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me

Change Is Hard,She & Him,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shehim/changeishard.html,"I'm all out of luck

Could I be?
I know he's yours

To me again

I did him wrong
So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know

So I'll keep my head down
If you keep it quiet from now on
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Than the bells of new love

So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try

Welcome Home,Radical Face,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radicalface/welcomehome.html,"Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun, and the days blur into one
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done

Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much, but we've made the most
Welcome home

Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost

Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I've come home

All my nightmares escape my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs
I feel your thumbs
Press into my skin again",2007

In spite of these comforting sounds
You make
I don't feel alright
Because you make promises
That you break
Into your house
Why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
It's hard to make sense
Feels as if I'm sensing you
Through a lens
If someone else comes
I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude
And probably you know
All the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it
Honestly
Back when we were kids
We would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are
Messing up
Nobody has gained or
Accomplished anything",2000
I'll Wait for You,Joe Nichols,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joenichols/illwaitforyou.html,"The snow in Montana was three feet high
Lady at the counter said,
""There ain't no flights""
So he called her on the telephone,
He said I'll rent a car
And I'll drive home.

She said,
I'll wait for you like I did last year
At Christmas time with you family here,
And your truck broke down
Out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped
Till you got home,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

Now he's on his cell phone
In a Coupe deVille
Talking to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breaking
Cause she's there alone
Her heart is aching
Cause she wants him home

She says i'll wait for you
Like in '68 when our child was due
I said It will have to wait
Until his dad gets here,
And stands by my side,
Remember dear our son's first cry.
Soh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

He didn't stop all day
To eat a bite,
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said she's in a better place
She said to give you this note,
Just in case.

And it said I'll wait for you
At heaven's gate,
Oh I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell St. Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

P.S. I love you too
Sweatheart I'll wait for you...",2005
He Stopped Loving Her Today,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/hestoppedlovinghertoday.html,"He said, ""I'll love you till I die""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy, now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today",1980
Years,Barbara Mandrell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barbaramandrell/years.html,"Faded photographs
The feelings all come back
Even now sometimes
You feel so near
And I still see your face
Like it was yesterday
It's strange how the days turned into years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

Nighttime gently falls
Another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

After all these years...",1979
Days Like These,Janis Ian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisian/dayslikethese.html,"On days like these
When the rain won't fall
And the sky is so dry
That even birds can't call
I can feel your tears
Disappearing in the air
Carried on the breeze
On days like these

It's years like these
That make a young man old
Bend his back against the promises
That life should hold
They can make him wise
They can drive him to his knees
Nothing comes for free
On days like these

But you can't reap what you don't sow
And you can't plant in fallow ground
So let us fill this empty earth with hope
Until the rains come down

In lives like these
Where every moment counts
I add up all the things
That I can live without
When the one thing left
Is the blessing of my dreams
I can make my peace
With days like these

I can make my peace
With days like these",2000

Is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue
Is always there

The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love, baby

Emptiness
Is a place you're in
With nothing to lose
But no more to win

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love

Lonely
Without you baby
Girl I need you
I can't go on

The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky

Till It Happens to You,Corinne Bailey Rae,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/corinnebaileyrae/tillithappenstoyou.html,"I know what I said
Was heat of the moment
But theres a little truth in between the words we've spoken
Its a little late now to fix the heart thats broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going
Cause I don't know
No I don't know anymore

It used to feel like heaven
Used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But you wont believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same now when I'm with you
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen
When our love was new
Oooh love I'm a fool to believe in you
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
Anymore

It used to feel like heaven
It used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth
Until their hearts broken
Don't you dare tell them
What you think to do
Till they get over
You can only learn these things
From experience
When you get older
I just wish that someone would have told me
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you",2006

And I can't even get inside to talk you down
Peter, sweet baby, where'd you get that gun?
You spend half your life trying to turn the other half around

And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use
Your face is all over six o'clock news
They cleared the street and then they closed the schools
I can't even get inside

Did you lose your head when the farm went down?
Was is when your daddy died after he moved to town
And I know your momma calls you good for nothing
She says her baby is a failer and she don't want you calling

Peter, sweet baby, there's something I need to say to you
Gonna have your baby this coming June
We could get a little place down by Gilmour park
You could do a little time and save my broken heart

Now you're lying dead on the avenue

Next to the grocery list

It said, you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do you care if I go

He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldn't remember what for
So he said I've been doing some thinking
I've been thinking that maybe you're right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,
the frozen smiles to chase love away.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna rain today.

Lonely, lonely.
Tin can at my feet,
I think I'll kick it down the street.
That's the way to treat a friend.

Right before me the signs implore me:
Help the needy and show them the way.

The Point of It All,Amanda Palmer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amandapalmer/thepointofitall.html,"Oh, what a noble, distinguished collection of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again: no we'll wait, no we promise, we'll wait
June makes these excellent sewing machines out of common industrial waste
She spends a few days at a time on the couch but she says
She wears shades, she wears shades

But no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
And you're learning that just 'cause they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call...

They made the comment in jest
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all

Maybe a week in the tropics would help to remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on a deck with a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple weeks later we came back and you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet
Eyes fixed to the place where the dryer had been

Oh, but no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
Why on earth would I keep you propped up in here when you so love the fall...?

The pattern's laid out on the bed
With dozens of colors of thread
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point in the end

But it's better to waste your day watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
Than to put yourself in it and turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
But while you were sleeping some men came around
Said they had some dimensions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about but they sure made a mess of your face

But still, no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for playing along
You're almost human, even now

And just 'cause they call themselves experts
It doesn't mean sweet fuck all...
They've got the permanent press
Homes with a stable address

And they've got excitement
And life by the fistful
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all",2008

An endless aching need""

That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",ound

So they put a rifle in my hand

I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone

He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery

How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds

Sylvia's mother says, 'Sylvia's packin'
She's gonna be leavin' today'
Sylvia's mother says, 'Sylvia's marryin'
A fella down Galveston way'
Sylvia's mother says, 'Please don't say nothin'
To make her start cryin' and stay'

And the operator says, '40 cents more for the next 3 minutes'
Please Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her a while
Please Mrs. Avery, I just wanna tell 'er goodbye

Sylvia's mother says, 'Sylvia's hurryin'
She's catchin' the nine o'clock train'
Sylvia's mother says, 'Take your umbrella
Cause Sylvie, it's startin' to rain'
And Sylvia's mother says, 'Thank you for callin'
And, sir, won't you call back again?'

And the operator says, '40 cents more for the next 3 minutes'
Please Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her a while
Please Mrs. Avery, I just wanna tell 'er goodbye

Tell her goodbye

Please
Tell her goodbye",1971
The Most Beautiful Girl,Charlie Rich,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/charlierich/themostbeautifulgirl.html,"Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?",1973
Second Chance,Shinedown,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shinedown/secondchance.html,"My eyes are open wide
By the way
I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way
I'm leaving out today

I just saw Halley's comet
She waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid
Of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close
It's only for today

I just saw Halley's comet
She waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Here's my chance
This is my chance

Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance",2008
What About Now,Daughtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daughtry/whataboutnow.html,"Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
But are not saying
Can we see beyond the stars
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love, it never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far
Just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life
I am yours

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What about now?
What about today?

This Boy,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/thisboy.html,"That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

The Only One,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/theonlyone.html,"You know you're not the only one
When they all come crashing down, midflight,
You know you're not the only one.
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life.
You know you're not the only one.

We're all grieving,
Lost and bleeding.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me.

So afraid to open your eyes, hypnotized.
You know you're not the only one
Never understood this life.
And you're right, I don't deserve
But you know I'm not the only one.

We're all grieving,
Lost and bleeding.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me.

Don't look down,
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you.
Don't look down, you'll fall down,
You'll become their sacrifice.

Right or wrong.
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you.
If I can't feel, I'm not mine,
I'm not real.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing,
Heaven shine a light down on me.",2006
Cold as You,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/coldasyou.html,"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you",2006
They Won't Go When I Go,George Michael,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgemichael/theywontgowhenigo.html,"No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when i go

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him i'll bide
Because they won't go when i go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
They won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
They won't go when i go

Since my soul conceived 
All that i believe
The kingdom i will see
'Cause they won't go when i go

When i go
Where i'll go
No one can keep me
From my destiny",1990
The Love Thieves,Depeche Mode,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/depechemode/thelovethieves.html,"Oh the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With all their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their trades
But they'll always be failures

Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirits shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as adam is eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers",1997
Nothing to Give,White Lies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitelies/nothingtogive.html,"You talked me to sleep last night
I hadn't felt that sad in years
Your eyes like glass mistakes
They moved me close to tears
You speak those favorite fables
Which I am yet to live
And casually confirm my fears
That I've got nothing to give

I wish I could say
That I've got no regrets
But saying that would be one more
To pile on my desk
I wish I could say I've clung to time like gold
But as you said goodbye I almost died
I almost died

I take it back all of it
Those names I called myself
The heroes of my childhood
Like hardbacks on the shelf
I take it back those promises
I made to everyone
I'm falling through a ribbon last
Before I'd learn to run

I wish I could say
That I've got no regrets
But saying that would be one more
To pile on my desk
I wish I could say I've clung to time like gold
But as you said goodbye I almost died
I almost died
I almost died",2009
Love's A Game,The Magic Numbers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/magicnumbers/lovesagame.html,"Oh maybe I think, maybe I donât
Maybe I will, maybe I wonât 
Find my way this time
I hear you calling me soon

One of these days 
Somebody stays and somebody pays
It happens all the time
Iâll be leaving, believing you wanted me to

Maybe Iâm a fool
For walking in line
Maybe I should try to lead this time
Iâm an honest mistake that you make
Did you mean to?
Did you mean
Did you mean 

Love is just a game
Broken all the same
And I will get over you
Love is just a lie
Happens all the time
Swear I know this much is true

And they collared you up
And collared you down
And coloured you in
And Iâve been waiting so long
To take you home

And maybe I think, maybe I donât
Maybe I will, maybe I wonât
Find my way tonight
But I hear you calling me soon

Maybe Iâm a fool
For walking in line
Maybe I should try to lead this time

The End of the World,Skeeter Davis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/skeeterdavis/theendoftheworld.html,"Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's The End of the World
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's The End of the World
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye",

On my wall
On my wall
I think
About you
Often
Often
I can't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

It's funny
But it's true
And it's true
But it's not funny
Time comes and goes
All the while

Some things last a long time

Things that we did
All we forget

This Old House,Loretta Lynn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lorettalynn/thisoldhouse.html,"Oh, if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell
It would tell about the good times
And the bad times as well
It would tell about the love 
That lived and died inside these walls
And the sound of little footsteps 
Runnin' up and down the hall

Oh, if this old house could talk 
It would break my heart in two
I couldn't stand to be reminded 
Of all the things we used to do
There's no love in this old house no more
So I got it up for sale
Why, if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell

Oh, if this old house could talk
I know what it would say
I'm as lonesome as you are
And I feel nonempty everyday
Well, I even miss the babies 
Who built me up to feel this way
Why, if this old house could talk
Lord, I know what it would say

If this old house could talk
What a story it would tell
We built this home together
And with love we drove each nail
Take me in your arms and hold me
'Cause we've been apart too long
Why if this old house could talk
All it would say is welcome home",2004

A Good Year For The Roses,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/agoodyearfortheroses.html,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them 
While you packed

And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes 
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses 

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you  
Haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say
We haven't said
While a million thoughts
Go runnin' through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin'
Goes unheard

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes 
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses",1971

Beautiful Goodbye,Amanda Marshall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amandamarshall/beautifulgoodbye.html,"I'm fed up with my destiny
And this place of no return
I think I'll take another day
And slowly watch it burn
And it doesn't really matter
How the time goes by
'Cause I still remember you and I

We staggered through these empty streets
Laughing arm in arm
The night had made a mess of me
Your confessions kept me warm
I don't really miss you, I just need to know
Do you ever think of you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

In these days of no regrets
I keep mine to myself
And all the things we never said
I can save for someone else
And nothing lasts forever
But we always try
And I just can't help but wonder why
We let it pass us by, yeah

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

Baby, what can I do
Oh, to get through to you
And sometimes I cry, yeah
It's a fool's lullaby
Sometimes I cry
It's just a fool's lullaby
I'm dying inside",1995
Blind Love,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/blindlove.html,"Now you're gone

And I can't get on the train

It must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
With your blind love

Now the streets are turning blue
And the dogs are barking
And the night has come
And there are tears that are falling
From your blue eyes now
Well I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name
The only way to find you
Is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love

It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love

With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love

The Night,Morphine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morphine/thenight.html,"You're the night, Lilah
A little girl lost in the woods

I can't make it on my own

And I don't want your good luck charms
I hope you're waiting for me

You're the sounds I've never heard before
Off the map where the wild things grow
Another world outside my door
Here I stand I'm all alone
Driving down the pitch black road
Lilah you're my only home
And I can't make it on my own

Sunshower,Chris Cornell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chriscornell/sunshower.html,"Dark as roses, fine as sand
Feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish
Or recollections of better days gone by

But its all right
When you're caught in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Its all right
Though your gardens grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights

But its all right
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Oh its all right
Though your gardens gray
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sunshower

I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower
And its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today
Its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today.........",1999

Why Should I Care,Diana Krall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianakrall/whyshouldicare.html,"Was there something more I could have done? 
Or was I not meant to be the one? 
Where's the life I thought we would share? 
And should I care? 

And will someone else get more of you? 
Will she go to sleep more sure of you? 
Will she wake up knowing you're still there? 
And why should I care? 

There's always one to turn and walk away 
And one who just wants to stay 
But who said that love is always fair? 
And why should I care? 

Should I leave you alone here in the dark? 
Holding my broken heart 
While a promise still hangs in the air 
Why should I care?",1999
Tuesday Morning,Melissa Etheridge,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melissaetheridge/tuesdaymorning.html,"10:03 on a Tuesday morning 
in the fall of an American dream 
a man is doing what he knows is right 
on flight 93 

Loved his mom and he loved his dad 
loved his home and he loved his man 
but on that bloody Tuesday morning 
he died and American 

[chorus]
Now you cannot change this 
You can't erase this 
You can't pretend this is not the truth 

Even though he could not marry 
Or teach your children in our schools 
Because who he wants to love 
Is breaking your God's rules 

He stood up on a Tuesday Morning 
In the terror he was brave 
And he made his choice and without a doubt 
A hundred lives he must have saved

And the things you might take for granted 
Your inalienable rights 
Some might choose to deny him 
Even though he gave his life 

Can you live with yourself in the land of the free 
And make him less of a hero than the other three 
Well it might begin to change ya 
In a field in Pennsylvania

Stand up America 
Hear the bell now as it tolls 
Wake up America 
It's Tuesday Morning 
Let's roll

You're Stronger Than Me,Patsy Cline,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/patsycline/yourestrongerthanme.html,"If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still, fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be.
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me...",ompi
Plenty,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/plenty.html,"I looked into your eyes
they told me plenty
I already knew
you never felt a thing
so soon forgotten all that you do
in more than words I
tried to tell you
the more I tried I failed
I would not let myself believe
that you might stray
and I would stand by you
no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you
until my dying day
until my dying day
I used to think my life
was often empty
a lonely space to fill
you hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
you made my world stand still
and in that stillness
there was a freedom
I never felt before
I would not let myself believe
that you might stray
and I would stand by you
no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you
until my dying day
until my dying day",1993
The Difficult Kind,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/thedifficultkind.html,"I think I was wrong
I think you were right
That all my angry words
Will keep me up at night
And through the old screen door
I still hear you say
Oh, Honey won't you stop
Treating me that way

[Chorus]
If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed

Tell it to me slow
Tell me with your eyes
If anyone should know
How to let it slide
I swear I can see you
Coming up the drive
And there ain't nothing like regret
To remind you you're alive

[Chorus]

I crossed the canyon a thousand times
But never noticed what was mine
What you'll remember of me tonight
Well, it almost makes me cry
Yeah, it almost makes me cry

Oh ballbreaking moon and ridiculing stars
The older I get, the closer you are
Don't you have somewhere that you need to be
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see the change in me
If you could only see
What love has made of me
But I'll forever be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see
No you won't see
The good in me
But babe I've changed
Cause babe I've changed",1998
She's A Jar,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/shesajar.html,"She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A hand full of wheel
And a day off
And a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk, I sing
Wont you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil

Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her",1998
Late Goodbye,Poets of the Fall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/poetsofthefall/lategoodbye.html,"In our headlights, staring, bleak, beer cans, deer's eyes
On the asphalt underneath, our crushed plans and my lies
Lonely street signs, powerlines, they keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath hot upon my cheek, and we crossed, that line
You made me strong when I was feeling weak, and we crossed, that one time
Screaming stop signs, staring wild eyes, keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair, and then we're playing hide and seek
I can't breathe easy here, less our trail's gone cold behind us
Till' in the john mirror you stare at yourself grown old and weak

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye...",2005
What You're Made Of,Lucie Silvas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luciesilvas/whatyouremadeof.html,"Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
'Cause I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're not in love this time...but it's alright.

I hear you talking, but your words don't mean a thing
I doubt you ever put your heart into anything
It's not much to ask for, to get back what I put in
But I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

What do you really want him to become?
No matter what I sacrifice it's still never enough.

Just like I predicted
I will sink before I swim
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in

Isn't going down so well
And this road that I have followed
Is leading me to Hell

But I think you're a liar
Is this one of your talents
That stokes the very fire that burns you
Each time you try to live

And something has to give
Oh something has to give

And when I build you a steeple
You say it's incomplete
'Cause you need the whole cathedral
To satisfy the need

That never seems to land
Flying blind through anything
Straight into the hand that chokes you

Anywhere I Lay My Head,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/anywhereilaymyhead.html,"My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve at me
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere I'm gonna
Lay my head, boys
I'm will call my home

Well I see that
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold

Because I learned to be alone
And anywhere
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home",1985

Jacob's Dream,Alison Krauss,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alisonkrauss/jacobsdream.html,"In the spring of 1856 with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
200 men had gathered there to comb the mountain side
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and erie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

a thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry

Saint James Infirmary,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/saintjamesinfirmary.html,"I went down to Saint James Infirmary
For to see, for to see my baby there
Man, she was laid out on a long white table
She was so cold, and so cool, and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she might be
Lord, you can search this whole wide world over
But she ain't never going to find another lover man like me

When I die, I want you to dress me in straight lace shoes
I want a box back coat and a stetson hat
I want a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So everybody goin' to know that I died standing pat",2003
Nothing to Lose,Billy Talent,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billytalent/nothingtolose.html,"Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know
Put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone
So I became lifeless
Just like my telephone

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I'd have to check my mirror
To see if I'm still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches
Alone in the bathroom

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

Teachers said ""it's just a phase""
When I grow up my children
Will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
Who'd know it put me underground at seventeen

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain
There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
My notebook will explain

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
And I just died today",2003
The Long Goodbye,Ronan Keating,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ronankeating/thelonggoodbye.html,"I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free (so they say)
But it sure is hard to do
Yeah, it sure is hard to do
And I know they say if they don't come back again
Then it's meant to be (so they say)
But those words ain't pulling me through
Cos I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill
(climbin' up a hill) 

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
and I know without a doubt
We turned it inside out
And if we walked away
would make more sense (only self defense)
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep riding on a carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere?
(on a wing and prayer)

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

How long must we keep riding on a carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere?
on a wing and prayer

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it

I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack,

She'll recite her excuses

Know what goes on behind my back every night, 
afraid I'll never leave, 
afraid I'll never know what's good for me.

And now you swear that you're being honest,

Mad About You,Sting,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/madaboutyou.html,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient sighs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you",1991

Do What I Gotta Do,Ralph Tresvant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ralphtresvant/dowhatigottado.html,"(So, so hard, girl)

I'm 'bout to do this
Oh, I guess it's one of those things
A man just has to do
But I promise
It'll work out for the better, baby
Trust me

(I gotta)

I've been feeling lately
Like being single or just alone
To get into myself

Love ain't easy
Making me crazy
Games that we play
Sometimes the rules have to change

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty
So what am I gonna do?

I guess I'll do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

(Be apart, baby)
I gotta

Any good relationships starts
Inside of a happy man
I think she will understand

If I tell her straight up
Then she can only respect me
Even if we don't agree

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty, baby
So what am I gonna do?

Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

I gotta do what I gotta do

Do, do, do, do, do

And I don't wanna see you cry, baby
But what am I gonna do?

Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry

Penny to My Name,Eva Cassidy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evacassidy/pennytomyname.html,"Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
And I was only nineteen when I had my third baby 
And sometimes I think maybe I should've left here long ago 

Travellers are stopping by, check their oil and their p.s.i. 
Gas up and away to fly, moving down the line 
But this beat-up truck & worn out shoes always give me the blues 
Billy sucking down the booze nearly every night 

[Chorus]
I never seen the city lights 
How they must shine so bright 
Not like this country night 
The sky's black as coal 
And this gas-station mountain home 
Not a thing to call my own 
How I wish I was alone 
With a penny to my name 

Strangers say this mountain here is beautiful beyond compare 
But it's just a dumb old mountain; I see it every day 
If I could see sunset skies over fields of green or ocean-tides, 
City skyline in the night, I'll be dancing till the dawn 

[Chorus]

Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
Maybe Bill & I someday will find a chance to get away 
Until then it's here I'll stay wishing on a star

You're bringin' out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'
Homie I dont know she's hot and cold
I won't stop I won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than 
Me

'Cause in the night 
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul 
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far far far he lost his soul 
To a woman so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless
Oh

'Cause in the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul 
To a woman so heartless",2009
Too Late,M83,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/m83/toolate.html,"I look into your eyes
Diving into the ocean
I look into your eyes

Like a wall of stars
We are ripe to fall

And if you are a ghost
I'll call your name again
And if you are a ghost
I'll call your name...

You, always.",2008
Power Trip Ballad,Maria Mena,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariamena/powertripballad.html,"The way in which I fear is solely a reflection of you,
The devastating child of the power trip you forced me through.
But how could he leave you,
Could he fuck that whore he left you for?
Get revenge;

And by all means ask your nine year old daughter to choose between you,
Don't stay friends.
Now let her in on how he's the devil,
He's just been falsely portrayed.
But force her to go stay at his house once a week
'Cause you wanna get laid,
Ha-ha-ha-ha

Ask me why he scares me,
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.

Your girl's in the bathroom washing her hands again,
Why doesn't she eat?
Her father left us
What about me?
I can't rest,
I can't sleep.

Mommy loves you
I'm just tired of you and your brother's shit.
And you know I didn't mean to hit you,
But you were asking for it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha

Ask me why she scares me.
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.
You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.
You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.
You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.
You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.",2008
Torch,Soft Cell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/softcell/torch.html,"I'm lost again and I'm on the run
Looking for love in a sad song
With your avenger eyes and your catlike ways I can hold you
You are a fool for me to be cruel
I'm leaning on this bar listening to you sing
And your sad song rings in my ears and I start to cry

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I hear the saxophone and it tears my soul
And we're feeling old, feeling so cold
She is the torch and she is the theme
She could be a dream but - oh boy - is she real
Try to avoid her eyes, to avoid her words
They will hit you with all that you feel

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

See her eyes they are bright tonight.
See the stars coming out tonight.
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight. 

See my eyes they are bright tonight.
See my hands reaching out tonight.
Hear my words they are dynamite
See how they light your way tonight

See her eyes they are bright tonight
See her eyes they are bright tonight
See how they light your way tonight",1981
One More Sad Song,The All-American Rejects,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/allamericanrejects/onemoresadsong.html,"One boy, one girl, two hearts, their world
Time goes by, secrets rise
One more, sad song, tears shed, she's gone
She'd take it back, if she only could

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see
The door is closed and you wish you could be

Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do, I cannot breathe
My heart is torn, for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me

Best friend, worst thing, she's been, cheating
Friend deceives, she leaves
Last date. She cries, whispers, goodbye
She walks once more, out that door

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see
The door is closed and you wish you could be

Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do, I cannot breathe
My heart is torn, for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me

Please stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
Please stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
What can I do?

Alone with you, alone with me, what can I do?

Alone with you, alone with me, what can I do?

I Don't Know You Anymore,Savage Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savagegarden/idontknowyouanymore.html,"I would like to visit you for a while
Get away and out of this city
Maybe I shouldn't have called but someone had to be the first to break
We can go sit on your back porch
Relax
Talk about anything
It don't matter
I'll be courageous if you can pretend that you've forgiven me

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

Springtime in the city
Always such relief from the winter freeze
The snow was more lonely than cold
If you know what I mean
Everyone's got an agenda, don't stop
Keep that chin up, you'll be all right
Can you believe what a year it's been
Are you still the same?
Has your opinion changed?
'Cause I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from these sentences
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I know I let you down
Again and again
I know I never really treated you right
I've paid the price
I'm still paying for it every day

So maybe I shouldn't have called
Was it too soon to tell?
Oh what the hell
It doesn't really matter
How do you redefine something that never really had a name?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,Patty Loveless,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pattyloveless/howcanihelpyousaygoodbye.html,"Through the back window of a '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slippin' further away
I kept on waving 'till I couldn't see her
And through my tears, I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed, he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling, we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up Mama, she said, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

Sitting with Mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes, and then squeezed my hand
She said, I have to go now, my time here is over
And with her final word, she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

You Broke My Heart,William Fitzsimmons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/williamfitzsimmons/youbrokemyheart.html,"Fourteen years is all you made it
Till forgiveness was frustrated
I was sorry you missed Christmas
Do you think that you'll still miss us

I was angry when you left us
And it showed up on my mattress
And I told myself it's better
If we only talk in letters

You broke my heart
You broke my heart

Did you think about my mother
When you shared the same bed cover
Did you wonder if it changed her
When your sons became your stranger

When will you admit your lonely
Since we split apart the family
All the pictures are updated
All of us are separated

You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
I don't feel it anymore
You broke my heart
I don't feel it anymore

You broke my ...",2006
Startin' With Me,Jake Owen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jakeowen/startinwithme.html,"I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline

I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck when she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell

And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed when the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma died

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see

Ohh, I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

Ohh, I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

Dance With My Father,Luther Vandross,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luthervandross/dancewithmyfather.html,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved?
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",2003
The Fallen One,HammerFall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hammerfall/thefallenone.html,"I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Silently, whispering my name

So many things that I wanted to say
Forever left untold
I still remember the tears that you shed
Over someone else

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

There is a light down at memory lane
Slowly fading away
Still holding on to the dreams torn apart
I will follow my heart

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

Still on my own, chasing the sun
Of a time long ago
The shade in my heart, tearing apart
Everything that I long for

I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Whispering my name

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one",1998
A Little Rain,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/alittlerain.html,"The Ice Man's mule is parked
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the buthcer's son
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one

They're dancing on the roof
And the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it wurth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one

The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride

She was 15 years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was, ""I love you mom.""

And a little rain
Never hurt no one
And a little rain
Never hurt no one",1992
Song to Sing When I'm Lonely,John Frusciante,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnfrusciante/songtosingwhenimlonely.html,"A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again
No one to face when I'm falling
Holding tight to dreams that never end
I'll be you
I do
I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyones reason
Everything dying and leaving
Out with these faults and you make me a baby
Faking an movement by no ones seeing it
No one always find peace flung
No one chooses to beat my pride down
Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up
Sunlight to fate accumalates
Loving pain to be clung to
By lumimous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong
And true to us
Out of place in my own time
Drowning thinkin that I'm dry
Holding on to facts that'll never be proven
Faking an action cus no one's looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feeling nothing when my life's flashing before my eyes
You should've threw me down
Is the content so much",2003
You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/youllneverleaveharlanalive.html,"In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive

Oh, my granddad's dad walked down 
Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth
Of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
'Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I'll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive

Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west 
Of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling 
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave

Ruby and Carlos,James McMurtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmcmurtry/rubyandcarlos.html,"Ruby said you're gettin' us in a world of hurt
â¨And down below the Mason Dumb Ass line the food gets worse
â¨I can't go back to Tennesseeâ¨That NASCAR country's not for meâ¨
Go on if you think you must

â¨â¨Carlos packed his drums up in the dark of night
â¨Ruby standing just outside the front porch light
â¨Chain-smoking Camel straights
The sky off to the East got grey
â¨And he rolled off in a cloud of dustâ¨â¨

The grey colt nickered at the gateâ¨
She said ""you're right it's gettin' lateâ¨
You and me got work to doâ¨
We can't be burning daylight too""â¨
She took down the long lead ropeâ¨
And stayed off that slippery slope

â¨â¨The aspen trees were turning gold up topâ¨
The talk was buzzing round the beauty shopâ¨
""Wasn't he barely half her age?""
â¨""Well that's just how they do nowadays
â¨We should all a'been so lucky""â¨â¨

By spring she'd had the run of all the freeborn men
â¨Ruby turned fifty in a sheep camp tent
â¨Her body still could rock all nightâ¨
But her heart was closed and locked up tight
â¨Potato fields all muddy and brownâ¨
The gossip long since quieted downâ¨â¨

After one more Coggins test
â¨Pouring coffee for the county vet

â¨â¨Pictures on the ice box doorâ¨
Of Carlos in the first Gulf Warâ¨
Black eyed, brown and youthful faceâ¨
Smiling back from a Saudi baseâ¨â¨

Then Carlos on the big bay mareâ¨
Heavier now and longer haired
â¨Looking past the saddle shed
â¨From way on back inside his headâ¨â¨

The old vet said one day Rube
â¨That colt will break an egg in you
Now and then one comes along
â¨You just can't ride then he went on homeâ¨â¨

The storm door didn't catch
â¨It blew back hardâ¨As she struck a match
â¨But she cupped it just in time
â¨Then she sent that ash tray flyingâ¨â¨(

[Chorus:]
Holding back the floodâ¨
Just don't do no goodâ¨
You can't unclench your teeth
To howl the way you should
â¨So you curl your lips aroundâ¨
The taste of tears and a hollow sound
That no one owns but you
â¨No one owns but youâ¨â¨

Carlos took the road gig and he saw it through
â¨He rode the tour bus while the singer flew
â¨Managed out of Music Rowâ¨
Carlos never saw the studioâ¨
Session guys had that all sewn upâ¨â¨

He looks out the window as it starts to sleet
â¨Layinâ on a friend's couch on Nevada Street
â¨Lately he's been staying high
Sick all winter and they don't know why
â¨They don't know why or they just won't sayâ¨
They don't talk much down at the VAâ¨â¨

Ruby's in his thoughts sometimes
â¨What thoughts can get out past the wine
â¨He feels her fingers on his brow
â¨And right then he misses how
â¨She looked in that grey morning light
â¨She never shaved like they all do now
He sees it all behind his eyes
â¨His hands go searching but they come up dryâ¨â¨

Halfway in that waking dreamâ¨
Carlos lets the land line ringâ¨â¨

He'd never have guessed it was Ruby calling
â¨A pin in her hip from the grey colt falling
â¨Figure eights in a lazy lope
â¨Stumbled on that slippery slope

â¨â¨[Chorus]",2008
Do You Dream at All,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/doyoudreamatall.html,"When you crawl into bed
You pull the covers a bit too tight
Get drunk and lay your head on my pillow
Mute and white
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
It's always those black black circles around your eyes
Darker still
Such dead slumber will get you nowhere in the end
So do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you wish someone was there to rock you to sleep?
And hold you near?
Well, that won't be me.
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?

No Joy in Mudville,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/nojoyinmudville.html,"Last night I dreamt that I was you. I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude.
Such a pose I could simply not hold through days in a northern town that I had once called a home.
Your studies of fringe New York streets... I was reading the pavement in every work you would speak.
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
Buying drinks for the poets upstate, this southern corrupting towed you down the interstate,
And they all said that you were the king of gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would speak.
This town simply cannot compete so I'm packing my Bullets and Silverstones
And heading east to a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
If I could have (had) my way this year would bridge '66 (again?)
Trust fund hipsters were casing the room chock full of amphetamines.
The overturned kick drum book set the pace with incomparable cool.
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you...",2000
The Right Man,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/therightman.html,"So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give his bride away

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man

Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child

My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own

Here I go

Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew a right man

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance

Ohh

Well I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance

And one day my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man",2006
Crying in the Chapel,Elvis Presley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elvispresley/cryinginthechapel.html,"You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees

Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way",1967
Songs About Rain,Gary Allan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garyallan/songsaboutrain.html,"Well this town has closed down way too early, 
And there's nothing to do,
So I'm driving around in circles, 
And I'm thinking about you,
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way,
And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain
Now there's all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car, 
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like,

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain,
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not,
Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I'll never know what could have been,
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in,
If their gonna keep on playing me songs like, 

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain,
All these songs about rain,
Songs about rain.......",2003
Sealed With A Kiss,Jason Donovan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasondonovan/sealedwithakiss.html,"Though we've got to say
Goodbye for the summer
Darling, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there

I don't wanna say
Goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh, let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with kiss",1989
Saving All My Love for You,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/savingallmyloveforyou.html,"A few stolen moments is all that we share 
You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone 
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own 
But each time I try I just break down and cry 
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
So I'm saving all my love for you 

You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy 

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door 

'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you 

No other woman is gonna love you more 
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you 
For you, for you",1985

i see all the reasons why 
my life's worth a thousand skies

and the purest one i'll own 
know you'll never be alone

my baby you 
are the reason i could fly 
and 'cause of you 
i don't have to wonder why 
baby you 
there's no more just getting by 
you're the reason i feel so alive 
though these words i say are true 
they still fail to capture you 
as mere words can only do 
how do i explain that smile 
and how it turns my world around 
keeping my feet on the ground

i will soothe you if you fall 
i'll be right there if you call 
you're my greatest love of all

I Stopped to Fill My Car Up,Stereophonics,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stereophonics/istoppedtofillmycarup.html,"I stopped to fill my car up
The car felt good that day
I didn't know where I was going
But it felt good for a change
A five and a pocket full of silver
I paid the lady no change
And then it started to piss down
I started driving again

And then I looked up
And looked in the mirror behind me

A man round forty in the back seat
Must have stepped in when I was empty
So why's he sat there just waiting
Likely to smash my face in

He had a bag full of money
He said just drive me away
I didn't know where I was going
Yet it felt good to be strange

And still I look up
And look in the mirror behind me

Curiosity is over
He stepped down from the car
He pulled a gun out from his jacket
Said I was going to die

It gives me so much satisfaction
To watch you beg and cry
Well I just made up this story
To get your attention makes me smile

I never looked up or looked
In the mirror behind me",1999
Do I Have to Say the Words,Bryan Adams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bryanadams/doihavetosaythewords.html,"Rescue me from the mire

Want you here by my side
Come to me, darling, rescue me

When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free, darling, rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me, please, darling, rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see? Darling, rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Yeah!

Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?

Song for You,Alexi Murdoch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aleximurdoch/songforyou.html,"So today I wrote a song for you 
Cause a day can get so long 
And I know it's hard to make it through 
When you say there's something wrong 

So I'm trying to put it right 
Cause I want to love you with my heart 
All this trying has made me tired 
And I don't know even where to start 

Maybe that's a start 

For you know it's a simple game 
That you play filling up your head with rain 
And you know you've been hiding from your pain 
In the way, in the way you say your name 

And I see you 
Hiding your face in your hands 
Flying so you won't land 
You think no one understands 
No one understands 

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head 
And your throat is aching but you swear 
No one hurts you, nothing could be sad 
Anyway you're not here enough to care 

And you're so tired you don't sleep at night 
As your heart is trying to mend 
You keep it quiet but you think you might 
Disappear before the end 

And it's strange how you cannot find 
Any strength to even try 
To find a voice to speak your mind 
When you do, all you wanna do is cry 

Well maybe you should cry 

And I see you hiding your face in your hands 
Talking 'bout far-away lands 
You think no one understands 
Listen to my hands 

And all of this life 
Moves around you 
For all that you claim 
You're standing still 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
I will move with you",2006
The Curse,Josh Ritter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joshritter/thecurse.html,"He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight
With the girl in the doorway
What beautiful lines and how full of life
After thousands of years what a face to wake up to
He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm
She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping
And under miles of stone, the dried fig of his heart
Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating

She carries him home in a beautiful boat
He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage
He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed
And one day his lips answer her in her own language
The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh
The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches
She asks, âAre you cursed?â He says, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes

In New York he is laid in a glass covered case
He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him
But each night she comes round and the two wander down
The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum
Often he stops to rest but then less and less
Then it's her that looks tired staying up asking questions
He learns how to read from the papers that she
Is writing about him and he makes corrections

It's his face on her book more and more come to look
Families from Iowa, upper west siders
Then one day it's too much he decides to get up
And as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her
She's using a cane and her face looks too pale
But she's happy to see him as they walk he supports her
She asks, âAre you cursed?â but his answer's obscured
In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters

Such reanimation the two tour the nation
He gets out of limos he meets other women
He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum
But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him
She stops going out she just lies there in bed
In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking
Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold
And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating

Long ago on the ship she asked, âWhy pyramids?â
He said, âThink of them as an immense invitationâ
She asked, âAre you cursed?â He said, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question",2010
Late in the Day,Supergrass,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/supergrass/lateintheday.html,"It's late in the day,

Its late in the day,

Hear what I say,
So long,
So long for me,

All the time I thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,

Is people pass along the way,

I lay on my bed,
Searching my mind,
Writing my love,
So long,
So long for me,

I sleep on the road,
Dream of a sound,
Coming my way,
So long,
So long for me,

And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
I close my eyes and turn away,

And all the time I've been with you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
And thoughts of you and me again",1997

You fucked up my life

Tell me, did your shadow trip an' fall,
Over you, babe, movin' that slowly?
Did you think you could waste my time,
Come a-messin' round with my mind?
Did you think you could? You don't know me.
Where'd you get that alibi?
Did it fall out of a midnight sky,
Or did you find it on the side of the road?
Tell me: Did you have to make a deal,
Or wrestle for control, of the wheel, from your conscience?

Where do you go,
On your way home?

You know, someday, I'd like to fly,
Like a bat outta Nashville. Why don't you help me?
An' tell me the truth.
'Cause the truth is gonna set you free.
If you keep on lyin' to me, I might stay right here,
Just to spite you.

Or did you find it lyin' on the side of the road?
Was it ever a long, long drive?
Did you ever stop once to cry, or was I worth it?
I think I know.
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go,
On your way home?
On your way home?",2003
Fool,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/fool.html,"Apartment in New York, London and Paris
Where will we rest, we're all living on top of it
It's all that we have the USA our daily bread
And no one is willing to share it

Why can't we see our fortunancy
Living as legends have lived
Bane and dismannered
We coax all the time
Knowing that nothing is left when we die

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent

Wanting to live and laugh all the time
Sitting alone with you tea and your crime
Children with kids and people with parents
Any which way there's no past and no present
When the day comes and all of them bums
Will reveal enchanting persons

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent

When it's a rut and baby's no luck
Half of it's misunderstanding love
The war we have won we're winning again
Within ourselves and within our friends

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent",2003
I Won't See You Tonight Part 1,Avenged Sevenfold,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avengedsevenfold/iwontseeyoutonightpart1.html,"Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, 
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. 
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight",2003
Simple Together,Alanis Morissette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/simpletogether.html,"You've been my golden best friend
Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition
This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things
I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken
You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you I knew god's face was handsome
With you I saw final expansion
This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything
I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe
I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together
But I was sadly mistaken

I wonder why
You left me here,

I know you're never coming back,
I hope that you can hear me,
I'm waiting to hear from you..

You're gone away,

I'll meet you there,
And even if I need you here,

I wish I could have told you,
The things I kept inside,
But now I guess its just too late.
So many things remind me of you,
I hope that you can hear me,
I miss you,
This is goodbye,
One last time..

Forever as One,Vengaboys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vengaboys/foreverasone.html,"I wish I could turn back time 
I wish I'd never have to see that look in your eyes 
You really broke this heart of mine 
Now it's time to realise it's forever goodbye 

So here I am 
All alone 
Don't understand where did we go wrong 
I can't stop crying 
Can't take the pain 
Knowing you won't ever be back again 

And it cuts like a knife 
I'm going insane 
Wishing you would show me love 
Once again 
I'm losing my mind 
But I have to carry on 
We were meant to be together 
Forever as one 

So this is where the story ends 
Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes 
You told me we could still be friends 
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies 

So here 
I amAll alone 
Don't understand where did we go wrong 
I can't stop crying 
Can't take the pain 
Knowing you won't ever be back again 

And it cuts like a knife 
I'm going insane 
Wishing you would show me love 
Once again 
I'm losing my mind 
But I have to carry on 
We were ment to be together

Yesterday was mine
You'll be turning five
I know what it's like, growing up without your father in your life
So I pretend, I'm doing all I can
And I hope someday you'll find it in your heart

To understand
Why I'm not around
And forgive me for not being in your life

I remember waiting
For you to come
Remember waiting
For you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
I remember waiting
For you to come
Remember waiting
For you to call
Waiting there to find nothing at all

maybe someday
you really get to know me
not just the letters read to you
I pray I get the chance
To make it up to you
We got a lot of catching up to do

So I pretend, I'm doing all I can
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart

Redemption,Frank Turner,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/frankturner/redemption.html,"I was walking home to my house through the snow from the station
When the Springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question
Oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption?
Or are we all merely biding our time down to lonely conclusions?
Darling let me take your hand as I talk you through this
How loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis
Lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on tape hiss
With my feelings laid clear on the ceiling
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can do this

Well I tried so hard to not turn into my father
But if I only ever skip all his choices will I ever choose better?
Oh the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener
So I left you alone in a restaurant in London in winter
You deserved better

Adam Trask is on my back and in my ears
And the sound comes clear and brings the awful truth
That I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary
Today should have been our anniversary
And I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can't escape
I only ever have myself to blame

These failures shift and shake me in the night
Like a fever I can't break try as I might
Wake me darling I need you take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine, and mine alone

So if each of us is made up of a tally of mistakes and successes
Then my hour in that restaurant makes my score less than impressive
But each can be redeemed with the courage with which he confesses
So darling I miss you, your music and your musk and your kisses
I don't think I can do this",2011
Shape of My Heart,Backstreet Boys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/backstreetboys/shapeofmyheart.html,"Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow

Hold me now, don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
So, help me, I can't win this war, oh no

Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
Or keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done

A Distance There Is,Theatre of Tragedy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/theatreoftragedy/adistancethereis.html,"Come in out of the rain thou sayest
But thou ne'er step'st aside
And I'm trapp'd, I'm trapp'd
A distance there is

None, save me and the bodkin
Pitter-patter on the roof
Behold! - 'tis not the rain
Thence me it has to be
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocence
Yet thou let'st thy lass into peril
Thou let'st me be parched

My heart is of frailty
My pale skin is hued damask

When thou thy tears hast hidden
""Come back!"", thou sayest
There I soon am to be
But how am I to run when my bones, my heart
Thou hast me bereaft
But run thou sayest
I run...

And there and then I behold that a time will come
When I again dead will be
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay
I leave...

Oh, I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk

In my mind in which is this event
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?

After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world
All the beautiful moments shared, deliberately push'd aside

After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world

To me, you're strange and you're beautiful
You'd be so perfect with me

You turn every head but you don't see me

When I put a spell on you
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me

Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first
Sometimes the first thing you want never comes
But I know that waiting is all you can do
Sometimes

I'll put a spell on you
You'll fall asleep
When I put a spell on you
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realise that you love me

I'll put a spell on you

Forest of Love,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/forestoflove.html,"I'm a girl, five years old 
God, don't take my boy
Give him back, my brother 
Murderer or beauty

Don't send him to the slaughter house 
Don't send him into watersnakes 
He needs from the forest
The forest of love

I will live, he can live 
Maybe we can be there
Forest is good, home inside 
Safest, warmest bed

Birds drinking from the stream
Hardened smell of grow
Trees all alive and will cry 
Washed by songs entirely

Don't send him to the ocean cold
Don't send him to the water afraid
He needs from the forest
The forest of love
The forest, the forest of love

I'm in the forest of love 
I'm in there, the forest of love
I'm in there, the forest of love
I'm in there, the forest of love

Ooh the here and now 
Ooh, my brother
Ooh, my brother
Ooh, my brother
Ooh, my brother, my brother

Don't send him to the ocean cold
Don't send him to the water afraid
He needs from the forest

Only Hope,Mandy Moore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mandymoore/onlyhope.html,"[Written by Switchfoot]

There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But you sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands
And pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing
And laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give you my destiny
I'm giving you all of me
I want your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope",

I was so blind
All the lights are leading to where you're going
I'm not far behind

From some lost and distant shore
I hear you crying softly for the way it was before

Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone?
Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?
Why did you go? I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait? Will you wait?
Will I see you again?

You took it with you when you left
These scars are just a trace
Now it wanders lost and wounded
This heart that I misplaced

Are you lost?
Will I find you again?

Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss -- kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on -- but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try",1989

If it gets me through this night

But I've got to move on, tell me what else can I do

I know, one day, I'll love again",1999
Little Rock,Collin Raye,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/collinraye/littlerock.html,"Well, I know I disappeared a time or two,
and along the way I lost me and you.
I needed a new town for my new start
selling VCR's in Arkansas at a Wal-Mart.

I haven't had a drink in nineteen days.
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze.
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ.
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

I don't know why I held it all inside,
you must've thought I never even tried.
You know your daddy told me when I left
that Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

Lying here upon this motel bed,
my thoughts of you explode inside my head.
Like a castle built upon the sand,
I let love crumble in my hand.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

I want another chance just to adore you
(Gonna take my time, take my time, to give you the love that you want)
Won't you take the time (Love you)
Take the time to see (Leave me)
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free (Adore you)

Cuz I love you
I love you

Waitin for you
For you, baby
I love you

[Nokio:]
We need each other
I taught you how to love
You taught me how to love
And from that we created love (I love you)
You stayed with me when I was doin' wrong
So why'd you leave me when I started doin right
The beauty's gone
I love you
I love you",2002
History,Funeral for a Friend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/funeralforafriend/history.html,"Dear friends of this academy
Oh, Romeo is bleeding to death..
To see a friend bleed to death
What for, some kind of metaphor
That I can't see..
So I'll drink until I see it.

This sky will make me sick,
So I'll give up on you,
I'll give up on this.
This sky will make me sick,
So I'll give up on this,
I'll give up on you.

[Chorus]
Archers in your arches,
Raise your fingers for one last salute..
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine.

So you want to hold me up and bring me down?
Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down

I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you.
I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you.

Gotta Be Somebody's Blues,Jimmy Eat World,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmyeatworld/gottabesomebodysblues.html,"Let the water come
She's the only one I love
Let the fat man drop
She's the sweetest honey pot

Will they see the sky again?
Who will sing their blues for them?

Let the factories rust
She's the only thing I trust
Let the virus spread
She's the silk lining in my bed

Will they breathe our air again?
Who will sing their blues for them?

When you're feeling moot
You can have your conscience all you want
You can't say I do nothing yeah
I put it off

Where you gonna go if they come for you?
Will there be someone left to sing your blues?
Where you gonna run when they come for you?
Will there be someone to sing your blues?",2007
Don't Take the Girl,Tim McGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timmcgraw/donttakethegirl.html,"Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate holdin' a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go but someday you'll change your mind
And Johnny said ""Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm said ""If you do what I tell you to, there won't be any harm"" 
And Johnny said ""Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's going to be a little one and she says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fading fast and Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy
Was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old",1994
Sally's Pigeons,Cyndi Lauper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cyndilauper/sallyspigeons.html,"When I was eight I had a friend
With a pirate smile
Make believe and play pretend
We were innocent and wild
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate
Running down my alleyway
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly

We loved to watch them dive and soar 
Circle in the sky
Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly

I had a fool's confidence
That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities

My heart began to
Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
In tears she told me she was late
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...

On the dresser sits a frame 
With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly
She never saw those birds again
And me, I can't remember when 
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry
I close my eyes
And Sally's pigeons fly...",1993
I Look to You,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/ilooktoyou.html,"As I lay me down,
Heaven hear me now.
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all.

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun.
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

About to lose my breath,
There's no more fighting left,
Sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door.

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret.
And I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you.
I look to you.
And when all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

My levees are broken
My walls have come
Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling.
Defeat is calling.
I need you to set me free.

Take me far away from the battle.
I need you.
Shine on me.

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.",2009
She Thinks His Name Was John,Reba McEntire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rebamcentire/shethinkshisnamewasjohn.html,"She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then

But there is one she can't put her fingers on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams

And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John",1994
What I'd Say,Gary Allan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garyallan/whatidsay.html,"Talkin' to the mirror, whispering your name
It's just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say

There's time I've been so angry
I could put my fist right through the wall
And then there's times I've come so close
To givin' you a call
I love you and I hate you
All at the same time
Then I pray you'll come back to me
Before I lose my mind

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well

I Can Still Make Cheyenne,George Strait,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgestrait/icanstillmakecheyenne.html,"Her telephone rang  'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.

He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

[Chorus:]
She said, ""Don't bother comin' home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

[Chorus]

She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind",1996
Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/whosgonnafilltheirshoes.html,"You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your, radio heros
Like the outlaw that walks through Jesse's dream

No, there will never be another
Red-headed stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darling 
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes

[Chorus:]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes

God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And old Go Cat Go still echoes through the years

You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell when hew sings I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

[Chorus:]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes

Yes I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?..",1985
Too Cold At Home,Mark Chesnutt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markchesnutt/toocoldathome.html,"Well, it sure feels good to come in here
And just pull up a seat
A frosty mug of a cool one
Helps to beat the heat
These old dog days of summer
Lord, I'll be glad when they're gone
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Well, that baseball game on TV
Takes me back to when I was a kid
We proudly wore those uniforms
Just like the Dodgers did
Yea!, we won a few and and we lost a few
And for me it still goes on
Too hot to fish, and too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Well, I only planned on one or two
I might stay for three
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner
Keeps smilin' back at me
It's so easy not to care
'Bout what's right or what's wrong
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.",1990

I once played a big part in your world 
Think back and I know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world
Oh but whatever happened to me

I made up my own excuses for so long
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me

Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me",1967

You never had it so good babe
I never had it so bad

So you just go where you go
And do what you do
And be who you want to be
But when she burns you again
And your phone doesn't ring
Baby it's me

'Cause you're out of my life now
With a wave of her hand
You never had it so good babe
I never had it so bad
Now you can do what you want to
And never feel sad
You never had it so good babe
I never had it so bad",1989

I can hardly catch my breath
It happens when I think of you
And I think it always will
Every day that passes by
It's just one more way to die
Lord knows I'd be gone now on
If a broken heart could kill

Why didn't you just take a gun
And shoot me where I stood?
And put an end to this misery
For good

But you know, I'm still alive
And somehow I will survive
But Lord knows I'd be cold and still
If a broken heart could kill

Why didn't you just take a gun
And shoot me where I stood?
Lord knows if I had the nerve enough
I would

Oh, these days I barely get by

I walked home from work and it rained all the way
My wife left and didn't say why
She laid all our bills on the desk in the hall
Oh, these days I barely get by

Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose and I cried
Oh, my boss says come winter we'll all be laid off

Worst of all is when she told me goodbye

I've lost my way
My heart's stuck
in second place ooh
Without you

Well I never thought I'd be
lying here without you by my side

the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
but what about me 'cause

Without you I'm not okay
And without you
I've lost my way
My heart's stuck
in second place ooh

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you

Whoever's In New England,Reba McEntire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rebamcentire/whoeversinnewengland.html,"You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts

You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late and you'll always have a place to come back to

I take back everything I've said
You wore those words on your lips
As if they meant anything anyway

Sometimes I feel I could drop off the face of the earth
It seems I do more harm than good
And I don't know if it's worth me losing sleep over this

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

Fear was gone

And I fly... and I fly... and I fly
I can't get used to missing you
If this is how it's gotta be
I need an angel to watch over me
No one can hold the hands of time
But I can hold you in my mind
Over and over like a melody
For now
I'll stand still
For now
I'll be filled by the memory of your skin
I know you
You're not from here
You don't belong to lies and tears
The greatness of your soul
Makes me weep
You're not from here
Not from this here and now
Just a touch of yours

He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, ""It's you that makes me happy""
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

See, don't you do it baby
I said yeah
Don't you let go baby
See, you
Don't you do it

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't you let go baby
Don't you, don't you let go
I said yeah
Can I get how it feels baby
Don't you let go baby
Yeah
Oh
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand

Keep On Your Dress,The Pigeon Detectives,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pigeondetectives/keeponyourdress.html,"Was that supposed to mean you're making no sense?

They'll Never Know,Ross Copperman,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rosscopperman/theyllneverknow.html,"Hush, baby donât cry
Just get through this night
Overcome

Cuz all that you are
Is broken inside
But theyâll never know
Theyâll never know

Donât think that theyâll change
They push you away
Far from home

Cuz all that they are
Is broken inside
But theyâll never know
Theyâll never know

Donât you cry tonight
Rest your weary eyes
Cuz all that you are
Is broken inside
Itâs nothing you could change
Itâs nothing you could hide
Itâs nothing you could hide

Pink flowers and bows
Thatâs all you should know
And summer days

Cuz all that you are
Is beautiful child
But theyâll never know

So donât you cry tonight
Rest your precious eyes
Cuz all that you are
Is beautiful child

Itâs nothing you could hide
Itâs nothing you should hide

Oh oh oh

Cuz all that you are
Is beautiful child

Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donelljones/whereiwannabe.html,"[Verse 1]
I said I left my baby girl a message 
Sayin' I won't be coming home 
I'd rather be alone 
She doesn't fully understand me 
That I'd rather leave than to cheat 
If she gives me some time 
I can be the man she needs 
But there's a lot of lust inside of me 
And we've been together since our teenage years 
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time 
To be alone 

[Chorus 1]
But when you love someone 
You just don't treat them bad 
Oh, how I feel so sad 
Now that I wanna leave 
She's crying her heart to me 
How could you let this be? 
I just need time to see 
Where I wanna be 
Where I wanna be... 

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee... 
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no... 

[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine 
That you would play a major part 
In a decision that's so hard 
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go? 
I think about my life and what matters to me the most 
Girl, the love that we share is real 
But in time your heart will heal 
I'm not saying I'm gone 
But I have to find what life is like 
Without you 

[Chorus 1]

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee... 
I don't mean to hurt you, baby 

[Chorus 2 x3]
See when you love someone 
You just don't treat them bad 
Oh, how I feel so sad 
Now that I wanna leave 
She's crying her heart to me 
How could you let this be? 
And I just need time to see 
Where I wanna be 

Where I wanna be...",1999
Johnny Wanna Live,Sandra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandra/johnnywannalive.html,"I got something on my mind
Makes me sad and makes my cry - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Just an ordinary day
An animal will pass away - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Who's to say he got no rights
Even not a right to life
Don't know why it leaves you cold
Don't know how to make it show - oh no
Johnny wanna live
Johnny wanna live

Got to give his skin away
For coats they wear on summerdays - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Beauty aid and all the rest
Come directly from a test - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Through his eyes I look inside his heart
He can feel like me and you
Can't defend himself cause he can't talk
And this is why I talk you

Johnny isn't just a name
He stands for every creature's pain - oh no
Johnny wanna live
Johnny wanna live

Go and try to look inside his heart
You can find your own mistakes
Try to hide them thinking he can't talk
But he can read them in your face

I got something on my mind
It makes me sad
And it makes me cry - oh no
Let him live

Tell me why it leaves you cold
I swear
I'm gonna make it show - oh no
Johnny wanna live
Johnny wanna live",1990

Castle Down,Emilie Autumn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/emilieautumn/castledown.html,"You can see that I swim
Through the sea of painful
You have watched as I pulled 
Myself from the floor

And you were there when I 
Built my tower like pebbles in the rain
Trying to balance all that I had left
With what I didn't have any more

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

You seem so devoted
Your love is unconditional
You were self-promoted
I never asked you

You were my everything
My apparitional faith
Where are you when I am
Screaming to my god what am I coming to

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

If I had another place to go
Would you break me, is it that you know
I have no choice but to rebuild again
I'm tied so hard I can't remember when 
I last walked free upon these feet of mine

But I'll draw the line
There will come a time
When I am stronger
Your words won't hurt any longer

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left
'Til there is nothing, nothing left
'Til there is nothing left

Would you tear my castle down
Would you tear my castle down
Would you tear my castle down",2003
A Kiss Without Commitment,Daniel Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielbedingfield/akisswithoutcommitment.html,"[Bonus Track]

A kiss without commitment's
Like a flower without the rain
It only leads to pain
And it fills my heart with emptiness
Your touch without commitment's
Like a calm before the storm
The tears are starting to form in my eyes

When I kissed you I was curious
The child that I was
I never realised I would love you so
And in the magic of the moment
I was swept to the side
And I saw your heart
So small and tender

Physical is fine
But I cannot avoid the pain
I'm like an express train
As I surge towards the mountains
I am certain as I'm livin'
I cannot do this again
We're much too greater friends
To play games

When I kissed you it was
Everything I dreamed it would be
But I never dreamed it would mean so much to me
And our friendship is too valuable to carelessly lose
So today I choose
To really love you

Jessica your heart is
Like a newly budding rose
Expanding as she grows
Your petals have been bruised
But you have so much love to give
And it's so beautiful to see
You're beautiful to me, my friend

And when I kissed you
I believed it wouldn't get in the way
I want to stay your friend and have it fine
And I'm hoping that our God can make great things of our lives
His love survives
The greatest struggles

Jessica your gate is open, nothing in your way
A friend you'll always stay to me
Whatever else we're gonna be
A friend
You'll always stay to me",2004
Lost In You,Sugarcult,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugarcult/lostinyou.html,"Six days went by
Trying to forget her face
It was you and I
We were to young for these games

And all the pictures that I kept
And all the things I should have said
It was you and I
But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six weeks went by
Still pretending that I'm fine
It was you and I
Holding back what's on our minds

And all the things I should have said
And all the letters left unsent
It was you and I
But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six months went by
I almost forgot your face
Till they played that song tonight
The one we used to hate

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Lost in you(I'm lost in you)
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you(I'm lost in you)
And I can't find myself again

Everything I Build,The Stills,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stills/everythingibuild.html,"The tide is high
I've never been so low
You got room to grow

You can never look up
You can't ever look down
You get kicked around

But I built it with sand
And I built it with rock
I built it with all of the
Things that I'm not
And I watch from the hill
As it burns to the ground
I can still see the smoke 
From my train out of town

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

I close my eyes
Scared of what I saw
Are you mad at all?
Been an open book
Been a slamming door
Apple of the trojan war

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

Drink a little bit
Dance a little bit
Take a chance 
I lose it all
I have no remorse no regrets
When I'm hanging from 
This seventeenth floor

The tide is high
Never been so low
You got room to grow

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down",2008
Alone In Brewster Bay,Minnie Riperton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/minnieriperton/aloneinbrewsterbay.html,"Watch the fire die
See the snowflakes fly
Hear the geese out honking on the bay
Feel the fire's flame
Do they sigh your name
Think of you, my love, so far away

Once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you
I feel a lot like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'

Then I close my eyes
And I search the skies
For a sign of you thinking of me
Then I feel you here
You are oh so near
In my mind I find you next to me

Cause once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you
I feel a lot like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'

Watch the fire die
See the snowflakes fly
Hear the geese out honking on the bay
Thinking of you, my love, alone in Brewster Bay",1975
Mother and Father,Madonna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madonna/motherandfather.html,"There was a time I was happy in my life

There was a time I had a mother
It was nice

Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did

I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

[chorus]

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

I gotta give it up
[repeat twice]

[chorus]

Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up

I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up

I gotta give it up

Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,Patty Smyth,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pattysmyth/sometimeslovejustaintenough.html,"Now, I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love, it just ain't enough",1992

You step outside and hear bells ringing

Love Shoulda Brought You Home,Toni Braxton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/loveshouldabroughtyouhome.html,"Should I even listen
Should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines

See it doesn't matter
What you say this time
Cause our whole relationship
Is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me

How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of

Love Shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side

If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Gotta hand it to ya
Ya had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need

Love Shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side

If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe,
I just don't believe
That you'll allways be here

There's No Me Without You,Toni Braxton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/theresnomewithoutyou.html,"There's no me without you
There's no meaning to life without you

When I can't stop thinking about you?

There's no moon without you
There's no Saturday nights without you
There's no walk through the park
No beat in my heart
No, I love you, no, I can't live without you

You told me everything would be cool
Said I wouldn't always feel blue
How come I feel like a wreck?
How come the skies are all grey
How come my eyes are all red?
Why am I alone in my bed?

You told me everything would be fine
Why am I losing my mind?
How come I feel like a fool?
Why do I keep losing you?
Why do I love in despair
When you're not there?

Hurts The Most,Monica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monica/hurtsthemost.html,"[Verse 1:]
Boy its been a long time,
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothings changed
Since weâve been together
I must admit that Iâm still crazy âbout you
And I can see it in your eyes
That thereâs something you wanna say to me
Cuzz usually right now youâd be holding on to me
But instead youâre telling meâ¦.

That things have changed
Theyâre not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby what hurts the most
Is letting go
I just want you to know
That I love you so
And though things are different now
Youâve gone and settled down
I thought for sure youâd always wait for me
Iâll tell you what hurts the most
Is that I shouldâve took the chance
Boy when you come to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought, Iâd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love
And oh how Iâm missin you now

[Verse 2:]
I hate that thereâs someone new
Cominâ in and taking my place
Doin things that we used to do
And making love to youâ¦â¦.no
What am I supposed to do
Itâs killing me cuzz I want you
And you shouldâve know my love was true
And thereâs no one else in this world for me but you

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I know that Iâm the one to blame for losing you
Oh yeahâ¦
I really really wish that I could be happy for you
Thereâs just one thing I need you to do
Donât you touch her like you used to touch me
Donât you love her like you really needed me
Donât you love her like you used to love me

[Chorus]

What hurts the most
Is letting go
Just let you know
I love you so",2003
Misty Blue,Monica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monica/mistyblue.html,"Oh, Its, been such a long long time
Looks like I got you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Oh honey, just the mention of your name 
Turns a flicker to a flame
Listen to me good baby
I think of the things we used to do 
And my whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh, baby I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried 
Baby, when I said that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied, I've lied, I've lied

Oh, Its, been such a long long time
Looks like I got you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Ohhhhhhh, no I can't no I can't
I can't forget you 
My whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue

Baby [5x] I should forget you
My whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue

Baby, baby I should forget you
Misty blue",1998
