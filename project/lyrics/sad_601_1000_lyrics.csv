Crying,Roy Orbison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/royorbison/crying.html,"I was all right for awhile
I could smile for awhile
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, ""Hello""

Oh, you wished me well
You, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you

When you said, ""So long""
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying
Crying, crying

It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before

But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be crying over you
Crying over you

Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying
Crying, crying
Yeah, crying, crying
Over you",1962
Ruled by Secrecy,Muse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/ruledbysecrecy.html,"Repress and restrain
Steal the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control 

You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
Rebuild and suppress

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control 

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control",2003
Emotion,Destiny's Child,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/destinyschild/emotion.html,"It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to instead of me tonight?

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go go
I cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight

I'm there at your side,
A part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've got to find your shining star

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions taking me over, taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody left in this world... goodnight

And where are you now, now that I need you, you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you, you go
I cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions taking me over
I'm caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song
Don't you know I'm lost without you, baby?
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Nobody left in this world, nobody, to hold me tight
Nobody to hold me
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody to kiss me goodnight, goodnight",2001
In Loving Memory,Alter Bridge,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alterbridge/inlovingmemory.html,"Thanks for all you've done
I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone
You still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly

I've never knew what it was to be alone, no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
And I'll come home and I miss your face so
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

And I know, you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight 'cause it comforts me

I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of
The one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me

I've never knew what it was to be alone, no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and it's not the same, no
It feels empty and alone
I can't believe you're gone

And I know, you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight 'cause it comforts me

I'm glad He set you free from sorrow
I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you will be here with me still

And what you did you did with feeling
And you always found the meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will

And I know, you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight 'cause it comforts me",2004
Mother,John Lennon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/mother.html,"Mother, you had me but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Father, you left me but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

I couldn't walk and I tried to run
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Why Do I Feel So Sad,Alicia Keys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliciakeys/whydoifeelsosad.html,"Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
Cuz I had to say goodbye

By now I should know
That in time things would change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

How can I adjust
To the way that things are going
It's killing me slowly
Oh I just want it to be how it used to be

Cuz I wish that I could stay
But in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why oh 

By now I should know that
That in time things would change
So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

By now by now I should know
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind
So why do I feel so sad
If it couldn't be that bad
Tell me why

By now I should know
That in time things would change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

Mad World,Alex Parks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alexparks/madworld.html,"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world
Mad world, mad world, mad world",2003
The World at Large,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/theworldatlarge.html,"Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud.",2004
So Sorry,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/sosorry.html,"I'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh actions of mine
When patience is in short supply

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh we, we could hold each other tight tonight

We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the ocean
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
No the answer isn't for us

[Live Version:
Oh, I'm sorry
But I'm hanging up my hat
No, I just can't go on
Mmm, that's how I feel until I hear that song]

I'm sorry
Two words I always think
Oh after you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
We, we could hold each other tight tonight
Tonight

I Don't Love You,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mychemicalromance/idontloveyou.html,"Well, when you go
So never think, I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

Well, after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
Is where you ought to stay

Well, after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
Whoa, whoa

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Well, come on, come on

When you go
Would you have the guts to say
""I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday""

I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday

I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday",2006
Ice Water,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/icewater.html,"Like I heard her backwards saying
""I can take one thousand showers
and never be clean""
Of course she lied awake

She is ten times heavier
Stronger, than you found the grave
Or ever was
He's got it down now

You know what I need
Who doesn't lie?
You know what I mean

If I'm ever in doubt you
Like you don't know
I am so, angry
I am so, at ease
I feel just like
Some great big disease

I think you need
Ice water
But the only thing that
You really hate
Is all its emptiness
I will swim
And I will drink myself to
Death

If I'm never in
Doubt of you
Like you don't know",1996
Under the Bridge,Red Hot Chili Peppers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/redhotchilipeppers/underthebridge.html,"Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away",1991
Glory Box,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/glorybox.html,"I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look from outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
It's all I wanna be is all woman

For this is the beginning of forever and ever

It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Just give me a reason to love you",1994
Existentialism On Prom Night,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/existentialismonpromnight.html,"When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would....

Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything.",2004
I Am a Rock,Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/iamarock.html,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",1966
If You're Not the One,Daniel Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielbedingfield/ifyourenottheone.html,"If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?",2002
Time After Time,Cyndi Lauper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cyndilauper/timeaftertime.html,"Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Torn,Natalie Imbruglia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natalieimbruglia/torn.html,"I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

But you crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn",1998
She's Lost Control,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/sheslostcontrol.html,"Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.
And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And of a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.

And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

Well I had to phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.
But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

I could live a little better with the myths and the lies,
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried.
I could live a little in a wider line,
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone,
To lose control. When here we come.",1979
Just Hold Me,Maria Mena,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariamena/justholdme.html,"Comfortable as I am, 
I need your reassurance 
Comfortable as you are, 
You count the days 
But if I wanted silence I would whisper 
If I wanted loneliness I'd choose to go 
If I liked rejection I'd audition 
And if I didn't love you, you would know 

And why can't you just hold me? 
And how come it's so hard? 
And do you like to see me broken? 
And why do I still care? 

Still care

You say you see the light now 
at the end of this narrow hall 
I wish it didn't matter 
I wish I didn't give you all 

But if I wanted silence I would whisper 
If I wanted loneliness I'd choose to go 
If I liked rejection I'd audition 
And if I didn't love you, you would know 

So why can't you just hold me 
How come it's so hard? 
Do you like to see me broken? 
Why do I still care? 

Poor little misunderstood baby 
No one likes a sad face 
But I can't remember life without him 
I think I did have good days 
I'm sure I did have good days 

And why...and why can't you just hold me?
And how come it's so hard? 
And do you like to see me broken? 
And why do I still care?",2006

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life",2003
Otherside,Red Hot Chili Peppers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/redhotchilipeppers/otherside.html,"[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

How long I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever",1999
No One's Gonna Love You,Band of Horses,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bandofhorses/noonesgonnaloveyou.html,"It's looking like a limb torn off
Or altogether just taken apart
We're reeling through an endless fog
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was

But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

And anything to make you smile
It is a better side of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then back to another one

And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

But someone,
They could have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down
Hard

And anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you say
That you'd be better off
Or you'd like it that way

And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

But someone
They should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down

Protect Me from What I Want,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/protectmefromwhatiwant.html,"It's the disease of the age
It's the disease that we crave
Alone at the end of the rave
We catch the last bus home

Corporate America wakes
Coffee republic and cakes
We open the latch on the gate
Of the hole that we call our home

Protect me from what I want...
Protect me protect me

Maybe we're victims of fate
Remember when we'd celebrate
We'd drink and get high until late
And now we're all alone

Wedding bells ain't gonna chime
With both of us guilty of crime
And both of us sentenced to time
And now we're all alone

Protect me from what I want...
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want...
Protect me protect me

Protect me from what I want...
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want...

What If,Coldplay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/whatif.html,"What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time

That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life
What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break

That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Wake Up Alone,Amy Winehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amywinehouse/wakeupalone.html,"It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

His fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
There's this ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

His fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone",2007
Two Beds and a Coffee Machine,Savage Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savagegarden/twobedsandacoffeemachine.html,"and she takes another step
slowly she opens the door
check that he is sleeping
pick up all the broken glass
and furniture on the floor
been up half the night screaming
now it's time to get away
pack up the kids in the car
another bruise to try and hide
another alibi to write
another ditch in the road
you keep moving
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
wonder how I ever made it through

and there are children to think of
baby's asleep in the back seat
wonder how they'll ever make it
through this living nightmare
but the mind is an amazing thing
full of candy dreams and new toys
and another cheap hotel
two beds and a coffee machine
but there are groceries to buy
and she knows she'll have to go home

another ditch in the road
you keep moving 
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
wonder how I ever made it through

another bruise to try and hide 
another alibi to write
another lonely highway in the black of night
there's hope in the darkness
I know you're gonna make it

another ditch in the road
keep moving
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
silent fortress built to last

Play Crack the Sky,Brand New,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brandnew/playcrackthesky.html,"We sent out the SOS call.
It was a quarter past four in the morning when the storm broke our second anchor line.
Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.
They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.
One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.
What they call love is a risk, cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own.
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out.
And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow.
Your tongue is a rudder.
It steers the whole ship.
Sends your words past your lips or keeps them safe behind your teeth.
But the wrong words will strand you.
Come off course while you sleep.
Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reef.
The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.
To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.
And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.
But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm.
But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.
We won't have to fight for long.
This is the end.
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear.
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath.
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea.
I spoke the words but never gave a thought to what they all could mean.
I know that this is what you want.
A funeral keeps both of us apart.
You know that you are not alone.
Need you like water in my lungs.
This is the end.",2003

i will make my way, through, one more day in hell...
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...
i will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
i'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey i won't change direction, and i won't change my mind
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make..
how much difference...
i'll swallow poison, until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room

Did we imagine half of it

The last mistake before you die

Oh Mother,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/ohmother.html,"Whoa, oh, yeah,

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again

So mother, I thank you
For all that you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over,
""You deserve much more than this.""

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)
Together we always pull through.
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again

For everytime he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)
Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)
Together we always pull through (always pull through)
We always pull through

Never Too Late,Three Days Grace,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/threedaysgrace/nevertoolate.html,"This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

No one will ever see
This side reflected
And if there's something wrong
Who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like
It's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

The world we knew
Won't come back
The time we've lost
Can't get it back
The life we had
Won't be ours again

This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive

You're Not Sorry,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/yourenotsorry.html,"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

I can't even try

I'm in over my head
You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in

And my knees are weak
And my mouth can't speak
Fell too far this time

In ways undefined

Help me baby (help me now)

Like the sand to the tide
Flowing into your arms
Falling into your eyes

I might lose my mind

Just a Dream,Carrie Underwood,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carrieunderwood/justadream.html,"It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt.""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh,
Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance

I'll keep stealing, breathing her.
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending 
One of us will die inside these arms 
Eyes wide open, naked as we came 
One will spread our ashes 'round the yard 

She says ""If I leave before you, darling 
Don't you waste me in the ground"" 
I lay smiling like our sleeping children 
One of us will die inside these arms 
Eyes wide open, naked as we came 
One will spread our ashes round the yard",2004
A Long December,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/alongdecember.html,"A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California...I think you should
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass
And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should",1996

You're gone from here
And soon you will disappear
Fading into beautiful light
Cause everybody's changing

Don't Give Up,Peter Gabriel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petergabriel/dontgiveup.html,"in this proud land we grew up strong
we were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

no fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose

don't give up
'cos you have friends
don't give up
you're not beaten yet
don't give up
I know you can make it good

though I saw it all around
never thought I could be affected
thought that we'd be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn

drove the night toward my home
the place that I was born, on the lakeside
as daylight broke, I saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground

don't give up
you still have us
don't give up
we don't need much of anything
don't give up
'cause somewhere there's a place
where we belong

rest your head
you worry too much
it's going to be alright
when times get rough
you can fall back on us
don't give up
please don't give up

'got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
going to stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing
that river's flowing

moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job, so many men
so many men no-one needs

don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not the only one
don't give up
no reason to be ashamed
don't give up
you still have us
don't give up now
we're proud of who you are
don't give up
you know it's never been easy
don't give up
'cause I believe there's a place
there's a place where we belong",1986
Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/setfiretotherain.html,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh!

Oh, no
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn",2011
Romeo and Juliet,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/romeoandjuliet.html,"A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like ""You and me babe: how 'bout it?""

Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo. You nearly give me a heart attack.""
He's underneath the window; she's singing, ""Hey, la, my boyfriend's back.
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that.
Anyway what you gonna do about it?""

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah.
Now you just say, ""Oh, Romeo, yeah. You know, I used to have a scene with him.""

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
And says something like ""You and me babe: how 'bout it?""

""You and me babe: how about it?""",1980

I would only be in your way

And I... will always love you

Why Does It Always Rain on Me?,Travis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/travis/whydoesitalwaysrainonme.html,"I can't sleep tonight
Everybody saying everything's alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights 

Sunny days
Where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning 

I can't stand myself
I'm being held up by an invisible man
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

Everyday Is Like Sunday,Morrissey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morrissey/everydayislikesunday.html,"Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench
Where your clothes were stolen

This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddonâcome, Armageddon! Come, Armageddon! Come!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard,
""How I dearly wish I was not here.""

In the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Comeânuclear bomb!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face, on your face, on your face, on your face

Everyday is like Sunday
""Win Yourself A Cheap Tray""
Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey",1988

Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/goodriddancetimeofyourlife.html,"Fuck...

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life",1997
Good Enough,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/goodenough.html,"Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough for you

Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself, and I don't mind
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough
Its been such a long time coming, but I feel good

And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
Am I good enough for you to love me too?

So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no",2006
Dirty Little Secret,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/dirtylittlesecret.html,"If I had the chance, love
I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late

Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
I am willing, to give up this fight

I've been up all night drinking
To drown my sorrow down
Nothing seems to help me since you went away
I'm so tired of this town
Where every tongue is wagging
When every back is turned
They're telling secrets that should never be revealed
There's nothing to be gained from this
But disaster...
Here's a good one...
Did you hear about my friend
He's embarrassed to be seen now
because we all know his sins

If I had the chance love
You know, I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late

Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
I am willing, to give up this fight
Oh, I am willing to give up this fight...",2003
When She Loved Me,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/whenshelovedme.html,"When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy, so was I, when she loved me.

Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me.

So the years went by, I stayed the same
But she began to drift away, I was left alone
Still I waited for the day, when sheâd say ""I will always love you.""

Lonely and forgotten, never thought sheâd look my way,
And she smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do,
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful,
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
When she loved me.",

In the End,Linkin Park,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/linkinpark/intheend.html,"[Chester Bennington:]
It starts with one
[Mike Shinoda:]
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

[Chester Bennington:]
All I know
[Mike Shinoda:] Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

[Chester Bennington:]
It's so unreal

It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Chester Bennington:]
Watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chester Bennington:]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard

I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

[Chester Bennington:]
Got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

In the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down,Interpol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/interpol/stellawasadiverandshewasalwaysdown.html,"When she walks down the street,
She knows there's people watching.
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Days
Daze
Days
Daze

She was all right because the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She is all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight, air tight
She broke away, broke away

At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
From crevices caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells
Stella, Stella, Stella, Stella I love you

[Chorus]

Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, love-joy diver
She went down down down there into the sea,
Yeah she went down down down there, down there for me, right on

So good, oh yeah, right on

There's some things you can't hide,

Place to Be,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/placetobe.html,"When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place

And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be

And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh, so weak in this need for you",1972

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter

I know that she hurts you, but remember I love you, too

I ran away today, ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)

Half Life,Imogen Heap,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/imogenheap/halflife.html,"I knew that I'd get like this again
That's why I try to keep at bay
Be a hundred percent when I'm with you and then
A perfect heart's length away

The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
You never promised me anything
Even sat me down, warned me just how they fall
And I knew the odds were I'd never win

yet here I am
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been 2 days and 8 minutes too slow
There may well be others but I still like to pretend
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with

You've got a schedule to stick to
Got a world to keep sweet
You're so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down? Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts to sign
Hold me darling, please

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

You know you'll never be lonely
You know you'll always be loved
And maybe you'll never need more than that
But of the surplus that loves, what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?

Long for one last showdown
From a box in the crowd, air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life",2009
Too Much Love Will Kill You,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/toomuchlovewillkillyou.html,"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long

I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down

How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all.
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end.",1995
Into the West,Annie Lennox,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annielennox/intothewest.html,"Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You've come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass

Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say,
""We have come now to the end.""
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again

And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the West",
Wire to Wire,Razorlight,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/razorlight/wiretowire.html,"What is love but the strangest of feelings?
A sin you swallow for the rest of your life?
You've been looking for someone to believe in
To love you until your eyes run dry

She lives by disillusion glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar
Love me, wherever you are

How do you love with a fate full of rust?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
You've been looking for someone you can trust
To love you, again and again

How do you love in a house without feelings?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
I've been looking for someone to believe in
Love me, again and again

She lives by disillusion's glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar

How do you love on a night without feelings?
She says, love, I hear sound, I see fury
She says, love's not a hostile condition
Love me, wherever you are

Love me, wherever you are
Love me, wherever you are

Only You,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/onlyyou.html,"We suffer everyday, what is it for
These crimes of illusion, are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight, it's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see, in this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart",1997
First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/firstdayofmylife.html,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005
Heart of Gold,Neil Young,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/heartofgold.html,"I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
You keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold

Bridge over Troubled Water,Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/bridgeovertroubledwater.html,"When you're weary, feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind",1970
You Were Meant For Me,Jewel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jewel/youweremeantforme.html,"I hear the clock, it's six A.M.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you.

I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore

Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.

I called my mamma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used

Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad
'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, every day.

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down.
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone

Bed Of Roses,Bon Jovi,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bonjovi/bedofroses.html,"Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano,
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head,
And some blonde gave me nightmares.
I think that she's still in my bed.
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead.

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French-kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe:
About love, the truth, what you mean to me.
And the truth is,
Baby, you're all that I need.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

Well, I'm so far away.
Each step that I take is on my way home.
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this pay-phone.
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through.
'Til the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
""Baby, blind love is true.""

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry.
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye.
Well, I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died.

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you.
While my mistressâshe calls me
To stand in her spotlight again.

Tonight I won't be alone,
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely.
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.",1992

I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot

Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

That she could feel 

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought I wouldn't have to be with you
Something new

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know that you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
You left my heart soaking wet
Boy your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
With me
Hiding

Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn't choose between
The shower or the bath

And I thought I wouldn't have to be
With you
A magazine

No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's clear he's gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you safe?
Now we're through?

What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
growing increasingly unclear.

I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
all the other options held before me,
would wither in the light of my plan.

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,

And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold

These Are the Days of Our Lives,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/thesearethedaysofourlives.html,"Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago.
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect. You know?

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young.
The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know.
The rest of my life's been just a show.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you.

You can't turn back the clock,
You can't turn back the tide.
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
When life was just a game.

No use sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives.
They've flown in the swiftness of time.
These days are all gone now,
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you.

Everything else is a waste of breath

I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling you might fall

I want you
You said ""Young man I do believe you're dying""
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
it's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
I want you
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""
I want you
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call his name out as he held you down
I want you
Oh no my darling not with that clown
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No-one who wants you could want you more
I want you
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
I want you
I want you
I'm going to say it again 'til I instill it
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
I want you
I want you",1986

I didn't mean it

I never felt

Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'
Wait a minute
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial
Tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life, baby
(in my life, in my life)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together, baby!

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together",2005
The Luckiest,Ben Folds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/theluckiest.html,"I don't get many things right the first time
In fact, I am told that a lot
Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls
Brought me here

And where was I before the day
That I first saw your lovely face?
Now I see it everyday
And I know

That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest

What if I'd been born fifty years before you
In a house on a street where you lived?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know

That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest

I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you

Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties
And one day passed away in his sleep
And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong
That I know

That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest",2001
Summer in the City,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/summerinthecity.html,"Summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage 
And I start to miss you, baby, sometimes 
I've been staying up and drinking in a late night establishment 
Telling strangers personal things 

Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely 
So I went to a protest just to rub up against strangers 
And I did feel like coming but I also felt like crying 
It doesn't seem so worth it right now 

And the castrated ones stand in the corner smoking 
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise 
At the site of a beautiful woman they feel nothing but 
Anger, her skin makes them sick in the night nauseaous, nauseaous, nauseaous 

Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely 
I've been hallucinating you, babe, at the backs of other women 
And I tap on their shoulder and they turn around smiling 
But there's no recognition in their eyes 

Oh summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage 
And don't get me wrong, dear, in general I'm doing quite fine 
It's just when it's summer in the city, and you're so long gone from the city 
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes 

When it's summer in the city 
And you're so long gone from the city 
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes 
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes 
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes",2006
Stay Together for the Kids,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/staytogetherforthekids.html,"It's hard to wake up, when the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
If this stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday

Disenchanted,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mychemicalromance/disenchanted.html,"Well, I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen,
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen.
I hate the ending myself,
But it started with an alright scene.

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing.
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, ""You won't feel a thing.""
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting

If I'm so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
How can you listen all night long, night long, night long?
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
Well, if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya

I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show 'em what we all mean

If I'm so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
How can you listen all night long, night long, night long?
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya

So go
Go away
Just go, run away.
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
But if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya, come on

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya at all
At all
At all
At all",2006

Smile all the time
Shine you teeth til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies

And whatevers going down
Will follow you around
Thats how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
Thats how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time",1998
Maybe Not,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/maybenot.html,"There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be

So we can do just one more thing
We can all be free

Maybe not with a look

Listen to me, don't walk that street
There's always an end to it
Come and be free, you know who I am
We're just living people

We won't have a thing
So we got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind

You've got to choose a wish or command
At the turn of the tide, is withering thee
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
Pray to be, shake this land

We won't have a thing
So we've got nothing to lose
We can all be free

Twenty Years,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/twentyyears.html,"There are twenty years to go
And twenty ways to know 
Who will wear, 
Who will wear 
The hat.

There are twenty years to go,
The best of all I hope.
Enjoy the ride, the medicine show.

And them's the breaks for we designer fakes.
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye.

There are twenty years to go,
The faithful and the low.
The best of starts, the broken heart, the stone.
There are twenty years to go,
The punch drunk and the blow.
The worst of starts, the mercy part, the phone.

And them's the breaks for we designer fakes.
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye.
And them's the breaks for we designer fakes.
But it's you I take 'cause you're the truth not I.

There are twenty years to go.
A golden age I know.
But all will pass, will end too fast, you know.

There are twenty years to go,
And many friends I hope.
Though some may hold the rose some hold the rope.

And that's the end and that's the start of it.
That's the whole and that's the part of it.
That's the high and that's the heart of it.
That's the long and that's the short of it.
That's the best and that's the test in it.
That's the doubt, the doubt,
The trust in it.
That's the sight and that's the sound of it.
That's the gift and that's the trick in it.

You're the truth not I.",2006

You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
But since we're not together
I pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

How could I have been the one?
I saw the world spin beneath you
And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Always someone there

And there's no time left for losin'
When you stand they fall, yeah

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Comin' down the years turn over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and

All because I'm
And I'll become
What you became to me",1998

Little voices whispering
That I should go and this should end
Oh and I found myself listening

All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could

That it was wrong or it was right
But you ain't leaving without a fight
And I think I am just as torn inside

And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you

And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
This is what I have to do

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you

Lover I Don't Have to Love,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/loveridonthavetolove.html,"I picked you out 
Of a crowd and talked to you 
Said I liked your shoes
You said thanks can I follow you?

And out of view
No prying eyes 
I poured some wine 
I asked your name you asked the time
Now it's two o'clock, 
the club is closed we're up the block
Your hands on me 
I'm pressing hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth 
Trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know 
Who else may have been you before
I want a lover I don't have to love 
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time 
You said it feels good I said I'll give it a try
Then my mind went dark 
We both forgot where your car was parked 
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning
Bad actors with bad habits 
Some sad singers 
They just play tragic
And the phone's ringing 
And the van's leaving 
Let's just keep touching
Let's just keep keep singing
I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind
But you but you 
You write such pretty words
But life's no story book 
Love's an excuse to get hurt 
And to hurt

""I do! I do!""
""Then hurt me."" [fades]",2002
Father And Son,Cat Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catstevens/fatherandson.html,"[Father:]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

[Son:]
How can I try to explain, cause when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

[Father:]
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

[Son:]
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me

The Closest Thing to Crazy,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/theclosestthingtocrazy.html,"How can I think I'm standing strong, 
Yet feel the air beneath my feet? 
How can happiness feel so wrong? 
How can misery feel so sweet? 
How can you let me watch you sleep, 
Then break my dreams the way you do? 
How can I have got in so deep? 
Why did I fall in love with you? 

[CHORUS:]
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been 
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen, 
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known, 
I was never crazy on my own... 
And now I know that there's a link between the two, 
Being close to craziness and being close to you. 

How can you make me fall apart 
Then break my fall with loving lies? 
It's so easy to break a heart; 
It's so easy to close your eyes. 
How can you treat me like a child 
Yet like a child I yearn for you? 
How can anyone feel so wild? 
How can anyone feel so blue?

Cat's in the Cradle,Harry Chapin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harrychapin/catsinthecradle.html,"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while""
He shook his head and said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
We're gonna have a good time then",1974
Thank You,Dido,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/thankyou.html,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

My Lover's Gone,Dido,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/myloversgone.html,"My lover's gone
his boots no longer by my door
he left at dawn
and as I slept I felt him go
Returns no more
I will not watch the ocean
My lover's gone
no earthly ships will ever bring him home again
bring him home again

My lover's gone
I know that kiss will be my last
no more his song
the tune upon his lips has passed

I sing alone
while I watch the ocean
My lover's gone
no earthly ships will ever bring him home again
bring him home again",1999
Tiny Tears,Tindersticks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tindersticks/tinytears.html,"You've been lying in bed for a week now
Wondering how long it'll take
You haven't spoken or looked at her in all that time
It's the easiest line you could break
She's been going about her business as usual
Always with that melancholy smile
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
To see those tiny tears in her eyes

Tiny tears make up an ocean
Tiny tears make up a sea
Let them pour out, pour out all over
Don't let them pour all over me

How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
Someone you said you'd always be there for
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
When those tears start rolling you'll be back

Tiny tears...

You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
But now it seems that moment has arrived
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight

Tiny tears...",1995
The River,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/theriver.html,"I come from down in the valley 
where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
when she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
and man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
and the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
they haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
that sends me down to the river 
though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight 
Down to the river 
my baby and I 
Oh down to the river we ride",1980
Say It Right,Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/sayitright.html,"In the day
In the night
Say it right
Say it all
You either got it
Or you don't
You either stand or you fall

When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonight you tonight

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you
Another brick that I laid
From my body I could show you
A place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?

Three, four

You don't mean nothing at all to me
You don't mean nothing at all to me",2006
Photograph,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/photograph.html,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me...",2005

And so convinced and just too cool

I wish I could still call you friend

Map of the Problematique,Muse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/mapoftheproblematique.html,"Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same

Get it right

One,Aimee Mann,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aimeemann/one.html,"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one

""No"" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

One is the loneliest number, much much worse than two
One is the number divided by two

One,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/one.html,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
If you've got someone to blame?

You said one love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing now
It's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other and we're doing it again

You said love is a temple
Love the higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law

You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
I can't be holding on
To what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should
One life with each other

One life but we're not the same

Landlocked Blues,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/landlockedblues.html,"If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And ones pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up I say ""enough is enough,
If you walk away, I'll walk away""
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon 

And the world's got me dizzy again
You think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
If you love something, give it away

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke 
We're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
Cause we're coming for you!

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying ""let me walk away, please""
You'll be free child once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn
Putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to",2005

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Holding your scarred heart in hand

Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
But we know that you are gone

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night, thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time, that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same
That was until the day before the day",2008
Everything Means Nothing To Me,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/everythingmeansnothingtome.html,"Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
Who keeps singing over everything
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
I picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
The reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me",2000
My Last Breath,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/mylastbreath.html,"Hold on to me, love
You know I can't stay long
All I wanted to say was, ""I love you and I'm not afraid.""
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me in your arms?

[Chorus:]
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light it ends here tonight

I'll miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears

[Chorus]

Closing your eyes to disappear,
You pray your dreams will leave you here;
But still you wake and know the truth,
No one's there...

Say goodnight,
Don't be afraid,
Calling me, calling me as you fade to black.

(Say goodnight) Holding my last breath
(Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself
(Calling me, calling me) Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight

[Chorus]

(Holding my last breath)",2003
Tom Traubert's Blues,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/tomtraubertsblues.html,"Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
In your silhouette window light go
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs,
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows, go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on an
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers
And goodnight to Mathilda, too",1976
The First Days Of Spring,Noah and the Whale,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/noahandthewhale/thefirstdaysofspring.html,"It's the first day of spring
And my life is starting over again
Well the trees grow, the river flows
And its water will wash away my sin
For I do believe that everyone
has one chance to fuck up their lives
Like a cut down tree, I will rise again
I'll be bigger, and stronger than ever before

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back

There's a hope in every new seed
And every flower that grows on the Earth
And though I love you, and you know that
Well I no longer know what that's worth
And I'll come back to you, in a year or so
And rebuild ready to become
Oh the person, you believed in
Or the person that you used to love

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back",2009
There Is,Box Car Racer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boxcarracer/thereis.html,"this vacation's useless
these white pills aren't kind
i've given  a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
i've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
the days have come and gone
our lives went by so fast
i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
where i laid and told you but you swear you loved me more

do you care if i don't know what to say?
will you sleep tonight, will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend it's all okay
that there's someone out there who feels just like me
there is

those notes you wrote me
i've kept them all
i've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
with every single letter in every single word there
will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl
do you care if i don't know what to say?
will you sleep tonight, will you think of me
will i shake this off
pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me

Demolition Lovers,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mychemicalromance/demolitionlovers.html,"Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition too
I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things we put each other through and

I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running

But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me

Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this

Perfect,Simple Plan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simpleplan/perfect.html,"Hey dad look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that
I'm alright
And you can't change me

Nothing lasts forever

I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and
We can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry

Nothing's gonna make this right again (right again)

I can't find in between

and I have been with a queen

it wouldn't have worked out any way
so now it's just another lonely day
further along we just may
but for now it's just another lonely day

wish there was something
I could say or do
I can resist anything
but temptation from you
but I'd rather walk alone
than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself
than let you drag me down

it wouldn't have worked out any way
and now it's just another lonely day
further along we just may
but for now it's just another lonely day

yesterday seems like a life ago
cause the one I love
today I hardly know
you I held so close in my heart oh dear
grow further from me

Split Screen Sadness,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/splitscreensadness.html,"And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
Where you say it's alright
You got your heart right

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat
Wait on the porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight

We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight [x4]

""All you need is love"" is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters

And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat
Wait on the porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

[x2]
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)

I called because I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right...
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right...
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right...

Not as We,Alanis Morissette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/notaswe.html,"Reborn and shivering
Spat out on new terrain

Unsure unconvincing
This faint and shaky hour

Day one day one start over again
Step one step one
I'm barely making sense for now
I'm faking it 'til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we

Gun shy and quivering
Timid without a hand

Feign brave with steel intent
Little and hardly here

Day one day one start o-over again
Step one step one
With not much making sense just yet
I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we

Eyes wet toward
Wide open frayed
If God's taking bets
I pray He wants to lose

Day one day one start over again
Step one step one
I'm barely making sense just yet
I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we",2008
Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,Alicia Keys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliciakeys/trysleepingwithabrokenheart.html,"Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Need me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end Oh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's bout to fall apart
So rather than hold onto a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you",2009

They're my own veins.
Any more than a whisper,
Any sudden movement of my heart.
And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away

Just get through this day

Give up your way, you could be anything,
Give up my way, and lose myself, not today
That's too much guilt to pay

Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way

You're just so pretty in your pain

Give up my way, and I could be anything
I'll make my own way
Without your senseless hate... hate... hate... hate.

So run, run, run
And hate me, if it feels good.
I can't hear your screams anymore

You lied to me
But I'm older now
And I'm not buying baby

Demanding my response
Don't bother breaking the door down
I found my way out

And you'll never hurt me again.",2016

Bottom of the Ocean,Miley Cyrus,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mileycyrus/bottomoftheocean.html,"It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you baby

But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes

I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?

I have to know why
I had to lose you

Do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I'll draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep re-living

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?

I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become

For me to, baby, ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy
Cause I don't want to hold you
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy

Title and Registration,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/titleandregistration.html,"The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it.
So i'm proposing a swift orderly change.

Cause behind its door there's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all i find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life.

I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When i stumbled upon pictures i tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head

Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here i rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all

Things Behind the Sun,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/thingsbehindthesun.html,"Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth

Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say?

Look around you find the ground
Is not so far from where you are
But donât be too wise

For down below they never grow
Theyâre always tired and charms are hired
From out of their eyes

Never surprise

Take your time and youâll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see whatâs meant to be
Donât name the day or try to say
It happened before

Donât be shy you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done
If only you see

Just what you are beneath a star
That came to stay one rainy day
In autumn for free

Yes, be what youâll be

Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while 
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth
Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say

Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes thatâs today
And open wide the hymns you hide
Youâll find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what youâll say

About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people round your head
Who say everythingâs been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain",1972
River Man,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/riverman.html,"Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves.

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me.

Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go.",1969
Right Here Waiting,Richard Marx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardmarx/rightherewaiting.html,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you",1989
In My Life,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/inmylife.html,"There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life
I love you more",2002
Someone Great,LCD Soundsystem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lcdsoundsystem/someonegreat.html,"I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming, 
Till the day it stops
[x3]
And it keeps coming,
[x7]
Till the day it stops.

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I could have started,
Too late, for beginnings.
You're smaller than my wife imagined,
Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.
[x8]

We're safe, for the moment.
Saved, 
For the moment.",2007
You Know I'm No Good,Amy Winehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amywinehouse/youknowimnogood.html,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy
He's in a place, but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we're married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet

Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good",2007
Coma White,Marilyn Manson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/comawhite.html,"There's something cold and blank behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass in her miracle mile

'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away
Today, today, today to run away

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut
And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a Polaroid
That lost all her dolls

You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away
Today, today, today to run away

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away
Today

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself",1998
Only in Dreams,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/onlyindreams.html,"You can't resist her
She's in your bones
She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide 

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 

You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, 'Hey baby
I just might take the chance'
You say, 'It's a good thing
That you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way
I will crush your pretty
Toenails into a thousand pieces.' 

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 

Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...",1994
I Love You,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/iloveyou.html,"I have a smile
stretched from ear to ear
to see you walking down the road

we meet at the lights
I stare for a while
the world around us disappears

just you and me
on my island of hope
a breath between us could be miles

let me surround you
my sea to your shore
let me be the calm you seek

oh and every time I'm close to you
there's too much I can't say
and you just walk away

and I forgot
to tell you
I love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you 
I grieve in my condition
for I cannot find the words to say I need you so

oh and every time I'm close to you
there's too much I can't say
and you just walk away

and I forgot
to tell you
I love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you",1997
Total Eclipse of the Heart,Bonnie Tyler,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bonnietyler/totaleclipseoftheheart.html,"(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then
I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

[Instrumental interlude]

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

Other Side of the World,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/othersideoftheworld.html,"Over the sea and far away
She's waiting like an iceberg
Waiting to change
But she's cold inside
She wants to be like the water

All the muscles tighten in her face
Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same
Just like water

[Chorus:]
The fire fades away
Most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world to me

On comes the panic light
Holding on with fingers and feelings alike
But the time has come
To move along

[Chorus]

Can you help me?
Can you let me go
And can you still love me
When you can't see me anymore

[Chorus]",2004
