Yellow Submarine,The Beatles,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

In an octopus's garden near a cave

The coral that lies beneath the waves

Knowing they're happy and they're safe

Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form

For Once in My Life,Stevie Wonder,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
gotta love the BPM.
When the smoke was all baton
Remembering how this begun.
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
Where the future plays it all night long.

Penny Lane,The Beatles,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes

Disregarding bombs and satellites.

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go

Things will be great when you're
Downtown
No finer place for sure

Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows
Downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close
Downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go

Where all the lights are bright

Waiting for you tonight

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

And the bright lights turn to night
Until the dawn it brings

Others only read of the love, the love that I love.

Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was asleep

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

You hear November Rain
That solo's awful long

My Rollercoaster,Kimya Dawson,"You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
And if home is really where the heart is
Then we're the smartest kids I know
Because wherever we are in this great big world
We'll never be more than a few hours from home... 

And that's important because I need to travel
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And before I had a mini van I road the greyhound bus
My mom would say ""i hope some day you get paid for being kimya dawson"" 

And now I do and it's not much
But it's enough
I've got my scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy 

On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again 

From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be do do do do do do
I'll be the greatest man of your life 

'cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes
And playing video games in the middle of the night
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride it'll be out of sight
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Four five six seven minutes in the closet 

You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
You know just when to jump off
You're so brave
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight 

Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs

While trying to restructure my character

And through many dreadful nights
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
And waiting for some high times to come again

We make love to some weird sin
We seek out the taciturn

Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms

Nouns, and books, and show and tell

Go to the shop, make plans to be leaving 
In the morning

Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
An alley cat chewing on dead leaves
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

When I leave, I try not to wake her
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
In the morning

She wrote my name on a red telephone box
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

And all this time I've watched it change
But it's still the same

That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight

And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

When my face is chamois creased
If you think I wink, I did
Laugh politely at repeats
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin

And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Stumbling over what to say

Could we make it better, stormy weather?

And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter

But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one
Who doesn't like to be gone?

Let him slowly figure it out

Telepathic beautiful creature 
Understanding all of my weakness 
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it 

Cynical and hurt was just me

Part of what I would call amazing 
Took so long to finally see

Give back when I can, just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry, mustard, hot sauce
Light bread and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bop

Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few, and put up your deuce
If it's beef, put down the peace down, throw up your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your â
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind

And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well I'll look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say
""Yah well I feel all pretty happy too""
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it'll be love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking about them as I'm lying in bed
And I know that I believe, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time I might not know you
In five years time we might not speak
In five years time we might not get along
In five years time you might just prove me wrong

Oh there'll be love love love

But wait the babies haven't been born
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Rambling rose
Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold",2004,happy

Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore

There was a little old lady, who was walking down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
I believe that it's called al fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand

But before she had time to accept it
hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now

So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away
Listen to me, I'm not
Although I'm dressed up, out and all with
Everything considered they forget my name

Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
Though I realize, I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around, but just a promise, nothing binding
However can't you see, that you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-along, this song is monotone

Hold each other close the whole night through

Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
All twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say

In the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws
Out of big fat Slurpee treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come

Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

That God himself did make

But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio,
I hope this song will guide you home

But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin

And that frankly will not fly.
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

You know I don't find this stuff
Amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, woe my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my role model is
Gone gone?""
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatter-lings and orphanages

He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen!"" and ""Hallelujah!""

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me

Na na na na â¦

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty

You Get What You Give,New Radicals,"Wake up kids
We've got the dreamer's disease
Age 14
We got you down on your knees
So polite,
We're busy still saying please

Frienemies,
Who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night
We smash their Mercedes-Benz
First we run
And then we laugh 'til we cry

[Pre-chorus:]
But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light, light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

[Chorus:]
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home baby
You're tops, give it to me now

Four A.M. we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke but hey we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial

[Pre-chorus:]
But when the night is falling
You cannot find your friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend

[Chorus]

This whole damn world can fall apart
You'll be OK, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
(don't give up)
Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance rip off lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson,
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around
We'll kick your ass in!

Don't let go
One dance left

But you were fucking that girl next door, what you do that for (what you do that for)?
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

You! Me! Dancing!,Los Campesinos!,"The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis
Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed

And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were its not the scene you're thinking of
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
If only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing

And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Says as long as we're here everything is alright

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

One thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

And I always get confused,
because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
but in discos they turn them on.
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.

we're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy.",P:  ,happy
Birdhouse in Your Soul,They Might Be Giants,"I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend

It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells

Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts

Like guardian angels its always near

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall

Now that I'm all on my own.

My, how you have grown!

Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Or raise them up to beg for scraps,
You know, he's holding you down
With the tips of his fingers just the same,
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late,
Or changed by a potion,
And find a handsome young mate
For you to love.

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe,
Well do it now or grow old,
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.

Been alone since you were twenty-one,
You haven't laughed since January,
You try and make like this is so much fun,
But we know it to be quite contrary.

But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,

And washed it away down the kitchen sink

Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that

I'm a Believer,The Monkees,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing,
Seems the more I gave the less I got.
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain.
When I needed sunshine I got rain.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!

The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night

What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying
""I love you""

That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

In darkness she is all I see

Driving slow on Sunday morning

Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002,happy

The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger

She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear she'd seen the thing
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas

She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Burning solid
Burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes

I dragged you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs

Things aren't always just what they seem

I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick,
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life,
So I quickly opened the wardrobe,
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean,
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes,
That were ripped around the seams,
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me.

Hey, I put some new shoes on,
And suddenly everything is right,
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling,
It's so inviting,
Oh, short on money,
But long on time,
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
And I'm running late,
And I don't need an excuse,
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.

Woke up late one Thursday,
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes,
And I felt like there were two days missing,
As I focused on the time,
And I made my way to the kitchen,
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found,
A room full of all off my friends all dancing round and round,
And I thought hello new shoes,
Bye bye them blues.

Take me wandering through these streets,
Where bright lights and angels meet,
Stone to stone they take me on,
I'm walking till' the break of dawn. [x2]

Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you

Try to understand why,
don't get so close to change my mind.
Please wipe that look out of your eyes,

Simply, it's tiring.

This love has dried up and stayed behind,
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide.
Excuse me first love, but we're through.
I need to taste a kiss from someone new.

No Man's Land,Sufjan Stevens,"Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours; this land is mine.
I see the Captain in red,
and Cairo at his head.
This land is yours; this land is mine.

The lightning over the park,
the waters--brash and dark
We take a swim; we take a swim.
I never meant to escape
the carpet and the trade
This land is yours; this land is mine.

And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back; I take it back.
The numbers over the dam,
Jo Davies and the band,
I count them out; I count them out.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
to the floor

The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
In Charles, we climb the hill 
and Danville window sill
I take it back; I take it back.
My sister she counts the bars,
the Macon county cars,
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.

The Mississippi amends
the Carver and the bends
This land is yours; this land is mine.
My brother punches my ear.
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad; I call my dad.
We skip inside of the store
the Mason winter door
This land is yours; this land is mine.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can,
ransacks with the mad man.
For this land is not yours or mine to have.
This land was made for the good of itself.)",2006,happy
Freckles,Natasha Bedingfield,"I used to care so much about what others think about
Almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark
On the journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
If I knew then what I know now
I would have told myself don't worry any longer it's OK

[Chorus:]
'cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable,
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me
Sometimes I still feel like the little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm getting better
And I'm reminding myself

[Chorus]

Reflecting who you are
Reflecting who you are
Hmmm
Whoooooo whoa hmmmm oooooo

I'm All Over It,Jamie Cullum,"Hello Innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing
How I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one
And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please

Let me go
Don't you know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I tried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

She's a melody
That I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me
When I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't fight
That song going round in my head
Like the last things you said

Please don't go
You think I know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change but I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back

She left without a warning
And took the red-eye back to London town

Have a way of getting what they want

Until that day we'd never heard its name

Headstart For Happiness,The Style Council,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.",1983,happy

Dog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and me

No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone

All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)
Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""

Dreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbed

Changing her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said,

He knows just how to make me happy, he gives me loves and calls me Daddy.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, c'mon giggle for me.

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall. It just blows me away to be part of it all.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, just singing these love songs for you.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, there ain't nothing that I'd rather do.
I like to see you with a smile on your face, I'd like to give one to the whole human race

The Man Who Can't Be Moved,The Script,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, ""If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?""

I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go""

There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm

I'm the man who can't be moved

Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see

I thought that Alcohol was just for those with
nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time
and there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
self-control and self-abuse

I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Would you please ignore that you
found me on the floor
Trying on your camisole?
O Alcohol, would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

Would you please forgive me?

We're kissing without kissing... got it down to a fine art.
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky; we grew up and wide apart.
Not now, not ever, no... it's never a good time.

Comparing photos then and now.

And I'm pretty sure, baby, if you'd hold my head
I could live like I've wished for and undo my dread
Cause I see candygrams up in the ceiling tiles
Witty postcards sent off from the sandwich aisles
And these towns where vacations will lead us
I'll hold out my treasures and their welfare feed us
But oh she does what she wishes
And, no, she won't be your missus
The kingdom it widens and no, they're alone with all that love and the void on your throne

His shed to mend,

It wrecks me how they justify their acts

How well the cause evades
Infecting your religions, claiming pacts

Happiness is easy

To recognize excuse before it acts
From love & conviction to pray

Frightened by her own shadow

Every night there the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear it coming
I could hear the sirens sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on
Time'll leak and lead you on
Still it's such beautiful night

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?

The Tuning Of Violins,Darren Hayes,"Daylight breaks, and the black birds call-
And the market stalls are all filling up, spilling over the streets.
High above, over Notting Hill-
I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

[Chorus:]
On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh-
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends-
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

[Chorus x2]

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.
Yeah we will unravel, unravel the moments.

Oh...

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will come to your window.

some do not

that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not

Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters

But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners

Feel,Bombay Bicycle Club,"I can feel it now that you've gone 
I have made you all that I want
I know you're keeping to your own sound 
you're running out of sight when the light goes down
Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one
And the world went on but I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling

Just one feeling, just one feeling

Coconut Grove,The Lovin' Spoonful,"It's really true how nothin' matters.
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters.
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters
In coconut grove.

Don't bar the door
There's no one comin'.
The ocean's roar will dull the drummin'
of any city thoughts or city ways.
The ocean breezes cool my mind,
The salty days are her's and mine
Just to do what we wanna.

Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly we will see the stars
Until sun up.

Somewhere Around Here,Chairlift,"Near the east Waverly Hills, your hair pinned back
In previous lives, we were frozen sticks
But these aren't so rigid
I throw off my coat to feel this January air

They wrote a book for the two of us
To read our books on
The darkest light before a darker night
We slip underwater
The bridge disappears, the deer hunt is in the frigid air

Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here

Just Another Girl,The Killers,"[Verse 1]
Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house
Nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl (another girl)

[Verse 2]
I went to see a fortune teller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl

[Bridge]
I could be reeling them in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

Then why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
The sound's off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world

Don't let her stick it to your heart, boy

The inside jokes and the changing style.

I leave behind,

Salty holding us steer

Skinny skinny skinny man with a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast to be swallowed let it last

I'm swimming with all my slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting

Tell me how you color all the empty space.
Drawn outside the lines,
your words, a vibrant illustration you create.

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole,
Deep down into an old slope.
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go,
Spinning out of control

The Magic Number,De La Soul,"(Got to have soul!) 

[POS:]
3 
That's the Magic Number 
Yes it is 
It's the magic number 
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community 
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me 
And that's the magic number 

(What does it all mean?) 

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
Measure in my music, raised in three parts 
Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky 
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires 
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet 
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

Everybody wants to be a deejay 
Everybody wants to be an emcee 
But being speakers are the best 
And you don't have to guess 
De La Soul posse consists of three 
And that's the magic number 

[DOVE:]
This here piece of the pie 
Is not dessert but the course that we dine 
And three out of every darn time 
The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind 
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
When that negative number fills up the casualty 
Maybe you can subtract it 
You can call it your lucky partner 
Maybe you can call it your adjective 
But odd as it may be 
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
My 3 
Mase Pos and Me 
And that's the Magic Number 

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
Time is a factor so it's time to count 
Count not the negative actions of one 
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 

Now you may try to subtract it 
But it just won't go away 
Three times one? 
(What is it?) 
(One, two, three!) 
And that's the Magic Number 

(Yo, what's up?) 
(1, 2, 3) 
(I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
(I wouldn't lie to you) 
(No more no less, that's the magic number) 
(No more no less) 
(What it is?) 
(No more no less) 
(Is this the future?) 
(No more no less) 
(Do the shang-a-lang) 
(No more no less) 
(No one on the subway ever chats to me) 
(No more no less) 
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(Three feet high and rising) 
(No more no less) 
(Three)

Rose Parade,Elliott Smith,"They asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
Traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
'Cos he's fucking up even the simplest lines
They say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the streets I'll be the only shit that's left behind

Rainbowarriors,CocoRosie,"Of all the white horses

In these times of evil spirits
Of material thugs and mischief
Fearing Saint Noni's wisdom
And his love for rainbow spirits
Jealous of their faithful heart-bond
And their dancing and their laughing
Made at last a league against them
To molest them and destroy them
Saint Noni wise and heart-strong
Often said to Rainbowarrior
""O my brother, do not leave me!
Lest the evil spirits harm you!""
Rainbowarrior of two spirits
Gentle hand and lion-hearted
He laughed and then he answered
Like a child he softly whispered:

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears

He's dead, our sweetest mother
Loving father and our teacher
He's gone forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the master of all laughter
To the master of all song
O my brother, O my brother
Crystal brother of two spirits
Then we gathered in a circle
Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning ember's hearts united
We remember mystical beauty
If you look hard you can find a
Rainbow trail it's deep inside ya
Fear not you're a Rainbowarrior
Golden light on everything gleaming

We are Rainbowarriors

Rainbow love awaits us

Charmed Life,The Divine Comedy,"When I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life
My charmed life
I hope, I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life
A charmed life

Well, I never really worried that much
About making lots of money and such
And I always seemed to land upon my feet
And though there's been some difficult times
The good times were never far behind
I snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat

When I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life
My charmed life
I hope, dear
Baby, I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life
A charmed life

Well, the course of true love never ran smooth
They broke my heart, and I broke theirs, too
And breaking up was so very hard to do
But I knew I'd find the one
And sure enough, she came along
And not long after that, along came you

Well, sometimes this life is like being afloat
On a raging sea in a little rowboat
Just trying not to be washed overboard
But if you take your chances and you ride your luck
And you never, never, never, never, never give up
Well, those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore

When I hold you in my arms
I know that this is a charmed life

The Trapeze Swinger,Iron & Wine,"Please remember me, happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

a heart of gold, that likened him to
all the stories he told
of past battles, won and lost, and
legends of old a seasoned veteran in
his own time

on the battlefield, he gained
respectful fame with many medals
of bravery and stripes to his name
he grew a beard as soon as he could
to cover the scars on his face
and always urged his men on

but on the eve of a great battle
with the infantry in dream
the old general tossed in his sleep
and wrestled with its meaning
he awoke from the night
just to tell what he had seen
and walked slowly out of his tent

all the men held tall with their
chests in the air, with courage in
their blood and a fire in their stare
it was a grey morning and they all
wondered how they would fare
till the old general told them to go home

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

but the men stood fast with their
guns on their shoulders not knowing
what to do with the contradicting orders
the general said he would do his own
duty but would extend it no further
the men could go as they pleased

but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
till one by one
they stepped back and not a word was said
and the old general was left with his
own words echoing in his head
he then prepared to fight

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting, no
and I've seen their mothers

Crazy Love,Van Morrison,"I can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache in the night like a thief

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need her in the daytime
I need her
Yes I need her in the night
I need her
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
I need her
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me whole
Yes it makes me mellow down into my soul

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Life Is Sweet,Natalie Merchant,"It's a pity
It's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again? 
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside 

It's a pity
It's a downright crime
But it happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
Wanna hide from the vicious world outside 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

Your daddy he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied, 
And you know
That's not right 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 
It's high time that you decide
In your own mind 

Tried to comfort you
Tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind
They can't see 

Fortune gonna come some day
All gonna fade away
Your daddy the war machine and
Your mama the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she can not see 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 

It's high time you decide
It's time you make up your own sweet little mind 

They told you life is long
Be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more
You should be grateful 

But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know
It will be over 

Cause life is sweet
And life is also very short
Your life is sweet",1998,happy
No Other Way,Jack Johnson,"When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break

All the words that we said
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake
Now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep,
It's all that we need
When we wake we would find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

I would not hold them from...

You imagine songs that have never been played.

And the truth is a bitter friend.
But reasons few have I to go back again.

Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day.
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain.
There's no path to follow, once you're here.
You'll climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs.

Came without warning

But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way

Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again

Has turned to Sunday's rain

Deeper than a secret

My hand my hand
Magic on the one

Too late to wonder how

Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks

a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul,

that you can do

he's a ghost, he's a guru

through this disappearing land

is a red right hand

He'll get you some
You don't have no car? 
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,

Doing the things a particle can

Or does the water get him instead?

Usually kind to smaller man

Millenium hand and an eon hand
When they meet it's a happy land

Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can

Does he feel totally worthless?

Waltz (Better Than Fine),Fiona Apple,"If you don't have a song
To sing you're okay
You know how to get along

Hmmm

If you don't have a date
Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do
Nobody does it anymore

No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine

If you don't have a point to make
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine",2005,happy

One Four Five,The Cat Empire,"Listen doctor I have pain

Ah pollution fills my lungs 
And convolution fills my mind 
Ah my legs do ache 
I contemplate 
That living's less than fine 
My spine does tingle

Freed from this curse

Life is a bubble 
Blown until it's burst

To get rid of this feeling 
Oh doctor I am desperate

Got a record with a tag 
That said listen to this daily 
With hip shaking and such things 
Then he puts the record on 
Grabs a mic and starts to sing

One four five

To make you high to make you high 
When heaven falling from the sky 
To make you high to make you high 

Doctor I am feeling better 
What was that you sang 
Did you write it or recite it 
Or just steal it from a band 
Ah my bones are feeling stronger 
And my spirit's feeling fresh 
Ah that dose of 145 has put the life 
Back in my breath 
'yes yes yes' the doctor said 
Then he sat me down and say 
'young man don't think I wrote 
These chords they're written in 
Your brain' 
And when you hear them 
There's a shakedown that begins within 
The mind 
Cos these three chords make people 
Feeling better all the time ah 
They keep repeating 
Like a scratch on a cd 
But it's quality cos these three harmonies 
Breed positivity 
Protecting against insanity 
Of modern insecurities 
Believe me when I tell you 
All you need is to be hearing all that

To make you high to make you high

The Mariner's Revenge Song,The Decemberists,"We are two mariners
Our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs are ceiling beams
Its guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you
And I will relay to you
How our histories interweave

At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease

As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind

Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried,
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat

But never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty

The following day
I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind
I could almost hear
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea:
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed.""

And then, that fateful night,
We had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath

The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale
(oh, oh)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive as well as me

It gives my heart great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(oh, oh)",2005,happy

Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop

Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found

To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore

Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia

Black Friday Rule,Flogging Molly,"I want to believe in myself once again 
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end 
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you 
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye 
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy 
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold 
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane 
Flew all the way to California 
This mess in my head is a mess getting out 
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry 
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine 
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed 
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still 
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill 
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe 
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

So I must remain in my new adopted land 
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can 
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name 
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""

And when you come back home,

And you never made your wife moan,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan.""

And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead""

Salty Dog,Flogging Molly,"I'll wait for you till I turn blue 
There's nothin' more a man can do 
Don't get your bollocks in a twist 
Settle down, don't take a fit 
Ya drank with demons straight form Hell 
They almost nearly won as well 
Ya wiped the floor with victory 
Then puked until you fell asleep

Blackened was the banshee's wail 
These boot will never fill her jail 
So you crawled into an empty boat 
For the Gulf of Mexico 
Till Cortez came an' when so did you 
From the ashes charred and blue 
Smellin' like a Salty Dog 
Back from Hell where you belong

Anarchy, the scourge of every sea 
The Antichrist aboard a rig 
With us your cutthroat thieves 
The ship went down we all near drowned 
Ya stood there on the deck 
Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse 
And dragged you from the wreck

They threw a rope around yer neck 
To watch you dance the jig of death 
Then left ya for the starvin' crows 
Hoverin' like hungry whores 
One flew down plucked out yer eye 
The other he had in his sights 
Ya snarled at him, said leave me be 
I need the bugger so I can see",2000,happy

Life on Mars?,David Bowie,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Drifting into my solitude,

But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
And she's down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian, child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight!""

Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothers and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustling, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them

Song for Myla Goldberg,The Decemberists,"Myla Goldberg sets a steady hand upon her brow 
Myla Goldberg hangs a crooked foot all upside down 

It comes around it comes around 
It comes around it comes around 

Pretty hands do pretty things when pretty times arise 
Seraphim and seaweed swim where stick-limbed Myla lies 

It comes around it comes around 
It comes around it comes around 

Still now you're waiting to grow 
Inside you're old 
Sew wings to your pigeon toes 
Put paper to pen 
to spell out ""Eliza"" 

We begin with sticky shins make sticky then our shoes 
Shoes beget to clothes and hat 'til sticky's sticking too 

Finiculi finicula finiculi finicula 

Listen in as shin-kicked Jim relates his story sad 
About a boy who kicked until his shins were all but rubberbands 
But now 

I know New York I need New York 
I know I need unique New York 

Still now you're waiting to grow 
Inside you're old 
Sew wings to your pigeon toes 
Put paper to pen

Red Right Ankle,The Decemberists,"This is the story of your red right ankle 
And how it came to meet your leg 
And how the muscle bone and sinews tangled 
And how the skin was softly shed 
And how it whispered, 
""Oh, adhere to me for we are bound by symmetry 
And whatever differences our lives have been 
We together make a limb"" 
This is the story of your red right ankle 

This is the story of your gypsy uncle 
You never knew cause he was dead 
And how his face was carved an ripped with wrinkles 
In the picture in your head 
And remember how you found the key 
To his hide-out in the Pyrenees, 
But you wanted to keep his secret safe, 
So you threw the key away? 
This is the story of your gypsy uncle 

This is the story of the boys who loved you 
Who love you now and loved you then 
And some were sweet and some were cold and snuffed you 
And some just layed around in bed 
And some, they crumbled you straight to your knees 
Did it cruel, did it tenderly 
Some they crawled their way into your heart 
To rend your ventricles apart 
This is the story of the boys who loved you 
This is the story of your red right ankle",2003,happy

I swore to no compromise
'Til I felt my caress on your skin

And your father came all unhinged

With your blood still warm on the ground

Of your brother calling me out
And you ran like a fool to my side

Well, the shot, it hit hard
And your frame went limp in my arms
And an oath of love was your dying cry

Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect,The Decemberists,"And here I dreamt I was a soldier
And I marched the streets of Burkenau
And I recall in spring
The perfume that the air would bring
To the indolent town
Where the barkers call the moon down
The carnival was ringing loudly now
And just to lay with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And I am nothing of a builder
But here I dreamt I was an architect
And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world
But the angles and the corners
Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And here in Spain I am a Spaniard
I will be buried with my marionettes
Countess and courtesan
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
While you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seat belts on
We live this close to death

And try one, and try two

A Cautionary Song,The Decemberists,"There's a place your mother goes
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoats
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach

With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle
And she's laid in bed on the upper deck

And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Til at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions, and their opinions

And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her thirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed, and this is how you're fed

So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep",2002,happy
The Legionnaire's Lament,The Decemberists,"I'm a legionnaire
Camel in disrepair
Hoping for a Frigidaire to come passing by
I am on reprieve
Lacking my joie de vivre
Missing my gay Paree
In this desert dry

And I wrote my girl
Told her I would not return
I've terribly taken a turn
For the worse now, I fear

It's been a year or more
Since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war
So far away from my home

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again

La la la la dam
La la la low

Medicating in the sun
Pinch doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage!
A bottle of ancient Chiraz!
The smattering of distant applause
Is ringing in my poor ears

On the old left bank
My baby in a charabanc
Riding up the width and length
Of the Champs Elysee

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)

With disappearing clouds, the sun arrives

I will fight; will fight with understanding.

Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A straight line exists between me and the good things.
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.

I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.",1978,happy

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me

The Whole of the Moon,The Waterboys,"I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
But you saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed and I tried
You just knew
I sighed
But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers, and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

Yes, you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon",1985,happy

To steal what she never could own
And race from this hole she calls home

Now you're at the wheel
Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails
And fills up her brigantine sails

She'll carry on through it all

Your brother is a blister
I'll be had if I'm in your dress tonight

When you go and you're all alone
Are you still afraid of home
Do you lie in bed with fright

Your father said I lost her
Your brother said I fought her
But I stood still and I'm in your arms tonight

And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say good lies
And know that I will be your bail bond

Said hey there hey mister
My cold razor's edge will meet you in the light

When you go and you're on stage
Is your heart still filled with rage?
Do you still fight for lover's rights?

Challenge is for lovers
But I run my feet hurt
So I'll stay here and fight for lover's rights

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger

Just hug my lips and say good lies

Kelly don't you go
Kelly don't you go
I want you to know
That I've been trying, I've been lying
I've been stealing, I've been hiding
I will meet you in the grave
Kelly, Kelly, it's not your right
To be cheating, fighting and starting life
When my head and hands are tied to you so tight
Oh Kelly just tell me one more thing
Is it mine or is it some other ring
That you wear as we lie in bed tonight?

And Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh, Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh Kelly, who's the logger who's trees were felled with might?
And Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, Kelly, hold your water tight

Our golden handshake has been smashed into this shape.
It's taken magic to a primitive new place
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set
It looked as if I picked your name out of a hat
Next thing you know you are asleep in someone's lap
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

We quit the room
Quit so our thoughts could rest
Rest them, I'll never move?

Of whatever it is we fell into

In business of your lives

Forehead is leaking, my AC squeaks
And a voice from the clock says, ""You're not gonna get tired""
My bed is a pool and the walls are on fire
Soak my head in the sink for a while
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you, we're going.

(I'm not sure where...
I'm not sure where, but I have seen you today)

It doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze, get a midnight meal
I point in the windows, you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard, smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go when our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yarn you'll be sleeping soon
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down, we'll go out again.

Don't cool off, I like your warmth.

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it whets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls, says that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace
And I want to walk around with you

Change the locks,
Change the scene
Change it all but can't change what we've been

Tough iron filings, diamonds cut
Bright steely shining

Came on their wings, I threw them away

Train Under Water,Bright Eyes,"You were born inside of a raindrop

She'd fallen down too, now the streets are wet

Body of water
Toxic and timeless

When I leave the village
So I couldn't come meet you 
In Brooklyn last night

But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace to the people I meet

That instant of life
That wipes the slate clean

So don't be fooled
No don't get lied to
Love was always cruel

And don't act strange
Don't be a stranger
It happened to me, now it's happening to you

But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through

Well if I could tame
All of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The winds indecision 
The sorrowful rain

Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind

And now I'm riding
All over this island
Looking for something 
To open my eyes

But I still sing glory from my high rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time, when we'll be set free

So don't stay mad
Just let some time pass

Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Calling You,Blue October,"There's something that I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I've said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

Well expect me to be
Calling you to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

[Chorus:]
I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
It's so hard sometimes
Then I fell in love with you
Then came you
And you took that away
It's not so difficult
The world is not so difficult
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you

I only want to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,"When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

Drive to the ocean and stare up at the stars

Automatic guns
Death in large numbers
And no respect for women or our little ones

Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And he could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
When you've given up the drink
And those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early, at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up, I watch it as it sets
Yeah, this is as good as it gets

Awake,Electric Guest,"Back to sin again, must be fate
The wait was all day
Black acts to amend at the gate
Awaiting to taste

Something perished past and gone away
And nothing ever lasts that hesitates

Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Back from holiday in my head
The ocean calling
Magic in the grave at the end
The old way falling

Something calling asking to create
The only other lasting love to make

Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Cause there's something within
There is something within, I'm awake
All my friends
There's something between
Because something within, I'm awake
You're all my friends
Alone, enough, awake [repeat]

Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way
Love is our only true escape
Fearing nothing washed away the weight away the weight

Positively 4th Street,Bob Dylan,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down you just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on the side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you? Good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand it's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is to see you",,happy
Three Hours,Nick Drake,"Three hours from sundown

In search of a slave

Jacomo's free
Taking his woes 
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known

Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder

Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show

Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by

Why you never wondered why
Safe in a womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light

Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know 
What you are really worth

The frost in a broken tree.

Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies.

Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never.

The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more

Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

How could she do this to me?""

I pulled away
cuz you see I didn't think it would be
right I said let's save this
for some other night
She said ""No, no, no I know
That everything is gonna be just fine""
How could I do this when I want her to be all mine.

Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.

Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.

Is it hard to believe

Can you sign up and leave.

Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine

Look we have similar frowns

It points to the West and leaves out the rest
And invites you to be his special guest

Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again

Barrowland Ballroom,Amy Macdonald,"Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone.
Oh the girls in the Queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung.

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
through the Barrowland history
and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care it's
it's only me and you.
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
it's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you.
That people they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care
tonight, it's only me and you.

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band starts to play.
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

And when the night turns to day
And the lights they fade away
I wish that life and love would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear.
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age.

I Don't Wanna Grow Up,Tom Waits,"When I'm lyin' in my bed at night

Makes me wish that I could be a dog

I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan

And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one

Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion

Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames
Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up
In your own domain
Fire crackers ohh and aah
But they never maintain

Flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides on an alter made from the ground

Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on to Mount Zion

One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries but the other one sings
You walk around like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got, thank God for all that life brings
The poor man has it all but not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty but he's sitting like a king

Backpack's getting heavy, moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders and lead around your waist

Oh yeah!
Its the music that we choose [x4]

I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a mild groove on

Day do, dah bop [x4]

There you go!
Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine! [x4]

Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail

And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose

Mama,Spice Girls,"She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be

Chemo Limo,Regina Spektor,"I had a dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said if you don't want to do it
then you don't have to do it
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then in my dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway

My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company

Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in

The doctor he asked which way we were headed
I said, Sir, let's just go west and he listened obediently,
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC

Plenty of Paper,Eisley,"Something's growing under that wing
I think a face is dawning
Oh no the books are growing faces
And you're lost quite classically
With your nose in a book
And it seems so fitting
And perhaps this is the end we've sought after for so long
And perhaps now it's done

Cause we've found all the dire dreams of men and machines
And turned them all around our identical hands
Composing our commands
I cut the moon in half
And stuck a piece to my hair
It made the back of my head glow
Golden yellow and then I took
Ten stars on sticks and placed them in my small metal
Bucket and I gave the other half of the moon to you
Ooh, so you wouldn't forget me while I'm gone

Cause we found all the dire dreams of men and machines and
Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves
Our paperback books, our charming looks
Our identical hands
Composing our commands
And oh my love
We can live on the sun
And wouldn't we be attractive
Riding in our shiny motor cars
With eyeglasses full of stars
And plenty of paper for scenery paintings

Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves

Our identical hands

Hates her music 
Hates all of her clothes
Thinks of surgery
And a new nose
Every calorie is a war
While she wishes she 
Was a dancer
And that she'd never 
Heard of cancer
She wishes God would give her
Some answers
And make her feel beautiful

For all the, huh, lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do.

I read your letter
The one you left when you broke into my house
Retracing every step you made
And you said you meant it
And there's a piece of me in every single
Second of every single day
But if it's true then tell me how it got this way

Brought it to my house, where you lay

I headed downtown, to share what I had found
It's not a suicide, it's a crime

There had to be someone else present
At the time of death, poisons in stomach
How could she pull it, if she's dead?

Creatures (For a While),311,"My name is volatile
I've been this way a long while
I'd surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It's been a wild ride
I wouldn't change a minute
I can't slow down inside
Guess that's why I live it

The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth's hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown

I'm not used to it, you'd think I'd be by now
The ins the outs the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you we're gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You're lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display

It's something one won't understand
Unless they're in it with me hand and hand

Don't buy the fear don't buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn
Even if you're coming down

Sometimes it's wearable sometimes is bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is full

I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire

Which is times'd by the daggers and the root of all our fights,
The pass of your poem just to swathe me in your knowing

Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I am a dash and you are a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote

I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over-analysed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am ""Needing of your love""

I want to find you tear out all your tenderness

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters

Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters

May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

Her dreams went out the door
When she turned twenty four
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become T.V.
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows

Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities 
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

What's always in the way?
Why so damn absent-minded?
Why so scared of romance?

Because the blinds were shut
Sha sha sha shut so tight

I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear

She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town

Seventeen without a purpose or direction

Just to keep you around

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no Internet
But, man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

The Zephyr Song,Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on?
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no not today

Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up itâs on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickinâ up but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
Weâll find a place together
Fly on my wind

Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

Scar,Missy Higgins,"He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said ""use these down to your bones""
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought ""this one knows better than I do""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, she smelled like sugar and
Spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one, looked at my insides clicking
Her tongue and said
""This will all have to come undone""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?

Could you leave me with a scar?
Ohh, could you leave me with a scar?

Just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy
Just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky
And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize
That everyday he finds
Just what he's looking for
Like a shooting star he shines

He said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Did he ask if I would come along
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

Set Yourself on Fire,Stars,"In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing [x6]
There is only one... thing

Do You Believe In Magic?,The Lovin' Spoonful,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

Minus the tights and the fairies

Perfectly at peace

She said, ""Fine,""
And in thirty seconds time
She said,

""I want to live like common people.
I want to do whatever common people do,
I want to sleep with common people

Well, what else could I do?

I don't know why but I had to start it
Somewhere,
So it started there.

Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here.""

Cut your hair and get a job. 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school. 

But still you'll never get it right 
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching 'roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all.

You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
And dance and drink and screw 
Because there's nothing else to do. 

Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do. 
Because you think that poor is cool.

Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Landed,Ben Folds,"We'd hit the bottom,
I thought it was my fault
And in a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about

Moved to the west coast away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still, I was still in love

Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up...I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
Until I believed I was the crazy one, 
and in a way
I guess I was...

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading a sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

If you wrote me off I'd understand it
Because I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up...
I've landed

And you will be so
happy to know
I've come alone,
it's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's by my goodbye I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's OK to call
Now I'll answer for myself

Come pick me up,
...I've landed",2005,happy

Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us
and we knew it was time to take a chance here
and time to compromise our lives just a little while
and it was time for all the wrong reasons
but time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun
to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines
then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
and they knew it was time, time to take a chance here
time to compromise our little lives just a little while

I'm on the right track, yeah I'm on to a winner.

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic

And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault it's how I'm programmed to function

Summer of '69,Bryan Adams,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard.
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you've got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah.
Back in the summer of '69, oh.

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no! yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever

My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

And I fell in love with everyone I saw

I know
And I'm my only enemy
Pain is all that I can see oh

I see you're climbing a tree
And I know
That it's easier to be up high in
The air than oh the ground
And it's love, etc.

You say you can't say anymore
You've already said it before
In a million different ways which
Were all not quite right
The rain is loud on the ground
Well I know
But I don't even make a sound when
I come around oh
And you say I'd be better off dead
This I know
But it's no use hiding this pretty
Head in the ground
And it's love, etc.

We can do the broken fist
We can tear down all the borders
Or abbreviate the list
And when finally the finish line
Emerges from the mist we'll sound
A soft alarm",2005,happy

Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you

Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst

You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

Make it a nice place

Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw

Why can't I sleep at night,
Don't say it's gonna be alright,

And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
But eventually the sky did return and I was there outside in green
I watched the world being reborn until one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know it was beautiful slow dancing
To tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love just like blood will always stain
And if I could reverse it I don't think it would be worth it

Time just rolls on and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold tight to your dream

[CHORUS:]
When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over & over & over you could

Accroches-toi a ton reve
Accroches-toi a ton reve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sents -- ton coeur se briser
Accroches-toi a ton reve.

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream.

Oh, yeah
Hold on tight to your dream
Yeah, hold on tight...

Don't Get Me Wrong,The Pretenders,"Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in awhile
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the 'mode of passion'
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong",1986,happy

You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end

there goes the heartbreak that I can live without 
I've been so frustrated, bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted all the things I've got
But now that you are here this anger disappears
and I feel happy too this is sappy but it's true

The Bird and The Worm,Owl City,"If you're the bird

I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)

And feel the shine

And cast a line

I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends

As they arrive

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well,
Who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears

If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make
Each other blush
(you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well,
Who needs anemones?

And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

The Saltwater Room,Owl City,"I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

The Rhythm,The Cat Empire,"And for all of the sweet loving that
I have received

One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your soul?'

When you're walking along:

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile

'why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'

And she'll show you some rhythm

And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away

And when this tune is through

And continue to:

Pink slips and white wall tires
Bet you twenty I'll beat you there
Down on the county line

It's first love and football wars
A French kiss and battle cries
Further then I've been before
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

All the church yards and whitewash fences
All the widows and teenage brides
We're all searching for redemption
We're all looking for a sign

Down on the county line (down on the county line)
Down on the county line (down on the county line)

The best things in life are free
It's been right here all the time
It's everything that's home to me
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Eye Know,De La Soul,"[POS:]
Greetings, girl, and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[DOVE:]
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[POS:]
Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

(Eye know I love you better)

[DOVE:]
It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee,
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two,
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

To be brilliant or superior

In defeat than in the brightest victory

Late in the Evening,Paul Simon,"The first thing I remember
I was lying In my bed
I couldn't of been no more
Than one or two
I remember there's a radio
Comin' from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do
When it's late in the evening
And the music s seeping through

The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shootin pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage In this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
myself a ""J""
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began
to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away
The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you
And it was late in the evening

Higher now than ever before 
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy

On the back of a hurricane

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live

Never had to speak

And threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious
But it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby
In patterns and flowers

And she went into her bedroom
And she sat on her bed

If I wanna think, I'll think in my head""

And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age

Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my man in Houston Texas 
Just before he finished breakfast 
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 

Hell if Jesus had the power than so do I 
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
If music is the victim then so am I",2004,happy
Girl All the Bad Guys Want,Bowling for Soup,"8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin' 
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me. 
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring, 
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means. 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She doesn't notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange 
Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad 
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty 
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She'll never notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

She likes 'em with a mustache 
Racetrack season pass 
Drivin' in a Trans-Am 
Does a mullet make a man? 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

There she goes again 
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair 
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated 
All I wanted was to see her naked! 

Now I am watchin' wrestling 
Tryin' to be a tough guy 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in my eyes 
I can't grow a mustache 
And I ain't got no season pass 
All I got's a moped...moped....moped..... 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 

She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
(There she goes again) 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want!

The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?

And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.

'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.

And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.

And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
Cause when I'm here I'm always something.

This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.

By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?

Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap

If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free

With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead

Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter

With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

Move outta' the way man, dom-dee

Cowgirl king of the rodeo let the good times roll,

Have to let them be

Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day, 'cause they are

Know Your Onion!,The Shins,"Shut out, pimpled and angry.
I quietly tied all my guts into knots.
Gave up on trying to make them,
I figured it'd take them too long to look up and besides...

It was undeniably clear to me i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew what worthless dregs we've always been.

Lucked out and found my favorite records
Lying in wait at the birmingham mall.
The songs that i heard,
The occasional book
Were the only fun i ever took.
And i got on with making myself.
The trick is just making yourself.

But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight...

Three thousand miles north east
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads.
""what kind of life you dream of? you're allergic to love.""
Yes i know but i must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me, i don't know why

The selfless, loving saints we are,
The melting, sliding dice we've always been.",2001,happy

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.

Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site.

With the furies breathing down your neck.

Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug?

Huh, your drug?

While his father pulls the maid,

While discussing foreign trade,

And he hopes to grab his father's loot,
When Pater passes on.

While my soul keeps singing the blues

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Dance like a spinning top

Or maybe it's just my hay fever 
The weeds are green, the sky is shining 
But it'll soon be night which is nicer 
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room 
And the devil gestures to you 
You've never seen such a Beelzebee 
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening 
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out 
What do you make of this doubt?

But hell for the company

It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet 
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreat 
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin 
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin 
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars 
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating - 
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven

You tell the devil in no uncertain terms 
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned 
What is this evil? And who decides this? 
When left to devices some humans try shit 
This is the reason we should all be tied up? 
We're just normal people exploring our minds 
We don't go around here putting poison in wine 
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right 
People are intricate, people aren't swines 
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds 
Sign on the line

Rainbows in the Dark,Tilly and the Wall,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naÃ¯ve son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
We finally had front-page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the colour's so vibrant , the colour's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river

or your enemies will see you naked

I found you a home
4 million in prizes
you left me alone

I found some poison in your bed

Why can't we be making love nice and easy,
It's time to spread our wings and fly,
Don't let another day go by my love,

Why don't we take off alone,
Take a trip somewhere far, far away,
We'll be together all alone again,

Song Against Sex,Neutral Milk Hotel,"And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, ""Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string""
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream - 
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind 
So I'm always sober
Always aching 
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you...
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving - 
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.",1996,happy

Work it while you're on top, call the cops

Rollercoaster riding, baby
Up and down
I love to watch you do it

I just want to get close to you
Find out what it takes to move you

Feel the rhythm, hit the spot, getting hot
All night long

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

Keep in mind, I'm a love machine
Get it twenty four seven, call me any time you need

Some extra attention, did I forget to mention
School's back in session, get ready for a lesson

I just want to feel alive
And do what it takes to satisfy you

Hour after hour baby
All night long with you

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

Ugly,Sugababes,"When I was 7
They said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was OK
They said you're more beautiful
And that's the way they show that they wish
That they had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous cos

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
Cos I didn't know my body would change
I grew taller than them in more ways
But there will always be the one who will say
Something bad to make them feel great

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do

And never realises how it affects somebody

Envy is the only thing it could be

First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005,happy
Saint Simon,The Shins,"After all these implements and text designed by intellects
So vexed to find evidently there's just so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night

Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside

There's no measuring of it
As nothing else is love

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing really holds a candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you",2003,happy
Soul Meets Body,Death Cab for Cutie,"I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel, feel what its like to be new

Cause in my head thereâs a greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
where theyâre far more suited than here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one anotherâs
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe itâs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause youâre the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

And I do believe itâs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too

While we strive to figure out a way we can survive
These trying times without losing our minds

And if you wanna cut yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
And if you wanna kill yourself remember that I LOVE YOU

Send me an IM, I'll be your friend

Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation
And I'll say FUCK BUSH AND FUCK THIS WAR
My war paint is sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
They think we're disposable, well both my thumbs opposable
Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score

Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame

This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation

I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?
If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now

Wonderful World,James Morrison,"I've been down so low
People look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong

Staring through a window
Standing outside, they're just too happy to care tonight
I want to be like them
But I'll mess it up again

I tripped on my way in
And got kicked outside, everybody saw...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love
It just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything
I'd never, never, ever let you feel alone
I won't I won't leave you, on your own

But who am I to dream?
Dreams are for fools, they let you down...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me, or maybe just a little letter
Oh, we could start again

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I know that it's a wonderful world
I can't feel it right now
I got all the right clothes to wear
I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Smiley Faces,Gnarls Barkley,"[Verse]
What did you do? What did you say?
Did you walk - or did you run away?
Where are you now? Where have you been?
Did you go alone - or did you bring a friend?

[Hook #1]
I need to know this - cause I notice when you're smilin'
Out in the sun havin' fun and you're feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me

[Verse]
What went right? What went wrong?
Was it the story - or was it the song?
Was it overnight - or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

[Hook #2]
Or all the above - oh how I love to see you smilin'
And oh yeah - take a little pain just in case
You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smilin' face
Hey, put on a smilin' face

[Bridge]
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

[Hook #3]
I want to be you - whenever I see you smilin'
Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face",2006,happy
Have a Nice Day,Stereophonics,"San Francisco Bay
Past pier thirty nine
Early p.m.
Can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab
Stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of
But it turned out just right

It started straight off
""Coming here is hell""
That's his first words
We asked what he meant
He said "" where ya' from?""
We told him our lot
""When ya' take a holiday
Is this what you want?""

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day
Have a drink to chase
""Yourself and tourists, yeah
That's what I hate""
He said ""We're going wrong
We've all become the same
We dress the same ways
Only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

I drive around all day
And kill processed fish

It seemed like rainbows would appear 
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear 
Because you looked just like a girl 
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast

And you're all working in a submarine""

She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance

Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eye,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say.
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends.

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoyin'
And say something like
""Yeah, intelligent input darlin'. Why don't you just have another beer then?""

Then you'll call me a ""bitch"" and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit.

The cracks in our foundation,

I said, ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate,

And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up.

'Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
'Cause it's making me sick.

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these yesterday.
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this.

Well I'll leave you there 'til the mornin',
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one.

The cracks in our foundation,

Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard,Paul Simon,"The mama pajama rolled out of bed

What mama saw
It was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, ""Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna put him in the house of detention""

Do You Remember,Jack Johnson,"Do you remember when we first met? I sure do.
It was some time in early September
But you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find â you painted flowers on it
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon.

Well, I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all,
Over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine,
We're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You'd play me boogie woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are.

We built our get away up in a tree we found.
We felt so far away, but we were still in town.
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at.

Well, all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind,
We're locked in time
But you're still mine

Sir Duke,Stevie Wonder,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

Don't make it in the groove

When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out

That is circling all round the sun

In a blink of an eye and be gone from me

Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Oh how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place

Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice

My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut

Which connection I should cut

And your heart is finally mending

It's not too late now to change your mind
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line

An attic in a basement
Attic in a basement

And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that it feels like it is ending
It shouldn't feel like it is ending",2003,happy
I'm Like a Bird,Nelly Furtado,"You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is 
(and baby all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

[Chorus]

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
Each and every single day I know 
I'm going to have to eventually give you away
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey I'm just scared
That we may fall through

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.,Noah and the Whale,"Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes
That've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Loney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone

From the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said:

[Chorus]
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home

Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

From the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say:

[Chorus]
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way

What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way

On my last night on earth, I want to look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

Tire Swing,Kimya Dawson,"I took the Polaroid down in my room.
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend.
It's not as if I don't like you.
It just makes me sad whenever I see it.

'Cause I like to be gone most of the time,
And you like to be home most of the time.
If I stay in one place I lose my mind.
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride,
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason.
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan.
Paul Baribeau took me to the giant tire swing,
Gave me a push and he started singing.
I sang along while I was swinging.
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

Now I'm home for less than 24 hours.
That's hardly time to take a shower.
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall.
Check my e-mail, write a song and make a few phone calls.

Before it's time to leave again
I got one hand on the steering wheel, one waving out the window.
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My yarns will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.

Fighting in a Sack,The Shins,"Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
And had it nailed to my forehead again 
To keep this boat afloat 
There are things you can't afford to know 
So I save all my breath for the sails. 

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Walking a bridge with weakening cables 
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through. 

Most ideas turn to dust 
As there are few in which we all can trust 
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mind? 
So let's abandon that track 
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack 
Cause we are way too wise-assed for that. 

You might find some fools at your doorstep 
Hustling the latest changes to the book 
That's the strangest in an attempt to multiply 
Marionettes on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate 
Because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through. 

We've taken on a climb 
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs 
Walking up a slide 
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track.

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Crossing the brindge on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through",2003,happy

Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?

Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cuz I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)

You whisper half thoughts to me

And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

Sultans of Swing,Dire Straits,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south London town

You check out guitar, George
He knows all the chords
Mind it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band
It ain't what they call ""Rock 'n' Roll""
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole, Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home.""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing,
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing.""",1978,happy

The Sound of Settling,Death Cab for Cutie,"I've got a hunger
Twisting my stomach into knots
That my tongue was tied off

My brain's repeating
""if you've got an impulse let it out""

Baa bah, baa bah

Our youth is fleeting
Old age is just around the bend
And i can't wait to go grey

And i'll sit and wonder
Of every love that could've been
If i'd only thought of something charming to say.

Little Secrets,Passion Pit,"When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
(higher, higher, higher, higher...)

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colours of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)

Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)

And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
It's late and the sun keeps shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up

Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there

The covers pulled up over your head
Am i asleep or awake?
It's morning and the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am i asleep or awake?

From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

Billy Liar,The Decemberists,"Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
Staring over at the neighbor's, knickers down.
He's got his knickers down.

So the summer is eternity for you?
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
He's shaking you down.

And the mailroom shift gets a real short shrift
As you dole out the packages, no-one seems to want you around
All skulking around.

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.

All a-drifting, he's a no-good boyo
Sent a-fishing for a whalebone corset frame
(His only catch all day)

So he sits and lets the current take him
A gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray
And at his ankles laid.

As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!

At Least I'm Not as Sad (as I Used to Be),fun.,"Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

Câmon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, at least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, itâs been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You shouldâve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

Câmon can you count all the loves that didnât last?
Itâs such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said we wouldâve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youthâs taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing....

So I left, that is it. Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât keep friends, I keep acquainted,
Iâm not a prophet, but Iâm here to profit.

Thatâs all, Iâm gone! Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.

And find out where she got her wings

States that keep us far apart
Track the beating of my heart
Mark the places in my book
With photographs we never took
I swear that I'm not kidding
The night time is so pretty
With all the stars above your eyes
I'm sneaking out and making ties

Mark the rhythms that I shook
Everytime I caught you look

Could work the poor, though I'm hungry for fame

Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat
Aren't things more easy, with a tight six pack
Who knows the answers, who do you trust
I can't even separate love from lust
Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans
Working nine to five, answering phones
But don't make me live for Friday nights
Drinking eight pints and getting in fights
Maybe I'll just fall in love
That could solve it all
Philosophers say that that's enough
There surely must be more
Love ain't the answer, nor is work

Do It Again,The Beach Boys,"It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go

Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again

With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight

Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)

All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again

Carried Away,Passion Pit,"Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold in
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper, my money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend

Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene

Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

All your appeal
Once again we'd feel it
Higher education making sense

Justify your thesis
Certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defence

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can

Let's agree there's no need
No more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends

Carried away from you

Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to

Won't you have something to say about it

We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say

Captains and Cruise Ships,Owl City,"I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you",P:  ,happy

But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

See the lights of a neighbor's house

Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was) and she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
Drifting this way and that
Not touching ground at all
Up above the yard

She was glad about it... no doubt about it
She isn't sure where she's gone
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

How we don't have a song""

After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed

All the roses

Waited for something to come along

Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

The World at Large,Modest Mouse,"Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth.

They're like,
""Alright""
What ya saying,
""Yeah can I take your digits?""
And you're like, ""no not in a million years, you're nasty
please leave me alone.""

Cut to the pub on our last night out,
Man at the bar cos it was his shout,
Clocks this bird and she looks OK,
Caught him looking and she walks his way,
""Alright darling, you gonna buy us a drink then?""
""Err no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend...""

She's got no taste hand on his waist, tries to pull away but her lips on his face,
""If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer""
""Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture.""

[Chorus]
Can't knock em out, can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you can't have my number,
""Why?""
Because I've lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant, having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah...

""I recognize this guy's way of thinking...""
As he comes over her face starts sinking,
She's like,
""Oh here we go..""
It's a routine check that she already knows, she's thinking: ""They're all the same.""

""Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?""
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag, tries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light,
""Here use mine""
""You see the thing is I just don't have the time.""

Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling down, type of tears that money couldn't buy

But I only work here to pay my tuition

Table-top pleaser
Give me what I need a Mastercard a Visa

Picture us on an all white canopy

Like Billy D. said he's feeling me
Take me away from here, so far
Where they ride horses, no cars
No more stripping in bars
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds

fronting like the Budweiser commercial
Talking about, 'I, I don't be going to the strip joints'
You're lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.
I got one question for you liars, man)

Shot callers, what are you, a preacher?

And told me if I ever have problems,
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so

And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard 'til they sparked

Rid me of the problem, do all that you can,

Banquet,Bloc Party,"A heart of stone, a smoking gun

A heart of stone, a smoking gun

Why'd you feel so negated?

Becoming adult
Turning into myself

To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
No, no, no she don't think straight

She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

My British Tour Diary,of Montreal,"On our trip to England I noticed something obscene
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
and Brighton's lovely in the Fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
Paul and Sorrel too
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley

Performing with the Apples
and then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
because we hadn't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station

Up to our necks in crisps and litter
in the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter",2004,happy

Without You,Harry Nilsson,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something

I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,
Possessed  by a fury that burns from inside.

Cry like a child, though these years make me older,
With children my time is so wastefully spent,
A burden to keep, though their inner communion,
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden,
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,
No words could explain, no actions determine,
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.",1980,sad

Stepping outside she is free

Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)

Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

Something inside that was always denied

Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away

A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt",2001,sad
Through Glass,Stone Sour,"I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, god it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

[This verse is on the album version only:]
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope

So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins
Contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart
It never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
(Null and void instead of voices)

Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

And it's the stars
The stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah
[x2 - on the album version]

I'm looking at you through the glass

Knowing you don't care.
And if I sleep just to dream of you
I'll wake without you there.

Amie,Damien Rice,"Nothing unusual, nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario, the same old rain
And there's no explosions here
Then something unusual, something strange
Comes from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?

Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
You know when you've found it,
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it when they take it away

Something unusual, something strange
Comes from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere

Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

Love Is a Losing Game,Amy Winehouse,"For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made

Love is a losing hand

Though you're a gambling man

Love, it is a fate resigned

Over futile odds

Makes me love and love them more

Leave it open for someone else to

Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse

I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away

Wish the rain would just let me

Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

Broken inside.

Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.

She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.

She wants to go home,
But nobody's home.
It's where she lies,
Broken inside.
With no place to go,
No place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

She's lost inside, lost inside, oh oh oh.",2004,sad
Landing in London,3 Doors Down,"I woke up today in London
As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was monday
And maybe ill be back around

If this keeps me away much longer
I dont know what i will do
Youve got to understand its a hard life
That im going through

And when the night falls in around me
I dont think ill make it through
Ill use your light to guide the way
Cause all I think about is you

Well L.A is getting kinda crazy
And New york is getting kinda cold
I keep my head from geting lazy
I just cant wait to get back home

And all these days i spend away
Ill make up for this i swear
I need your love to hold me up
When its all too much to bear

And when the night falls in around me
I dont think ill make it through
Ill use your light to guide the way
Cause all I think about is you

And all these days i spend away
Ill make up for this i swear
I need your love to hold me up
When its all too much to bear

When the night falls in around me

Snuff,Slipknot,"Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...

My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your lights
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...

Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...

Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...",2008,sad

Pierrot the Clown,Placebo,"Leave me dreaming on the bed, see you right back here tomorrow, for the next round

Saw you crashing 'round the bay, never seen you act so shallow, or look so brown
Remembered all the things you'd say, how your promises rang hollow, as you threw me to the ground

And if you're ever around, in the backstreets or the alleys, of this town
Be sure to come around, I'll be wallowing in pity, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

When I dream, I dream of your lips
When I dream, I dream of your kiss
When I dream, I dream of your fists
Your fists

Heartbeats,José González,"[The Knife cover]

One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away

Both under influence
We had divine scent
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief

Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough",2003,sad

The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times

'Cause nobody loves me

Of innocence, descent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....

Burnt lungs, sour taste

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

And go mad for a couple grams

And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man

High Hopes,Pink Floyd,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever",1994,sad

Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Sweaty hands
And my foot in the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands
In the mild issue of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love

I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

And they only hit until you cry
After that, you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore

Glycerine,Bush,"It must be your skin I'm sinking in
It must be for real 'cause now I can feel

Everything's gray

Remember that

Where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields

I treated you bad
You bruise my face
Couldn't love you more
You got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by

Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me

Clear and simple and plain

Broken,Lifehouse,"The broken clock is a comfort
It helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow
From stealing all my time

And I am here still waiting
Though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best
Like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain
There is healing
In your name
I find meaning

So I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm barely holdin' on to you

The broken locks were a warning
You got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded
I'm an open book instead

And I still see your reflection
Inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose
They're still looking for life

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain (in the pain)
Is there healing
In your name (in your name)

So I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')

I'm hangin' on another day
Just to see what you will throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will, will be OK

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating

November,Azure Ray,"So I'm waiting for this test to end
So these lighter days can soon begin
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly

I was afraid to be alone
But now I'm scared that's how I like to be
All these faces none the same
How can there be so many personalities?

So many lifeless, empty hands
So many hearts in great demand
And now my sorrow seems so far away
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain

But I turn them off, and tuck them away
Until those rainy days that make them stay
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs
And the words still ring, once here, now gone

And they echo through my head everyday
And I don't think they'll ever go away
Just like thinking of your childhood home
But we can't go back, we're on our own

Ohh...

But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself

So we're speeding towards that time of year
To the day that marks that you're not here
And I think I'll want to be alone
So please understand that I don't answer the phone

I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls
Until I can see nothing at all
Only particles, some fast, some slow
All my eyes can see is all I know

Ohh...

But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself

Set the Fire to the Third Bar,Snow Patrol,"I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from 'A' to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their words mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground
I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground

Epitaph,King Crimson,"The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams

Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying

Between the iron gates of fate
The seeds of time were sown
And watered by the deeds of those
Who know and who are known
Knowledge is a deadly friend
If no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools

The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams

Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh

A man who drinks just to drown the pain
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else

Shape Of My Heart,Sting,"He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance

[Live version:] The hidden laws of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

He may play the Jack of diamonds
He may lay the Queen of spades
He may conceal a King in his hand

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

Mockingbird,Eminem,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)",2004,sad

How I grieve now you're gone

But the strength I always loved in you
Finally gave way

Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Somehow I knew you could never.. never stay
And in the early morning light
After a silent peaceful night
You took my heart away
And I grieve

In my dreams I can see you
I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you
And it feels so real

I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love

And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And somehow I knew you would leave me
And in the early morning light
After a Silent peaceful night

It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth.

So Sorry,Feist,"I'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh actions of mine
When patience is in short supply

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh we, we could hold each other tight tonight

We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the ocean
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
No the answer isn't for us

[Live Version:
Oh, I'm sorry
But I'm hanging up my hat
No, I just can't go on
Mmm, that's how I feel until I hear that song]

I Don't Love You,My Chemical Romance,"Well, when you go
So never think, I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

Well, after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
Is where you ought to stay

Well, after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
Whoa, whoa

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Well, come on, come on

When you go
Would you have the guts to say
""I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday""

I don't love you
Like I loved you

I don't love you
Like I loved you

Ice Water,Cat Power,"Like I heard her backwards saying
""I can take one thousand showers
and never be clean""

She is ten times heavier
Stronger, than you found the grave

You know what I need
Who doesn't lie?
You know what I mean

If I'm ever in doubt you
Like you don't know
I am so, angry
I am so, at ease
I feel just like
Some great big disease

I think you need
Ice water
But the only thing that
You really hate
Is all its emptiness
I will swim
And I will drink myself to
Death

Under the Bridge,Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend

The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am

Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

Gonna give my heart away

Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look from outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
It's all I wanna be is all woman

Existentialism On Prom Night,Straylight Run,"When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,

The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,

Just a little bit,

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,

I Am a Rock,Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",1966,sad
If You're Not the One,Daniel Bedingfield,"If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

Seem to care what your heart is for

The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

But you crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

She's Lost Control,Joy Division,"Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.
And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And of a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.

And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

Well I had to phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.
But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

I could live a little better with the myths and the lies,
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried.
I could live a little in a wider line,
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone,
To lose control. When here we come.",1979,sad

Still care

Separate my side I don't

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind

Take it on the otherside
Take it on

A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't

Burn me out leave me on the otherside

It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again

Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
There's this ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

His fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread

Play Crack the Sky,Brand New,"We sent out the SOS call.
It was a quarter past four in the morning when the storm broke our second anchor line.
Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.
They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.
One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.
What they call love is a risk, cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own.
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out.
And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow.
Your tongue is a rudder.
It steers the whole ship.
Sends your words past your lips or keeps them safe behind your teeth.
But the wrong words will strand you.
Come off course while you sleep.
Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reef.
The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.
To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.
And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.
But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm.
But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.
We won't have to fight for long.
This is the end.
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear.
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath.
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea.
I spoke the words but never gave a thought to what they all could mean.
I know that this is what you want.
A funeral keeps both of us apart.
You know that you are not alone.
Need you like water in my lungs.

i will make my way, through, one more day in hell...
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...
i will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
i'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey i won't change direction, and i won't change my mind
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make..
how much difference...
i'll swallow poison, until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
how much difference
how much difference
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...",1993,sad
A Modern Myth,30 Seconds to Mars,"Did we create a modern myth
Did we imagine half of it
What happened then, a thought for now

Save yourself
Save yourself
The secret is out
The secret is out

To buy the truth
And sell a lie
The last mistake before you die
So don't forget to breathe tonight
Tonight's the last so say good-bye

Oh Mother,Christina Aguilera,"Whoa, oh, yeah,

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again

So mother, I thank you
For all that you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over,
""You deserve much more than this.""

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)
Together we always pull through.
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again

For everytime he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)
Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)
Together we always pull through (always pull through)
We always pull through
We always pull through

Never Too Late,Three Days Grace,"This world will never be

You're Not Sorry,Taylor Swift,"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around

And you're thinking we'll be fine again

You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry

I can't break the spell

You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in

And my mouth can't speak

Flowing into your arms
Falling into your eyes

I might lose my mind

Just a Dream,Carrie Underwood,"It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt.""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh,

Why'd you have to go?

A Long December,Counting Crows,"A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California...I think you should
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass
And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should",1996,sad

Don't Give Up,Peter Gabriel,"in this proud land we grew up strong

I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

no fight left or so it seems

I've changed my face, I've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose

don't give up
'cos you have friends
don't give up
you're not beaten yet
don't give up
I know you can make it good

though I saw it all around
never thought I could be affected
thought that we'd be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn

drove the night toward my home
the place that I was born, on the lakeside
as daylight broke, I saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground

don't give up
you still have us
don't give up
we don't need much of anything
don't give up
'cause somewhere there's a place
where we belong

rest your head
you worry too much
it's going to be alright
when times get rough
you can fall back on us
don't give up
please don't give up

'got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
going to stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing
that river's flowing

moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job, so many men
so many men no-one needs

don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not the only one
don't give up
no reason to be ashamed
don't give up
you still have us
don't give up now

don't give up

Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain

Romeo and Juliet,Dire Straits,"A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like ""You and me babe: how 'bout it?""

Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo. You nearly give me a heart attack.""
He's underneath the window; she's singing, ""Hey, la, my boyfriend's back.
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that.
Anyway what you gonna do about it?""

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah.
Now you just say, ""Oh, Romeo, yeah. You know, I used to have a scene with him.""

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade

Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me.

So the years went by, I stayed the same
But she began to drift away, I was left alone
Still I waited for the day, when sheâd say ""I will always love you.""

Lonely and forgotten, never thought sheâd look my way,
And she smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do,
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful,
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
When she loved me.",,sad
It's a Motherfucker,Eels,"It's a motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And i won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
Getting through a sunday
Talking to the walls
Just me again
But i won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
How much i understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same",2000,sad
In the End,Linkin Park,"[Chester Bennington:]

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

To explain in due time

All I know

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

Got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down,Interpol,"When she walks down the street,
She knows there's people watching.
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Days
Daze
Days
Daze

She was all right because the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She is all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight, air tight
She broke away, broke away

At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
From crevices caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells
Stella, Stella, Stella, Stella I love you

Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, love-joy diver
She went down down down there into the sea,
Yeah she went down down down there, down there for me, right on

So good, oh yeah, right on

Place to Be,Nick Drake,"When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place

And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be

And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh, so weak in this need for you",1972,sad

Half Life,Imogen Heap,"I knew that I'd get like this again
That's why I try to keep at bay
Be a hundred percent when I'm with you and then
A perfect heart's length away

You never promised me anything
Even sat me down, warned me just how they fall
And I knew the odds were I'd never win

yet here I am
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been 2 days and 8 minutes too slow
There may well be others but I still like to pretend
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with

You've got a schedule to stick to
Got a world to keep sweet
You're so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down? Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts to sign
Hold me darling, please

A daft life

With you as my quarterback
A daft life

You know you'll never be lonely
You know you'll always be loved
And maybe you'll never need more than that
But of the surplus that loves, what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?

Long for one last showdown
From a box in the crowd, air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life",2009,sad
Too Much Love Will Kill You,Queen,"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long

I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down

How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all.
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

From across the distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass

Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say,
""We have come now to the end.""
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again

And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping

What can you see

The ships have come to carry you home

On our bodies we share the same scar
Love me, wherever you are

How do you love with a fate full of rust?
How do you turn what the savage tame?

To love you, again and again

How do you love in a house without feelings?
How do you turn what the savage tame?

How we've failed and I feel like I do

First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain

They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me

Than waiting to win the lottery

I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts...... ooh, ooh love hurts

Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

All the things that I never thought
That she could feel 

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought I wouldn't have to be with you
Something new

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know that you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
You left my heart soaking wet
Boy your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
With me
Hiding

Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn't choose between
The shower or the bath

And I thought I wouldn't have to be
With you
A magazine

No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's clear he's gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel

So are you gay?
Are you blue?

Come true for awhile

Harder than I could

Homesick,Kings of Convenience,"I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,

of two soft voices
blended in perfection
from the reels of this record that I've found.

Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me...
What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
growing increasingly unclear.

I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
all the other options held before me,
would wither in the light of my plan.

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
but there's only one thing on my mind
searching boxes underneath the counter,
on a chance that on a tape I'd find...
a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.

In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so

Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down

You can tell the sun in his jealous sky

These Are the Days of Our Lives,Queen,"Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago.
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect. You know?

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young.
The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know.
The rest of my life's been just a show.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you.

You can't turn back the clock,
You can't turn back the tide.
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
When life was just a game.

No use sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives.
They've flown in the swiftness of time.
These days are all gone now,
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you.

It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
it's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
I want you
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""

The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight
I never should've let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathomed that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?

Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'

So I turn the dial
Tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please

I see one pair that I recognize
And I know

That I am

Telling strangers personal things

At the site of a beautiful woman they feel nothing but 
Anger, her skin makes them sick in the night nauseaous, nauseaous, nauseaous

And I tap on their shoulder and they turn around smiling

When you stand they fall, yeah

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Comin' down the years turn over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and
All because I'm
All because I'm
And I'll become
What you became to me",1998,sad
Where I Stood,Missy Higgins,"I don't know what I've done
Or if I like what I've begun
But something told me to run
And honey you know me it's all or none

There were sounds in my head
Little voices whispering
That I should go and this should end
Oh and I found myself listening

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

See I thought love was black and white
That it was wrong or it was right
But you ain't leaving without a fight
And I think I am just as torn inside

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
This is what I have to do

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could

Are You There?,Anathema,"Are you there?
Is it wonderful to know
All the ghosts...
All the ghosts...
Freak my selfish out
My mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me

But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
And I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind

But what can I say now?
It couldn't be more wrong
Cos there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Did we lose all the love that we could have shared
And its wearing me down
And its turning me round
And I can't find a way
Now to find it out
Where are you when I need you...

Are you there?",2003,sad

It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday,Boyz II Men,"How do I say goodbye to what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through

If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

How to Be Dead,Snow Patrol,"Please don't go crazy, if I tell you the truth
No you don't know what happened

Where you've had me for hours
Till I'm sure what I want
But darling I want the same thing that I wanted before
So sweetheart tell me what's up I won't stop no way

Please keep your hands down
And stop raising your voice
It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
It's a simple suggestion can you give me sometime
So just say yes or no
Why can't you shoulder the blame
Coz both my shoulders are heavy
From the weight of us both
You're a big boy now so let's not talk about growth
You've not heard a single word I have said...
Oh, my God

Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I haven't made half the mistakes
That you've listed so far
Oh baby let me explain something
It's all down to drugs
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
It seems I've stepped over lines
You've drawn again and again

And throw a living past away
So you can be sure that you're in control

Keeping ahold of what you just let go

Lover I Don't Have to Love,Bright Eyes,"I picked you out 
Of a crowd and talked to you 
Said I liked your shoes
You said thanks can I follow you? 
So it's up the stairs 
And out of view
No prying eyes 
I poured some wine 
I asked your name you asked the time
Now it's two o'clock, 
the club is closed we're up the block
Your hands on me 
I'm pressing hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth 
Trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know 
Who else may have been you before
I want a lover I don't have to love 
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time 
You said it feels good I said I'll give it a try
Then my mind went dark 
We both forgot where your car was parked 
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning
Bad actors with bad habits 
Some sad singers 
They just play tragic
And the phone's ringing 
And the van's leaving 
Let's just keep touching
Let's just keep keep singing
I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind
But you but you 
You write such pretty words
But life's no story book 
Love's an excuse to get hurt 
And to hurt 
""Do you like to hurt?"" 
""I do! I do!""
""Then hurt me."" [fades]",2002,sad
Father And Son,Cat Stevens,"[Father:]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

[Son:]
How can I try to explain, cause when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

[Father:]
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

[Son:]
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me

The Closest Thing to Crazy,Katie Melua,"How can I think I'm standing strong, 
Yet feel the air beneath my feet? 
How can happiness feel so wrong? 
How can misery feel so sweet? 
How can you let me watch you sleep, 
Then break my dreams the way you do? 
How can I have got in so deep? 
Why did I fall in love with you? 

[CHORUS:]
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been 
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen, 
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known, 
I was never crazy on my own... 
And now I know that there's a link between the two, 
Being close to craziness and being close to you. 

How can you make me fall apart 
Then break my fall with loving lies? 
It's so easy to break a heart; 
It's so easy to close your eyes. 
How can you treat me like a child 
Yet like a child I yearn for you? 
How can anyone feel so wild? 
How can anyone feel so blue?

Cat's in the Cradle,Harry Chapin,"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while""
He shook his head and said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

bring him home again

My lover's gone

Tiny Tears,Tindersticks,"You've been lying in bed for a week now
Wondering how long it'll take

Always with that melancholy smile
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
To see those tiny tears in her eyes

Tiny tears make up an ocean
Tiny tears make up a sea
Let them pour out, pour out all over
Don't let them pour all over me

How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
Someone you said you'd always be there for
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
When those tears start rolling you'll be back

Tiny tears...

You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
But now it seems that moment has arrived
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight

The River,Bruce Springsteen,"I come from down in the valley 
where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
when she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
and man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
and the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
they haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
that sends me down to the river 
though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight 
Down to the river 
my baby and I 
Oh down to the river we ride",1980,sad

Blew every dollar that we ever made

And sing along with every song we'd know

Landlocked Blues,Bright Eyes,"If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And ones pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up I say ""enough is enough,
If you walk away, I'll walk away""
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon 

And the world's got me dizzy again
You think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
If you love something, give it away

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke 
We're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
Cause we're coming for you!

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying ""let me walk away, please""
You'll be free child once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn
Putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to",2005,sad

I understand the fascination
The dream that comes alive at night
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die
Please don't die

You're the one who's always choking trojan
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Drunk on immorality
Valium and cherry wine
Coke and ecstasy
You're gonna blow your mind

I understand the fascination
I've even been there once or twice or more
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die
Please don't die [x4]",2001,sad
Blue American,Placebo,"I wrote this novel just for you

I read a book about Uncle Tom 
Where a whitey bastard made a bomb
But now Ebonics rule our song
Those motherfuckers got it wrong
And I ask
Who is uncle Tom?
Who is uncle Tom?
Who is uncle Tom?
You are

I read a book about the self
Said I should get expensive help
Go fix my head
Create some wealth
Put my neurosis on the shelf
But I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself

Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,Backstreet Boys,"Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be

To feel the things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
But we know that you are gone

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night, thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time, that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same
That was until the day before the day",2008,sad
Everything Means Nothing To Me,Elliott Smith,"Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
Who keeps singing over everything

Everything means nothing to me
I picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
The reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me",2000,sad

Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light it ends here tonight

I'll miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears

Closing your eyes to disappear,
You pray your dreams will leave you here;
But still you wake and know the truth,
No one's there...

Say goodnight,
Don't be afraid,
Calling me, calling me as you fade to black.

Tom Traubert's Blues,Tom Waits,"Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
In your silhouette window light go
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs,
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows, go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on an
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers
And goodnight to Mathilda, too",1976,sad

Well the trees grow, the river flows
And its water will wash away my sin
For I do believe that everyone
has one chance to fuck up their lives
Like a cut down tree, I will rise again
I'll be bigger, and stronger than ever before

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back

There's a hope in every new seed
And every flower that grows on the Earth
And though I love you, and you know that
Well I no longer know what that's worth
And I'll come back to you, in a year or so
And rebuild ready to become
Oh the person, you believed in
Or the person that you used to love

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back",2009,sad

Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way

You're just so pretty in your pain

Give up my way, and I could be anything
I'll make my own way
Without your senseless hate... hate... hate... hate.

And hate me, if it feels good.

I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

Do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

In a dream you appeared
For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I'll draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep re-living

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

This is it
Let go

You don't have to love me
For me to, baby, ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy
Cause I don't want to hold you
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy

Do do do
Do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do
Be happy

Mmmm....
Be happy",2008,sad
I Shall Believe,Sheryl Crow,"Come to me now
And lay your hands over me
Even if it's a lie
Say it will be alright
And I shall believe

I'm broken in two
And I know you're on to me
That I only come home
When I'm so all alone
But I do believe

That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And I shall believe
And I shall believe

Open the door
And show me your face tonight
I know it's true
No one heals me like you
And you hold the key

Never again
would I turn away from you
I'm so heavy tonight
But your love is alright
And I do believe

That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly
You won't give up on me

Title and Registration,Death Cab for Cutie,"The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it.
So i'm proposing a swift orderly change.

Cause behind its door there's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all i find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life.

I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When i stumbled upon pictures i tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head

Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here i rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all

Things Behind the Sun,Nick Drake,"Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth

Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say?

Look around you find the ground
Is not so far from where you are
But donât be too wise

For down below they never grow
Theyâre always tired and charms are hired
From out of their eyes

Never surprise

Take your time and youâll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see whatâs meant to be
Donât name the day or try to say
It happened before

Donât be shy you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done
If only you see

Just what you are beneath a star
That came to stay one rainy day
In autumn for free

Yes, be what youâll be

Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while 
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth
Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say

Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes thatâs today
And open wide the hymns you hide
Youâll find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what youâll say

About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people round your head
Who say everythingâs been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain",1972,sad
River Man,Nick Drake,"Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves.

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me.

Oh, how they come and go.",1969,sad
Right Here Waiting,Richard Marx,"Oceans apart day after day

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you",1989,sad
In My Life,Johnny Cash,"There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Someone Great,LCD Soundsystem,"I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming, 
Till the day it stops

But there, that's the problem.

Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.

You Know I'm No Good,Amy Winehouse,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy
He's in a place, but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we're married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet

Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

Only in Dreams,Weezer,"You can't resist her

She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her

In between molecules
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide 

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 

You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, 'Hey baby
I just might take the chance'
You say, 'It's a good thing
That you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way
I will crush your pretty
Toenails into a thousand pieces.'

Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers

a breath between us could be miles

let me surround you
my sea to your shore
let me be the calm you seek

Other Side of the World,KT Tunstall,"Over the sea and far away

Waiting to change

She wants to be like the water

Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same
Just like water

The fire fades away
Most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world to me

On comes the panic light
Holding on with fingers and feelings alike
But the time has come
To move along

Can you let me go
And can you still love me
When you can't see me anymore

Cure For the Enemy,Billy Talent,"Time drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads

We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spend the time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

We said that we would call
But we never spoke at all
The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
For reasons that seem so small
If this is the end, let's bury the past
This might be our one last chance
Together until the last grain of sand
Has dropped from the hourglass

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy

All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds

I thought about the way
You loved days like this

And driving in to town
It really started coming down
Bringing me back around
To all that I miss

It feels like it's rainin' you
It feels like it's rainin' you

I didn't even run inside
Or worry about staying dry
Besides there nowhere I can hide
These feeling now

Running down my face
Takes me to another place
I can't think of a better way to drown

It feels like it's rainin' you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's rainin' you

If I had my way
It would do this every day
I would never see the sun
Because the closest I get
To holding you again
Is every time that sky opens up

I hear you laughin' in the rain.
I still can't believe you're gone.

It ain't fair: you died too young,

But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who'd you be today?

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family,
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue,
I feel like I can talk to you,
An' I know it might sound crazy.

It ain't fair: you died too young,

In newspaper columns they write about me
round dinner tables and cocktail parties

I'm a heroine as I'm lying here
Beneath my sky

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Why we're always coming down
And why we need to touch the ground
And why I didn't keep on heading
right on up to heaven

Here from below the clouds are shadows
Not the golden mountains I used to fly through
Here from below the sky?s a painting 
In a child's room with the future waiting
But not for me

I look up at the birds flying overhead
My sentinel's true but the signals dead
It's been 500 days of hope and sorrow
500 nights with no tomorrow
And the poetry and the best of me
And the heart and the spirit and the sex of me
All fell into the azure sea
In the tailspin with the last of me
And my wings, and my song, all that I knew is dead and gone
I'm weak and tired but my will is strong
And my hope lives on, my hope lives onS

Is better than goodbye

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm",2014,sad
Reason,Fool's Garden,"Bye, bye -
It's the same old wind again that calls me
- bye, bye -
on an ordinary day.
Bye, bye -
have you ever felt this lack of freedom
- bye, bye -
have you ever felt this way.

Leave it, don't leave it - I have to leave,
I can't go on pretending.
Nothing is real, don't you feel
that every road is ending.
Don't ask why i have to leave you,
don't you try, there have to be two.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand,
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

I've said it all - holy eyes -
no more sweet surrender.
Forget it all - no more lies,
soon we will remember that
everything we tried to change
stayed always and always and always 
the same.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand,
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we cannot walk each other way.

We will never find the answer
as long as we don't understand
we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

There's a light inside the hollow,
there's a light behind the wall,
but we've got different lights to follow,
we have to fall, so let us fall.

I was afraid - I couldn't hear you,
I was ashamed but now I know
that we got different roads to follow,
that we got different ways to go.

We will never find a reason.
wWe will never find a reason.

We will never find a reason,
we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

Why Does It Hurt So Bad,Whitney Houston,"[Chorus:]
Why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
Thought I was over you 
But I keep crying 
When I don't love you 
So why does it hurt so bad 
I thought I had let you go 
So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
It hurts so bad 
Oh it hurts so bad baby 

My life's been better 
Since the day I left you boy 
I must admit life's been kind to me 
I went and did the things I said I would boy 
I found someone who loves me for me 
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy 
My heart's never been more at ease 
And when I think of all the things you put me through 
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
I thought I was over you 
But I keep crying

So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head

Hurts so (hurts me so) 
Hurts so bad (did you know)

Just when I think it's through 
I find myself right back in love with you

Why do I feel so sad

Shadows and Regrets,Yellowcard,"I'm back, back in town
And everything has changed
I feel, feel let down
The faces stay the same
I see, see shadows
Of who we used to be
When I drive, drive so slow 
Through this memory

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest 

I heard, heard myself
Say things I take back
If I could, could retell
And make these stories last
I see, see shadows
Of who you'll always be
I drive, drive these roads
Made of memories

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go from the rest
Shadows and regrets
We let go from the rest 

Everything has changed
Faces stay the same
Everything has changed
Faces stay the same

And we were only kids 
And our time couldn't end 
And how tall did we stand 
With the world in my hands 
And we were only kids
And we were best of friends

And let go of the rest
And shadows and regrets

We Can't Be Friends,Deborah Cox,"To just act like we never were 
To come around and not show hurt 
How dare we greet by shaking hands

But I just can't get over you girl

We can't be friends 
We can't be friends 
We can't be friends

I went by Mother's, saw your car there 
To her you're still family, and it don't seem fair 
For everyone to just go on 
And I've tried and I can't do it 
'Cause I'm still torn 
I've tried to think of you 
As just another love in my past 
That didn't last 
But it's not that simple baby 

[Chorus]

You may see me staring 
Or catch me in a daze 
May see me hang my head 
When you come my way 
Don't get too close to me 
And expect me to behave 
I might just steal a kiss 
If you come near my face 
What I'm trying to say

Quiet As A Mouse,Margot & the Nuclear So and So's,"Tourists rob you of your home 
In sunken boats
You can hide quiet as a mouse
But they'll find you out

When she asked me, ""Why have you felt so down and out?
You can stay with me at my house.""

When I woke my back was broke from lying on the floor
Sunlight poured through all the cracks in my front door
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

Tourists robbed me of my child
They smoked him out
He was draft dodging some war
Until they found him out

He came home late in the night
To his mom and me
And he said, ""Times they gotta change,
But so do we.""

When I woke I was alive in somebody's room
I felt life and love and hope infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

When I woke my body was dying all over the floor
I felt apathy and hate infested my bones

There Is None,The Working Title,"[Verse 1]

Last night for quite some time
Wishing to tell you
Everything running through my mind
We would have drove down
Over the bridge and towards the sea
Parking the sad car
In between 24th and 5th

I want to write a song about our love
But there is none

Still I continue
Driving the lonely road
My thoughts running over
Humming a sad forgotten song
Wasting all our time
That you're spending with someone else

And calm my nerves to look and find
Words that aren't enough
And never show a single piece of my mind

Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last

Just forget those heart felt pleas

Deform to Form a Star,Steven Wilson,"Oh once in a while
I learn how to smile
Horses shadows and rain on stone

No god here I'm sure
This must be the cure
For all this carrion and aimless drift

Retreat from the begging
And invites to the wedding
Revelation means nothing here

In time we forget our
Need to devour
All the stories of tortured souls

Crawl into your arms
Become the night forever
Coiled and close, the moment froze
Deform to form a star
Here on earth together
I got time to share and a well used stare

This smile isn't pure
Certain or sure
Cold precision was never there

The way we uncoil
Return to the soil
Flaws are everything and chaos reigns",2011,sad
Rite of Spring,Angels & Airwaves,"I was locked all day in the summer heat,
In a small brown house in Suburban Street,
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I'd dream all day that they would get me far,
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen, 
Got kicked out of school, and so it seemed
that things were closing in and ready to blow,
My dad moved out about that year or so,
It took an hour to start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I held my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for has come to pass
From Rock N Roll, to love and cash
Itâs all success if itâs what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

We might get back together

Off to such a good start but somehow it seems
We've let our hearts fall apart at the dreams
We could throw in the towel walk away with our pride
Say it just wasn't worth all the tears that we've cried

But then again, if we give it one more try

The Little Girl,John Michael Montgomery,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name
Never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off
Cause He was there in my old house
And held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died",2000,sad

So dry your eyes I understand just what you're going through
Cause I took this same walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes

Down our long dusty driveway
I set my mind to go
I was eighteen and wild and free and wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked at the world and at his grown man and said,
""Don't worry boy it will be all right""

Down our long dusty driveway
This time we both would go
He had grown old and gray
And his mind was wandering
Daddy took me by the hand
Said, ""I know where we're going and I understand
Don't worry boy it will be all right""

I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger,
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...

...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?
I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh (uh, oh)
The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls.",2010,sad

Permanent,David Cook,"Is this the moment where I look you in the eye?
Forgive my broken promise that you'll never see me cry
And everything, it will surely change even if I tell you I won't go away today
Will you think that you're all alone
When no one's there to hold your hand?
And all you know seems so far away and everything is temporary rest your head
I'm permanent

I know he's living in hell every single day
And so I ask oh god is there some way for me to take his place
And when they say it's all touch and go I wish I could make it go away

I Miss You So Much,TLC,"I never asked for this feeling
I never thought I would fall
I never knew how I felt
Till the day you were gone
I was lost
I never asked for red roses
I wasn't looking for love
Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what all at once
I'm in love

[Chorus:]
Oh I miss you so much
I long for your love
It's scares me
Cause my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily
Baby why aren't you missing me?

Why did I act like you mattered
It was silly of me to believe
That if I just opened my heart
Things would come naturally
Jokes on me (yeah)
I did not ask for love letters
So why did you give them to me
How could I let your intentions
Get hold over me
So in love
So naive (oh baby)

And oh how I hate what you have done
Made me fall so deep in love
God knows
You're the only one I want
That I love oh baby

Soldier On,The Temper Trap,"Who wants to know

All that is gold is rusting
No one will know
When seasons cease to change and:
How far we've gone
How far we're going
It's the here and the now
And the love for the sound
Of the moments that keep us moving

Waves crash along
The battered, lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow she's gone
And if not, someday somehow
Are these hands a waste
Well this side of mortality is
Scaring me to death
To death

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
And don't think about it all

Keep your heart close to the ground

Bosco,Placebo,"I love you more than any man, but something's getting in the way.
I do you harm because I can for the second time today.
Victims we are not of happenstance, but you're a victim all the same.
Stuck inside a circumstance with your confusion and your blame.

[Chorus:]
And when I get drunk, you take me home and keep me safe from harm.
When I get drunk, you take me home.

I ask you for another second chance, but then I drink it all away.
And I get bellicose when you react full of frustration and dismay.
I was so delicate when we began, so tender when I spoke your name.
But now I'm nothing but a partisan to my compulsion and my shame.

[Chorus]

You know, I'm grateful, I appreciate.
But in fact, it's baleful how I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.
How I suck you dry.

I love you more than any man, but I seem to lay it all to waste.
I do you harm because I can with a joke in questionable taste.
I've such duplicity at my command, so I keep on lying to your face,
Then I run away to wonderland, and disappear without trace.

You know, I'm grateful, I appreciate..
But, in fact, it's baleful how I suck you dry.

How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly,
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now u cant even remember mine)

How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could You How Could You just forget about me?

How Could You put him up to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How Could You put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How Could You How Could You just forget about me?

You must be out ya mind,
You got alot of nerve (to think that im gone chill after all the shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for ya,

You should have thought of me b4 you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I cant believe that u did this to me

Can't believe the ways u repaid me,

Breaks My Heart,Monica,"[Verse 1]
When I think of what I've done
All the pain that I brung
Baby you should've walked out on me
And when I turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me
And it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should've been mad at you

[Chorus]
Baby it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe
After everything you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just being your girl

[Verse 2]
Never gave you my heart
Cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt
When deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need
And I always gave you up
Whenever I thought something better comes along
And right when I come back
You're waiting for me
And you welcomed me home.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if it takes my whole life
I'll make it up to you
Cause I've been so cruel
You've given your love to me
In spite of everything
I don't deserve you
From this day forward
I'm truly yours
and it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for lovin' me

I Will,Chris de Burgh,"I'm going to an island,
Where the sun will always shine,
Where the moon is always riding on the sea;
And when I go I'll leave behind,
These chains that hold me down,
The time has come to set my spirit free,
Ah ah ... I will

And there beside a mountain stream,
I'll build a house of stone,
And work the wood of cedar, pine and fir,
And then I'll make a garden,
And I'll plant a field of corn,
Press my hands deep into Mother Earth,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Yes I will,
Oh I will,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
I want to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will...  And then I'll teach my children love,
Like every father should,
For we are part of every living thing,
And speak of half-forgotten words,
Like peace and joy and good,
For the world can only live when love can sing,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Oh, yes I will,
I will,
And they will be a part of Nature once again,
Oh they will feel a part of Nature once again,
The time is now,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will, ah ah, someday I will, (someday I will)",1977,sad
Tom Drunk,Ky-Mani Marley,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Let me tell you of a story
'Bout a creature I once knew
Had a wife that was a teacher
And the daughter was it too

He was loved among his neighbors
For the wonders works he's done
For the building of the new church
And the work for rodness funds

But things change and times got rough
And his wife is acting strange
And the friends Tom once knew so well
Just don't seems the same

Now Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Now instead of getting better
Things started to get worse
When they dropped off from the ministry
And burnt down Tom's new church

After all the things that Tom had done
It seems like no one care
Now Tom is sitting all alone
Shedding lonely tears

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Oh, oh, no, yeah
Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

To much stress, can't bare the pressure
So he sips the Devil's water
Reach at home, he rapes his wife
Then he turns and beats his daughter

Can't believe [?]
Then he slowly caught the hammer
Put the fist into his hand
Then he bowed and said the prayer

Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone, Tom is gone
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone Tom is gone

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

And played a fool
And lost his crew now

Do You Believe In Loneliness,Marc Anthony,"I used to try
To set aside
Some Time for being lonely

So many times 
I prayed to find
Someone like you to hold me

I'm not alone
I just simply close me eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

Do you believe in loneliness
I do now that's where I found you and I'll never let you go
When all I knew was onlyness
There you were
With you around
Who's lonely now

I feared the night
But now it's mine
'Cause something's out there for me

Let's take our time
I'm satisfied
With having you to own me

All I know is that when I think of you I'm not alone
I just simply close my eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

David played and pleased the Lord

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind),Dru Hill,"[Spoken:]
I just can't believe it, girl 
I can't believe that it's over 
But I'm your man, and I'll be alright 
But still, the love we had 
Stays on my mind 

Lately baby, I've been thinking 
How good it was when you were here 
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking 
For once I feel my head is clear 

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes 
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise 
I guess you meant more to me than I realized 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 

And lately girl, I've been remembering 
The good times that we used to share 
My thoughts of you don't have an ending 
And memories of you are everywhere 

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern 
You win some, you lose some 
Well I've lost and I've learned 
Sisqo's so lonely 
With no place to turn 
And here at the end, I find 
Yes I do 

The love we had stays on my mind 
Girl, if you were nearer 
If you had a mirror 
Maybe you could count my tears 

And if you were nearer 
It would all be clearer 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish, how I wish 
How I wish that you were here 

And baby girl I was tired 
So I laid down to dream for a little while 
But lately I've been so, so uninspired 
Without the comfort of your smile 

But I'm not complaining 
Cuz that's how it goes 
There's always some heartache 
In this world I suppose 
But you can't imagine 
But nobody knows 

The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind

To start a life and maybe change the world

No I never meant to let you go at all
Oh, no
Oh, no
Don't ever say goodbye
See my head aches from all this thinkin'
Feels like a ship God, God knows I'm sinkin'
Wonder what you do and where it is you stay
These questions like a whirlwind, they carry me away
Who will bring me flowers when it's over
And who will give me comfort when itâs cold
Who will I belong to when the day just won't give in
And who will tell me how it ends and how it all begins
Oh, no 
Oh no

Dark Turn of Mind,Gillian Welch,"Take me and love me if you want me
Don't ever treat me unkind
'Cause I had that trouble already
And it left me with a dark turn of mind

Now I see the bones in the river
And I feel the wind through the pine
And I hear the shadows a-calling
To a girl with a dark turn of mind

But oh ain't the nighttime so lovely to see?
Don't all the nightbirds sing sweetly?
You'll never know how happy I'll be
When the sun's going down

And leave me if I'm feeling too lonely
Full as the fruit on the vine
You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some have a dark turn of mind

You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some girls are blessed with a dark turn of mind",2011,sad

For all the words I've never understood
I know, I know

The wind that blows from here to California
Never stops to turn and wonder why it goes
And you don't have to tell me when you're leaving
For all the plans I've never understood
I know, I know

Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know

To have your things and wait there for a plane ride
No one there to sit and hold your hand in flight
But everyone I know out here is lonely
Even those that have someone to lie beside at night

Leave me with the dawn
It's almost gone
I know, I know
Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know",2004,sad
Four Become One,Hawthorne Heights,"And you will live on
Our hearts will beat stronger
As we remain as one
We will last just a little while longer

And as we pull ourselves together
We can't help, but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

Now the time has come now
And we must figure out
Driving north or going south
Growing up or falling down

And as we pull ourselves together
We can't help, but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

Goodbye Kiss,Kasabian,"Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again",2011,sad
Where Did You Go?,MxPx,"I dream that someday I will find you
The blue skies turn to rain
And they're never coming back again
I've got your picture in my mind here
You're the one that got away
I was begging you to stay with me

Where did you go I just don't know?
My life is scattered in the wind
I'm trying to begin again
Where did you go I just don't know?
I don't wanna cry myself to sleep again
I don't wanna wake up all alone again

I've never been dealt a hand like this
With face cards running dry
And rain falling from the sky
What could have been if you had stayed
Broken dreams would mend
You'd be sitting in the summer wind with me

But all I've got are memories
And dreams of how my life could be
Dreams of how my life could be.",2006,sad
All I Want Is You,Julie Roberts,"What I need is medication
In the form of a vacation
What I need is skies of blue

What I need is a perspective
One that's healthy but objective
What I need is a point of view
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

What I need is bread and water
And a father for our daughter
What I need is someone new
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you
(Only you)

What I need is loss of memory
To forget when you were with me
What I need is to admit we're through

What I want, what I need
Oh, what I want is you (only you)
What I want is you

All I want
Is you",2006,sad

Where You At,Joe,"Where you at

Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at

[Joe]
Every word I cut you down is playing in my head
Like a scar face crime scene ain't no bringing it back
Those tears didn't mean much to bun now I know
That you said you didn't feel it to the wind starts to get cold

[Chorus:]
Only she's the woman like the car I replaced it
No sleep I wonder if she saw this bullet coming like this
Only words that I can hear in my ear is the gesture your gon' the seeds
You planted in the fields
Baby where you at when you sitting on my pillow case no more
Baby where you at I just recognized I'm living life alone
Baby where you at I just wish just wish you'd call me
Damn this phone baby where you at
Doc said I only got four weeks my whole life just flashed before me

[Joe]
Oh, oh, ohhhaaa (how foolish could I be)
Wild as can be
Never (never) fear be humble (humble)
Got me out to face my fate
May never have a choice to be honest (honest) with the one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of taken you off that stage

[Chorus]

[Papoose]
Yea Papoose, Pap, Papoose
They say you never know what you have till you lose it
You promise your girl something you better do it
You can't tell a woman you love her are you stupid
Words don't express you love you got to prove it
Back then our relationship wasn't the truest
Grown man slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on I become foolish
Now your gone everything ruined
But girl this is Papoose I'm on your favorite track
I know your friends are in your ear
But baby come back and I never let you down so later for that
I told you I was gonna make it I was the savior of rap
And I work hard you don't got to cater to Pap
I tie my own do-rag
Lay back and relax
You don't even got to accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it acknowledge me

[Joe]
Awhooo babe
If anyone up in here wasn't just like me
Awhooo babe
Treat her like this wasn't last week
Wont you call babe (wont you call)
No this song babe
Girl you know this song is hearing me
Damn I regret when I almost pass me

If I Were You,Tamia,"I look in the mirror, with you in my arms
And I see a reflection
Of a smile that says you believe in love
And just for a moment, I drifted away
But I couldn't stay cuz
A hint of love, a bit of fear
I'm tryin' to say

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
Ooh yeah

I'm tryin' to protect you
From the lies that your heart tells
Even though it says that you love me
All I see is pain and misery
Seasons may change
But I can't forget the days of old
My heart ached when you walked away
I said I'd never love again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here

The days go by
And I feel that you could make me happy
Time goes on
And I feel that love is at my door
And though I tell myself that you're the one
Who said those words before
Thought it hurts too much
I can't trust in love

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are

My Road,Jorn,"Empty was the cradle before I learned to walk
I crawled to find out where the song played
The music and the melody were captured by the heart
And so my road to light and darkness had begun

The dream inside the vision fueled within my mind
Has guided me to some where in between
Wandering the twilight in a circle of fire
Sent here to burn in this wheel of yearning
As I'm turning

The promised land is hidden beyond this life and time
But somewhere in the distance hides the sun
Brave into a new world we stumble to the fall
Into after all
I can feel death call",2012,sad

Make You Feel My Love,Ronan Keating,"When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing

A Waste of Space,Dayshell,"Today the presence's over, awake the dead for closure
Believing in true, I love you

A waste of space is cliche,
The thought of endless betraying me like a fool,
So who needs you.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

Tonight my love is unsafe,
I'm left with doubts and mistakes,
Collapsing into the bottle of you.
If I could rewind and go back,
I'd destroy the place that we first me at.
And I just might.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

You took the best of me, the best of me.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe

You say I'm invincible, but they all seen me bleed
And I know, you've done this before",2013,sad
Angel,Jamey Johnson,"The voice on the telephone sounds awful angry
And somehow it doesn't fit in
With the face in the picture I keep on my dresser
Of the girl I once called my best friend

We drank from the fountain of good times and dreaming
But these lawyers have poisoned the well
And as our love is dying they're making a killing
On heartaches and furniture sales

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?

Am I right or is she right or are we both wrong?
Or is it even about that at all?
As Heaven is fading we're fighting and fussing
And the devil's just having a ball.

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?",2008,sad
I Who Have Nothing,Joe Cocker,"I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but, oh
I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you

He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when, darling, it's I
Who loves you

I love you
I love you
I love you",2004,sad

Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wonderin' if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman to
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do

Underneath Your Clothes,Shakira,"You're a song

Because of you

When the party's over

It's kinda hard to talk right now.
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?

Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight

Speechless,The Veronicas,"Feels like I have always known you
And I swear I've dreamt about you
All those endless nights I was alone
It's like I've spent forever searching
Now I know that it was worth it
With you it feels like I am finally home

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

Cuz you leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
Can't help but surrender
My everything to you

I thought I could resist you
I thought that I was strong
Somehow you were different from what I've known
I didn't see you coming
You took me by surprise and
You stole my heart before I could say no

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

You leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender
Oh no
My everything to you

You leave me speechless

Along the tracks of a train

Set myself free again

Welcome to My Life,Simple Plan,"Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you're screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark

To be on the edge of breaking down

No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like


To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)

A Lonely September,Plain White T's,"I'm sittin' here all by myself
Just tryin' to think of something to do
Tryin' to think of something, anything
Just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know it's not working out
'cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

I'm sittin' here tryin' to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back

I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight

I'm sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone it's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
We've got nothing left to prove

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

And I didn't mean to meet you then
We were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back

Poem to a Horse,Shakira,"You're to far to bring you close
And too high to see below
just hangin' on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
You start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

[Chorus:]
I'll leave again 
Cuz I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'd rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
Cuz to talk to you is harder work 
So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
Cuz there's a foot for every shoe 
I wish you luck but I've got other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've
Been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more",2001,sad
Without A Kiss,Badly Drawn Boy,"All the songs have been sung
Youâre too old and then youâre too young
Did you leave your mark on the world
One as deep as true love
Letâs sing Hosanna

All the stories are told
Youâre too young and then youâre too old
Did you leave a mark on the world
One that lasts as long as true love
Take me with you now

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
And someone you saw again
Back to haunt you there and then
Please take on my love

Evolution is real
Secrets we have never revealed
Did you leave your mark, was it real
Or as deep as the love we both feel

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
Like a gift you didnât keep
And it leaves a mark so deep

Thereâs a million things to miss
Like the chance to take that kiss
where you go, youâll be someone
With one kiss your life is swung

What you gonna do when you walk away
Walk behind me, itâs alright, Iâm Ok
Then what will you do if I walk away
Walk beside me, itâs alright, weâre Ok
Where you gonna do, donât surrender
Hold me tight, donât let go",2006,sad

3 to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl

Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl

Can't see nothing at all

Black Hole,Lindsay Lohan,"I found that box of letters
Lying on the ground
The ones you used to write me before it all went down
I even got a papercut trying to figure out
What to do with all these memories
And you're not who you used to be
And I wonder where your gone

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love? [2x]

Remember all those hours laughing on the floor
Those days of doing nothing fell like nothing did before
I don't need those sneakers or that money after all
I'll trade them for old message you've called

'Cause it's not how we used to feel
And I wonder what went wrong

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we felt so much?
Where's the love?
I wanna go there, and I wanna know where
Everything that meant something to me is all

I found that box of letters, used to make me smile
But now I feel so lonely

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where had so much?

There's A Place For Us,Phil Collins,"'...There's a place for us, somewhere a time and a place.' 

So here we are together
just you and me
sitting side by side
don't know why
with time just racing by
but I don't want to go

Well I don't know much about it
'cos all I am is what you see
in front of you
there's no more
feels so close and yet so far
but I don't want to go

Here I am, take my hand
here I am, please take my hand

I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright
if you don't mind I could sit and stare all night
sit here waiting for you to hold me tight

It's sad but I know it's true
you see I know you well
you'd only laugh at me
and that would hurt me so
just look at me here
you've got me pleading with you
but i don't want to go

'Cos you know that I love you so
yes you know that I love you so

Here. I will be here love
for you love, I will always be here love

If you look real close
you'll see my heart is on my sleeve
and it'll be here waiting
waiting for you, waiting for me
someone once said that if you truly, truly believe
you can make things happen
make things appear to be all that they seem
tell me do you believe?

We'll find a hideaway
together we'll find a way
somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way
there must be somewhere
there must be someplace
we can find somewhere
where they don't know my face
believe me we can find it
yes we can find it

The Suburbs,Arcade Fire,"In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

Love Is Blindness,Jack White,"One, two, three
Two, two, three

Love is blindness,
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness.

I'm in a parked car
On a crowded street,
And I see my love
Made complete.
The thread is ripping
The knot is slipping.
Love is blindness.

Love is clockworks,
And it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Blindness

Love is blindness
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness

A little death
Without mourning
No call
No Warning
Baby, a dangerous idea...
Almost makes...sense

Love is drowning
In a deep well
All the secrets
And no body else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey
Blindness

Love is blindness,
I'm so sick of it,
I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
And wrap it all around me, now
Oh my love
Blindness

Oh, I'm too numb to feel...
Blow out the candle.

Wish I had my radio.

I tune in to some friendly voices
Talking 'bout stupid things.
I can't be left to my imagination.

Real Men,Tori Amos,"Take your mind back - I don't know when
Sometime when it always seemed
To be just us and them
Girls that wore pink
And boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men

Is he rough or is he rugged
Is he cultural and clean

But nobody's really sure
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
See the nice boys - dancing in pairs
Golden earring golden tan
Blow-wave in the hair
Sure they're all straight - straight as a line
All the gays are macho
Can't you see their leather shine
You don't want to sound dumb - don't want to offend
So don't call me a faggot
Not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall and handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
Time to get scared - time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady
Don't know how to be a man
Time to admit - what you call defeat
'Cause there's women running past you now
And you just drag your feet
Man makes a gun - man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink
And man can take a whore
Kill all the blacks - kill all the reds
And if there's war between the sexes
Then there'll be no people left

Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation, my palate got clean
Now I could taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

No, it doesn't seem right

Change the name of the game 'cause he lost
And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I've said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels
Step out of this sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

Island,Heather Nova,"There are parts of me he'll never know, my wild horses and my river beds, and in my throat voices he'll never hear.
He pulls at me like a cherry tree, and I can still move but I don't speak about it.
Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead. He's to scared to hit me now - he'll bring flowers istead

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere to go

And the dogwoods shimmer in October sun, ""oh sweet thing"", he sings to me,
""You're the only one.""

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you, 
Somewhere to go.

And I don't know why I can't tell my sister, He spat in my face again, and I don't want to die here. You know that dream when your feet won't move, you want to come but your body won't let you. He steals it from me.He steals it from me. It shines like sweat, like jewels, like something that has died to soon. He fucks with the beauty. A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick, a kiss kiss kick. He steals it from me. It's out of my hands again.

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere to go, to go.....",1994,sad

Strong Enough,Stacie Orrico,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there anyway to be made whole again?
If I'm healed,renewed, and find forgiveness find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and it turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I've finally found

That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh Thank You for my chance to start again",2003,sad
Blue,Lucinda Williams,"Go find a jukebox and see what a quarter will do 
I don't wanna talk I just wanna go back to blue 
Feed's me when I'm hungry and quenches my thirst 
Loves me when I'm lonely and thinks of me first 
Blue is the color of night 
When the red sun 
Disappears from the sky 
Raven feathers shiny and black 
A touch of blue glistening down her back 
We don't talk about heaven and we don't talk about hell
We come to depend on one another so damn well
So go to confession whatever gets you through
You can count your blessings I'll just count on blue

When the red sun 
Disappears from the sky 
Raven feathers shiny and black 
A touch of blue glistening down her back

Ends,Everlast,"Everything must change...
Ends...

[Chorus:]
Some people would rob their mother for the ends
Rat snitch on one another for the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered for the ends
So before we go any further I want my ends

I knew this cat named Dale
Who didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material
Ivy League scholar
Had a PHD
An MBA
But now he's waitin' tables 'cause there's rent to pay
Company's down sizin'
Inflation's risin'
Can't find a job
He's feelin' kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he's been blessed
So he falls off track
Starts smokin' the crack
And once it hits his brain
It starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back
The shoes off his feet
He's losin' all his teeth
Now he's out on the street
And all of the sudden he's like Jesse James
Tryin' to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school
And he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew this chick named Sally
She had a nice strut
And everywhere that I went she was up in the cut
Swingin' that butt like ""place your ad here""
Only rapped the Benz
And rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearin'Champagne wavin'
Jewels around the neck
A lotta style she's cravin'
Ain't no savin'
She's doin' all the spendin'
If you do the lendin'
She'll do the bendin'
Straight machine vendin'
That's money for tail
Shoppin' sprees get her on her knees
And then you hit her with the keys of your krib you actin' funny
Come home one day find her countin' out your money
From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo
If you broke she's spittin'
If you're rich she might swallow
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew these two homeboys
That made a lot of noise
Makin' money on the block
The kids was on their jock
They was tougher than leather
Like Reverend Run
DMC they was totin' guns
Holdin' weight
Goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips
And pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and clothes
And got no job
And then one disappeared
And one got robbed
For the ends

The World You Love,Jimmy Eat World,"I got a story it's almost finished
all i need is someone to tell it too
maybe, that's you.

our time is borrowed and spent to freely
every minute i have needs to be made up
but how?
i'm looking for a nice way to say
""i'm out.""
i want out.

i fall asleep with my friends around me
only place i know, i feel safe
i'm gonna call this home

the open road is still miles away
Hey nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

Windows open and close
that's just how it goes

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

i'm in love with the ordinary
i need a simple space
and rest my head
everything gets clear
well i'm a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps 
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it (over it)

it might seem like a dream
but it's real to me

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesn't seem theres hope for me
i let you down
but i won't give in now
not for any amount

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy

Less Is More,Joss Stone,"Don't go sending me those three dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do
Don't go trying to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm making money too

Don't go throwing those stones outside my window
You don't gotta be calling three times a day
'Cause if you do then when we get together
I'll be biting my lip 'cause there's nothing else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]
Less is more
Back it up slow it down let it breathe
Cause you too much of a good thing can be
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember

If you wanna be showing your affection
Don't you know a simple kiss will do
So many beautiful ways for love's expression
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't getting through

Haven't you heard a little space makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]

It would be something if I had a chance to be missing you
Too much for taking it's driving me crazy
That's all you do
It needs rearranging
It's so suffocating
That I can't move
You gotta take two steps back
Believe what they say
It's true

[Chorus]

Gimme a chance to miss you
Boy I don't mean to diss you, but 
I tell you I need some space and still you call me up three times a day
You know, baby you crowding me out
Haven't you heard less is more

Less is more",2004,sad
Name,Goo Goo Dolls,"And even though the moment passed me by 
I still can't turn away 
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
Got tossed along the way 
And letters that you never meant to send 
Got lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans 
And never knew their names 
We don't belong to no one 
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me 
Maybe for a while 
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far 
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast 
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history 
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name 
I won't tell em' your name 
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I won't tell em' your name
Ow!

The Perfect Ending,Straylight Run,"Taken in context,
It's not a bad thing,
But when you start to pick it apart,
It gets so depressed,
It's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity,

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,
There are no perfect endings,

You peel back the layers
And get down to the inside,
But sometimes you loose sight,
Of what it was you were trying to find,
And it's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,
There are no perfect endings,

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Is it you I want or just the notion
Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around?

Safe to say from here,
You're getting closer now,
We are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,

Is all that I could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
To lie here under you is all that i could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,

So lost and alone 
And I can't take feelin' like that 

Baby I've had enough 
I just wanna move on 
Don't wanna look back 
Coz I know I gotta be strong 

I don't wanna care about love anymore 
I don't wanna care about us 
I don't want to care about love: 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care anymore",2006,sad
Lime Tree,Bright Eyes,"I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message said it's done,
It's done

When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Just come inside

But I keep going out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m. my heart is beating too loud
Too loud
Don't be so amazing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched

Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
If you don't

It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune

So I just won't be late
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took",2007,sad
A Sight for Sore Eyes,Tom Waits,"hey sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see

hey i'll play you some pin ball hell you ain't got a chance
well then go on over and ask her to dance",1977,sad
Shake It Off,Mariah Carey,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial life
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off

I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

[Bridge]
I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial life
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciated all the love I give

Gotta do what's best for me

Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore,LeAnn Rimes,"It might be hard to be lovers
But its harder to be friends
Baby pull down the covers
Its time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
Ill just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Dont you think its time we say
Some things we havent said
It aint too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why dont you look at me
Til we aint strangers anymore

Sometimes its hard to love me
Sometimes its hard to love you too
I know its hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life

With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

[Solo]

Its hard to find forgivness
When we just run out of lies
Its hard to say youre sorry
When you cant tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So lets get down to it baby
There aint no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers

All Cried Out,Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh you, all over you, ooh

Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener (why oh why)
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong? (Leavin' me all alone)

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I, I don't what to do
I'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)
(Whoa, whoa...)

My heart never knew such pain

Forever,Papa Roach,"In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds by his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her... He'll never forgive her

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl... little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroine
In this moment I'm lonely fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs all these women
I'm never forgiven... this broken heart of mine

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever

And save your soul 
Save your soul 
Before you're too far gone 
Before nothing can be done 

I'll try to decide when 
She'll lie in the end 
I ain't got no fight in me 
In this whole damn world 
Tell you to hold off 
You choose to hold on 
It's the one thing that I've known 

Once I put my coat on 
I'm coming out in this all wrong 
She's standing outside holding me 
Saying, 'Oh, please 
I'm in love 
I'm in love'

Girl save your soul 
Go on save your soul 
Before you're too far gone 
Before nothing can be done

The Ballad,Millencolin,"The last selection in the ballgame.

no girls, no sweet romance.
It's impossible to expand,
when you never get a second chance.

Do you care enough to see?  He's in pain and misery.

He's not going to the school-prom.
He said he had the flu.
Jumped-up excuses as he told mom.
-I'm safer here with you.
She told her son.  -Someday, they'll all be
sorry for mistreating you.
Don't be afraid my son and trust me.
-You'll be someone they will look up to.

Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

Nine am to the beat of a drum,
As we drive through the canyon,
I'm feeling the hum of the engine,
My head and my heart are a-swim-will your cat be ok?
Your wife was she in?
Your wife, is she in???
'Cause I don't presume to know shit about you,
When you won't really tell me until I beg you to,
But I know that perplexity's a wonderful thing,
It's a sudden found joy, the strangeness it brings...

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

I like that we argue,
But not everyday,
Your scent in a room,
The way that you say 'color' not 'colour'.

What colour today?
It's grey, grey, it's grey.

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.",2005,sad
Understanding Salesmen,Eels,"A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But i would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

While i look out
On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield
Makes me feel
Like i
Don't matter

A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls",2005,sad
Dying in the Sun,The Cranberries,"Do you remember
The things we used to say?
I feel so nervous 
When I think of yesterday

How could I let things
Get to me so bad?
How did I let things get to me?

Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying [x2]

Will you hold on to me
I am feeling frail
Will you hold on to me
We will never fail

I wanted to be so perfect you see
I wanted to be so perfect

Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying [x2]",1999,sad
Looking For Water,Alex Parks,"Some days are harder than others
Mountains we climb to get things done
Trying to make sense of the way I'm feeling
Looking for sanctuary but finding none

You're in my head, you're in my heart
Too busy to stop, too late to start
I don't wanna hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Some people are stronger than others
One smile can make some people cry
Hiding away won't make it easier
Taking you're hand, but I ask you why

You're in my head, you're in my heart
Too busy to stop, too late to start
I don't wanna hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Don't you ever listen?
I really need you to
You're in my head, you're in my heart

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Had Enough,Breaking Benjamin,"Milk it for all it's worth.
Make sure you get there first.
The apple of your eye.
The rotten core inside.
We are all prisoners.
Things couldn't get much worse.
I've had it up to here, you know your end is near.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Hold me down (I will live again)
Pull me out (I will break it in)
Hold me down (better in the end)
Hold me down.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Heaven help you.

Will I Ever Make It Home,Ingram Hill,"I woke up from my sleep to the sound of that voice
From the words that I heard I had no choice
They told me I had to turn around
My assurance slowly faded down
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind

The plans that I had were quickly destroyed
The problem was one I couldn't avoid
They welcomed me to stay overnight
I'm too tired to complain so i just might
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
To the place I recognize
Far from here and where I've been
And all the places that I've been shown
Will I ever make it home
Can they keep me here for good
Where I hardly know a soul
And my fear keeps going on

My weariness keeps growing inside
My patience is starting to subside
And I hope I'll be there soon
It can't be long or I'll fall through

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind
Till there is no turning back
Will I ever make it home 
Get to where I wanna be
Find the ones who wait for me
To the place where I belong
Will I ever make it home",P:  ,sad
Love Me For Me,Ashlee Simpson,"It's been three days
You come around here like you know me
Your stuff at my place
Next thing you know, you'll be using my toothpaste
Step up, sit down
Get ready, let me tell you who's the boss now
Stay here, get out
Everytime I turn around you're in my face

Don't care where you think you've  been, and how you're getting over
If you think you've got me down
Just wait it gets much colder

Here I am,
As perfect as I'm ever gonna be
You'll see
Love me for me
Stick around,
I'm not the kinda girl you wanna leave
You'll see
Love me for me

Shut up, come back
No I didn't really mean to say that
I'm mixed up, so what
Yea you want me so you're messed up too
I love you, I hate you
If you only knew what I've been through

My head is spinnin'
But my heart is in the right place
Sometimes it has to have itself a little earthquake

Here I am,
As perfect as I'm ever gonna be
You'll see
Love me for me
Stick around,
I'm not the kinda girl you wanna leave
You'll see
Love me for me

I've been waiting all my life
To finally find you
Just so I can push you away
And when you're crawling over broken glass to get to me
That's when I'll let you stay

Oh, here I am
As perfect as I'm ever gonna be
You'll see
Love me for me
Stick around,
I'm not the kinda girl you wanna leave
You'll see
Love me for me
Love me for me

Sorry,Ashlee Simpson,"[Bonus Track]

I threw away my phone
I thought that you should know
I'd throw away my home
If I had somewhere to go
Anything to stop
The circle in my brain
Anything is better than you
Making me feel lame

28 days to kick the habit
28 days to let you go
28 days and I'll be on my own

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing and nothings such a waste
All this time I've been sayin I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes

Why should I be sorry

I've had enough of you
Please forget my name
I'm runnin around on empty
Still tryin to get away
Anything to kill
The consciousness of you
Anything to end myself
Before the thought of you

28 days to kick the habit
28 days to let you go
28 days and I'll be on my own

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing and nothings such a waste
All this time I've been sayin I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes

Now you'll know what it feels like to bite your tongue
Now you'll know what it feels like to be the one
Who walks around with knots in your stomach
I've been there, and I've done it
And now you'll know what it feels like
To always be afraid
Of everything you wanted to say
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing and nothings such a waste
All this time I've been sayin I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing and nothings such a waste
All this time I've been sayin I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes

I Can't Help Myself,The Kelly Family,"If I would tell you
How much you mean to me

Until this day comes
When you will understand me

And I can't stop myself
I cannot control myself

Sleeper 1972,Manchester Orchestra,"When my dad died the worms ate out both his eyes.
His soul flew right up in the sky and I cried myself to sleep.

My mother lies alone on her back at night.
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep.

When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep.

The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise.
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping.

I still see you inside of this God-awful house
You move awfully quiet now
And I still feel you everywhere
You told me this has always been worth living,
But what's really worth living anymore?",2006,sad
Avondale,Yellowcard,"If you're gonna rip my heart out
Could you use a knife that's dull
And rust in color
Once I die
There will be no way that you can cover
That scar. It's hard, I know.
And if I get a little blood on, you
Finally the world will know you're guilty
Know you're wrong
Of taking everything you're gotten from me
No heart. It's hard, I know.

Mighty King of Avondale
I just can't let this go
Real life ain't no fairytale
I just thought you should know

And when you're finished with the surgery, I
Really hope that you will turn to me, and
Tell me all about the fun you had
When you were cuttin up
You were cuttin up

Living like a fairytale
The Mighty King of Avondale
It all went to his head, this royalty
I stuck a knife into his back
Inventiveness is what I lack
He's always hanging up on loyalty",P:  ,sad
Two People Fell In Love,Brad Paisley,"A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
'Fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up fillin' their paper plates
They've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[1st Chorus]
There ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

Well, I recall a young man who was driftin' aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafÃ°Â³ right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lotta help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[2nd Chorus]
Baby, there ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
I'm glad your dad could not resist
Your mama's charms and you exist
All because two people fell in love

[Tag]
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon",2001,sad
I Don't Need a Man,The Pussycat Dolls,"I see you looking at me

'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you
I don't ever want to leave you confused

The more you try

I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete
So let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around
Oh!

You know I got my own life
And I bought everything that's in it
So if you want to be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal
And baby I don't need a hand
If it only wants to grab one thing

The more you try
The less I buy it
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feeling you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger

Lullaby,David Gray,"Its a sad old world
That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning 
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window 
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

All these useless emotions 
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken 
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
Cos I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead

Hear the bells",1994,sad

Without hurting you
I wanted to let you go
With right and pretty excuse and leave you

Until you hold onto me

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love
With someone else

You did not want anything
You always gave everything to me
You are happy to see me happy
You always looked upon me

But your love becomes tiring more and more
I will not make excuse, I will tell you all

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
Someone else

I sometimes worry
But I forget all about you
I am truly in love

At the end of beautiful love
I didn't want to tell you all
Because you will be hurt
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love with

Shelter,The xx,"I find shelter, in this way
Under cover, hide away
Can you hear, when I say?
I have never felt this way

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Could I be, was I there?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown, whenever you leave
Please teach me gently, how to breathe

And I'll cross oceans, like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll mirror images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Re: Stacks,Bon Iver,"This my excavation and today is Qumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun and the moon
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down
In a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He is dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load

It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be

I live with are numberless

Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you

With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad
I know, let them not weep
Let them know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart

Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you

Abel bought a bag of weed
And even the last of the brown-eyed babies see
That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
There ain't a penthouse Christian wants the pain of the scab, but they all want the scar
How every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of love
And how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking of

Cain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop
Abel heard his papa pray
And even the last of the black-eyed babies say
That every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sell
That the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen help
There's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall

of all the wheels in Ivory Town.

and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there; 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist.

it's come to this,

go out and talk to a friend.

there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit; 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit;

Painted like an unknown saint

And old
And always empty

Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please
Say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand forever
Lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words

Planet Caravan,Pantera,"We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs

The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night

The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night

And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe",1994,sad
A Fond Farewell,Elliott Smith,"The Litebrite's now black and white
'Cos you took apart a picture that wasn't right
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
The only maker that you want to meet
A dying man in a living room
Whose shadow paces the floor
Who'll take you out in the open door
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend
He said really I just want to dance
Good and evil match perfect, it's a great romance
And I can deal with some psychic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in your kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
I'ts just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend
I see you're leaving me
And taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in-between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend",2004,sad
Don't Believe in Love,Dido,"I wanna go to bed
With arms around me
But wake up on my own
Pretend
That I'm still sleeping
Til' you go home

Oh
I can't look at you
This morning
I should probably have a sign
That says
'Leave right now or quicker'
You've overstayed your time

If I don't believe in love
Nothing will last for me
If I don't believe in love
Nothing is safe for me
When I don't believe in love
You're too close to me

You have to leave

Maybe I slept peaceful
On your shoulder
Your arm warm around my side
But it's different now
It's morning
And I can't face your smile

The second that I feel
Your safe hands
Reaching out for mine
I slip away and out of sight
You've ovestayed your time

If I don't believe in love
Nothing is good for me
If I don't believe in love
Nothing will last for me
When I don't believe in love
Nothing is new for me
Nothing is wrong for me
And nothing is real for me

When I don't believe in love
Why do you care for me?
When I don't believe in love
Nothing is real for me
If I don't believe in love
You're getting to close to me
And that's why you have to leave

Tomorrow Wendy,Concrete Blonde,"It is complete, now
Two ends of time are neatly tied
A one-way street
She's walking to end of the line
And there she meets
The faces she keeps in her heart and mind

They say, ""Goodbye""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die

Underneath the chilly gray November sky
We can make believe that Kennedy is still alive
And we're shooting for the moon
And smiling Jackie's driving by

And they say, ""Good try""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked
The first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought it would get us
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Hey, hey, good bye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Only God says, ""Jump""
So I set the time
'Cause if he ever saw her
It was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered
It was me who did his crying

Hey, hey, goodbye

Death Makes Artists

Only once I could see my dream
Didn't feel the smallness under the stars
Once I got bars in my cradle
As a prisoner I write a letter from there

My Lord, to you, let me become what my child thinks I am
In you is the beauty of the world, of which death made me an artist
My Lord, to you, let me become what my child thinks I am

My own heaven I created here
Let me get away
My own heaven I created here
Let me get away",2004,sad
Disappear,Dream Theater,"[music by Myung, Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess]
[lyrics by James LaBrie]

Why, tell me the reasons why
Try, still I don't understand
Will I ever feel this again
Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
Free them, free the memories of you
Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you

A day like today
My whole world has been changed
Nothing you say
Will help ease my pain

Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
Burn, burn to feel alive again
She, she'd want me to move on
See me, this place I still belong
Give chase, to find more than I have found
And face, this time now on my own

Days disappear
And my world keeps changing
I feel you here
And it keeps me sane

So I'm moving on
I'll never forget
As you lay there and watched me
Accepting the end
I knew you were scared
You were strong I was trying
I gave you my hand
I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
And I'll carry on
The best that I can without you here beside me
Let him come take you home",2002,sad
River of Tears,Eric Clapton,"It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away,
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today.

It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face,
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace.

Lord, how long have I got to keep on running,
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is, since you've been gone
I feel like I'm drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feel like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river.

In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace.
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face.

I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain,
But my time's run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again.

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here.
You'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in the river.
Lord, how long must this go on?

Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.",1998,sad
Mercy,Sarah McLachlan,"Mercy - pure and simple
Longing - cold and hollow
With sweet breath you'd come to warm me
But I held on too hard to only a memory
You lie there on the swollen ground
Deserted in your heart
Still longing for what yesterdays lost
And for all that tomorrow might bring
The passion lost - taken, stolen
The dreams we had and we shared - shattered, broken
With kind words you'd come to soothe me
But I go blind and filled with fear
Would send you away from me
There is no hope in regretting now
All the pain that we could not see
We both knew what we wanted
And we took it believing it free
And we took it believing it free.",1991,sad

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10

What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

To tell me lies

Guess that's what made me dumb

Not like you want it

Waste your time
You know he ain't right

I don't wanna listen

Which one of us
Is really dumb

Go No More A-Roving,Leonard Cohen,"[Dedicated to Irving Layton]

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.",2004,sad

I am the pick in the ice.
Do not cry out or hit the alarm,
You know we're friends 'til we die.

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off,
It's always better on the outside.
Fifteen blows to the back of your head,
Fifteen blows to your mind.

So lock the kids up safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard.
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling.

That either way he turns - I'll be there
Open up your skull - I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls

With a single pillow underneath your single head.

And I hope you have more luck with this than me.

You used to think that someone would come along.
And lay beside you in a space that they belong.
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new.
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

Other than a sick desire for self-abuse.

Barricade,Stars,"Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
You were the only thing that mattered
There was no one for me but you
In Harmony Street we beat a man
Just for standing there
I held my breath as I watched you swing
Then run your fingers through your hair

Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do?
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you?

In Bermondsey in Burberry, you held me at the barricade, the pigs arrived with tear gas
And I wept at the mistakes we made
We stalked the streets like animals
And danced as windows shattered
For our island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered

Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart?
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart?

I found you on a Saturday, and that was where I lost you
You had finally walk away because of what it cost you, years later when I saw your face
In line to catch the morning train, you looked like you'd been softened
Like you never really loved the pain

Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish?
The thrill of blood comes instantly
There's only darkness at the finish

Meet me at the barricade, I'll be at the barricade
Meet me at the barricade, the love died, but the hate can't fade
I'll be at the barricade, the love died, but the hate won't fade...",2007,sad
Love and Some Verses,Iron & Wine,"Love is a dress that you made
long to hide your knees
love to say this to your face,
""I'll love you only""

what will you keep for to wear?
someday drawing you different,
may I be weaved in your hair?

Love and some verses you hear
say what you can't say
love to say this in your ear,
""I'll love you that way""
from your changing contentments,
what will you choose for to share?
someday drawing you different,
may I be weaved in your hair?",2004,sad
A Comet Appears,The Shins,"One hand on this wily comet
Take a drink just to give me some weight
Some uber-man I'd make
I'm barely a vapor

They shone a chlorine light on
A host of individual sins
Let's carve my aging face off
Fetch us a knife
Start with my eyes
Down so the lines
Form a grimacing smile

Close your eyes to corral a virtue
Is this fooling anyone else?
Never worked so long and hard
To cement a failure

We can blow on our thumbs and posture
But the lonely are such delicate things
The wind from a wasp could blow them
Into the sea
With stones on their feet
Lost to the light and the loving we need

Still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing

With burnt sage and a forest of bygones
I click my heels
Get the devils in line
A list of things I could lay the blame on
Might give me a way out

But with each turn
It's this front and center
Like a dart stuck square in your eye
Every post you can hitch your faith on
Is a pie in the sky
Chock full of lies
A tool we devise
To make sinking stones fly

And still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing",2007,sad
Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),The Beatles,"I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good

You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,The Beatles,"Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away",1965,sad
High Times,Elliott Smith,"Coma kid
Tell me how you come to follow you around where ever you go
Said I don't go, where I'm supposed go
And I don't go, really anywhere you know
Told me how hes driven by a curse, 'til he kicked out into reverse
Said I don't go, where I'm supposed to go
And I don't go, really anywhere you know
I made up my mind, and I don't mind sayin so
I went to meet you at central square
When I couldn't find you there,
I went walking around the city some more
People watching with a cold blank stare
And I saw your face, in everyone I swear
Seems like I never get your kick quite right
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
High times
High times
High times, yea I feel fine

Don't Go Down,Elliott Smith,"I met a girl, a snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe had been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Stay with me 
Baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me

Champagne From a Paper Cup,Death Cab for Cutie,"I think i'm drunk enough to drive you home now
I'll keep my mouth kept shut from under lock and key
That's rusted firm, no lie
'cause all these conversations wind on and on...
Drinking champagne from a paper cup
Is never quite the same
And every sip's moving through my eyes 
And up into my brain
At half past two; about time to leave
'cause the dj's playing rhythm and blues
A sad-sorry state, stutter step to those slammin' grooves
As i'm waiting around for you...",emo ,sad
Goodbye,Emmylou Harris,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I will never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I See a Darkness,Johnny Cash,"Well, you're my friend and can you see,
Many times we've been out drinkin',
Many times we've shared our thoughts,
But did you ever, ever notice, the kind of thoughts I got?

Well, you know I have a love, a love for everyone I know.
And you know I have a drive to live, I won't let go.
But can you see this opposition comes rising up sometimes?
That it's dreadful imposition, comes blacking in my mind.

And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.
And that I see a darkness.

Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you,
Can save me from this darkness.

Well, I hope that someday, buddy, we have peace in our lives.
Together or apart, alone or with our wives.
And we can stop our whoring and pull the smiles inside.
And light it up forever and never go to sleep.
My best unbeaten brother, this isn't all I see.

Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.
Oh, no, I see a darkness.

How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I would still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom

No I don't think you do

And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret.

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life in cocaine
Just a rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways
Such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You're so young. So sweet. So surprised

I saw a sign says ""OK""
Gotta take a ride just recline in the faraway
Got to take some time to realize
That my friends they come
And the lines they go by

And know that I am gone
You'll feel it in your heart

You'll rise each day as planned
Your will is your command
And stand each Sunday
A hymnal steady in your hand

And you'll sing to yourself
The rising falling melody
That you could never read
Without the choirs' lead
Still alone and lost in deep
And your soul will not be free

I will go, I will go, I will go
And in wars waters I will wade
And I will know if I remorse or regret
The fairness of our trade

For you to live, I took your place
A deal was made and I was paid
And the goal as I was told
Was a place where my body could be laid

And we will steal your life
And I own in better homes surrounded
By your peers without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near
And none will shed a tear

Leave our lives behind
I'll watch the stars go out

We'll take our hearts outside
Leave our lives behind

To take these songs for real
Is it asking too much of my partner's hands
To take these songs real

As the stars are going out
And this stage is full of nothing
And the friends have all but gone
For my life my god I'm singing

We'll take our hearts outside
Leave our lives behind
I'll watch the stars go out
We'll take our hearts outside
Leave our lives behind

We'll take our hearts outside

Sky is Over,Serj Tankian,"Everybody knows

The minds ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures
Your not-so-gentle persuasion
Has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over

Disappointed, going crazy

Confident as cops
Blooming, laughing in the shops

Walking through the park
Pushing grocery carts

He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black

Can you see him in his lounger
Watching TV in the dark
Waiting for a spark
Till the sun turns black

Who are we
Oh oh oh oh oh
Who are we

Trudging through their days
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting

Living, loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity

See the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit (cut) me

Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you - and I know it's over - still I cling

""And if you're so very entertaining then why are you on your own tonight?""

I know - 'cos tonight is just like any other night - that's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms - while they're in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind - over and over...
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes guts to be gentle and kind - over and over...

Sleep,The Roots,"[Verse 1: Aaron Livingston]
Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
Iâve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldnât wish them on than worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
Iâm dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
Iâm fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
Itâs unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies

You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight

Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide

In four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight

You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight

Says I'm too dumb to fuck
Too dumb to fight
Too dumb to save
Well maybe I don't need no angel at all

Coming down into Miami

Make a halo with your hands

Alone

All the cards

At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn

Than flesh and bone

Is all you own

A house

There's a woman

There's a heart I love

What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted,Jimmy Ruffin,"As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere...",,sad
If I Was Your Vampire,Marilyn Manson,"6 a.m. Christmas morning.
No shadows,
No reflections here.
Lying cheek to cheek
In your cold embrace.

So soft and so tragic
As a slaughterhouse.
You press the knife
Against your heart.
And say,
""I love you, so much you must kill me now.""

I love you
So much
You must kill me now.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,

Until the sun.
If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come.

Digging your smile apart
With my spade-tounge.
The hole is where the heart is.
We built this tomb together,
And I won't fill it alone.
Beyond the pale
Everything is black,
No turning back.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.

Our time has come

Drive me off the mountain.

I'll eat your ashes.

But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last

Sometimes I wonder what might

At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way
My future is not set
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live
without regret.

her head lifted high to the light in the sky
the opening dawn on her face...

And never again will my letters start

And all of birds will sing to your 
beautiful heart
Upon the bough

And no more shall we part

Has been silenced now
And all of those birds 
Would've sung to your beautiful heart

Don't go down

Alone You Breathe,Savatage,"You were never one for waiting
Still I always thought you'd wait for me
Have you from your dream awakened
And from where you are what do you see

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You're thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder
Staring from this end into your life

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

And if this is all illusion
Nothing more than pure delusion
Clinging to a fading fantasy

Like Icarus who heeds the calling
Of a sun but now is falling
As the feathers of his life fall free
Can you see
See

Tomorrow
And after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here
Believing
That in the dark
There is a clue

Perhaps inside
This midnight sky
Perhaps tomorrow's new born eyes
Or could it be
We'll never know
And after all
This was the show

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Standing on a dream
Isn't what it seems
Could we then reclaim a dream refused
Knowing what we know
Could we let it go
Realizing that all the years are used

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue
I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue",1994,sad
I Saw a Light,Bat for Lashes,"I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
Freshly cut lawns
And little children sleepwalking
I saw a light

I saw a light
Shining on a car
And a couple inside
Had committed suicide

Death in your arms
Death in your arms

I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
And I packed my things

After I saw the light
I packed my things
The light gave me life
Helped me see more clearly
And the children went to sleep
And the car was towed away
And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day

I saw a light
Getting smaller in the distance
And I said goodbye",2006,sad
If I Fall,Amber Pacific,"This is for the ones who believe their lives won't change
Hoping that someday things will mend and be the same
This is for the ones who have lost it all when all that's left to gain
Is a simple reminder that the things that were blind to slip away...

How can I say...
Say I'll be okay...

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

Now that the lines been broken
I'm too afraid to just look back
The pages have left an empty space 
You were all I had
Why does it have to be this way
These things they'll never change
Still I'm left with knowing, content and happy, this is all I need...

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on...",2005,sad
Tell Me Why,Cold,"I could see her fall from grace
Like a movie star too old to change her life
With a bottle by her hand
Every night she went away
I would pray for someone else to change her life
If she wouldn't change for me

Tell me why. Please tell me why. You stole my life

Tired of hearing the same old song
Everytime you came back frozen deep inside
Was it my love that you feared
I was a misfit all the way
Never there to help me grow and change my life
Then you smiled and walked away

Tell me why
Please tell me why
You stole my life
Tell me why

All the little things she said to me
Were broken thoughts and tainted dreams
If she can't take these memories
It doesn't change a thing
Every little word she said to me
That broke my heart and stayed with me
I wish that she could hear me scream
She never changed a thing

Tell me why
Please tell me why
You stole my life... life
Please tell me why

This can't go on!",2005,sad
Never Born,Guano Apes,"Love is like a shelter
brings me through the storm
Life is full of anger
maybe I'm dead again now
maybe there's life in me
so much stronger than the world gives it to me
here's the deal, leave it or not
what a surprise, your baby's unborn

Nothing else is deeper
Nothing else is good
Noone cares about the blood in you

I see you through that all
I feel you through the wall
Save my child and I save...

I in me and you are here now
Hold it, save it, never let me down again

I don't feel the darkness
don't feel anything
pressure's lost and pressure's good in me
don't move and don't hide secrets
play hard, don't play alone
move the soul without your own control

I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box),Doug Stone,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Girl I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back from Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Space Bound,Eminem,"We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is ""evol""
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova... and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

You Would Have Loved This,Tarja,"The winter left her blanket

A soft and gentle coverlet of white
Unfolded in the shadows of the dawn
It Sparked in the early morning light
You would have loved this
You would have loved this
This was your favorite time of day
The greenery is laid across the mantle
And ornaments are hanging on the tree
And cradled in the windowsill's a candle
A beacon in the night
to call you back to me
You would have loved this
You always loved this
I know you loved this time of year
And though I understand
One day again I'll see you
I long to touch your hand,
hear your voice, feel you

And the oceans are on fire
When the darkness overpowers light
And the angels muted choir
I will hide here in the meadows

Alexandra Leaving,Leonard Cohen,"Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Itâs not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked â
Do not choose a cowardâs explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving

Take This Waltz,Leonard Cohen,"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears? 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!"" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is",1988,sad

Waiting for the Miracle,Leonard Cohen,"Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb: 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.",1992,sad
Avalanche,Leonard Cohen,"Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul; 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold; 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind; 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed; 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor; 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.",1971,sad
The Traitor,Leonard Cohen,"Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere"" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan"" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face",1979,sad

And late at night
All dolled up like Christ
I walk the water
Between the piers

Singing
Oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

For we all know the baby has expired
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
And no precious liar or well-wisher
Can return the love that was stolen

So oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Can you see the light
At the end of the dark passageway?
Take me with you towards the light
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Hear me, I'm whispering in your ear

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time

Teachers,Leonard Cohen,"I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord? 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost? 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect? 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you? 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess? 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done? 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done?",1967,sad
Speed Trials,Elliott Smith,"He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials all over the place",1997,sad
Ballad of Big Nothing,Elliott Smith,"Throwing candy out to the crowd, dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley, having had enough of it all

Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you

All spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger

You can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you
Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to though it doesn't mean a thing
Big nothing",1997,sad
Master Song,Leonard Cohen,"I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread? 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread?",1967,sad
Crown of Love,Arcade Fire,"They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it 
I carved your name across my eyelids 
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because the spark is not within me. 

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The only thing that you keep changin' is your name
My love keeps growin' still the same 
Just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me 
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because your hands are not upon me. 

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The pains of love
And they keep growin', 
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
It's not within me.
It's not within me.
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say!

Winter,The Dodos,"I know if I'll make it through this winter without you by my side
I waited for you so long while I traveled far and wide
Convinced myself there's no one better, so how could I deny
Your love, it's like a thorn into my side

My friends they understand me better but don't whisper goodnight
I want a lover and a sister, but we know that's not right
You used to listen to my music, I always wondered why
I wish I could pretend you make me try

I want the days to come, I want these sleepless nights to end
I lie here thinking how I lost you to all your stupid friends
You made me feel so foolish for the twenty-second time
Your love might be the last time that I try

Don't know if I'll make it through this winter without you on my own
I waited here for you forever, I can't believe you'd go
I may not have the answers, but I'd rather never know
Your love was such a heavy, heavy blow

Goodnight my love, you seemed so nice 'til I knew you better
Now I can tell you're always thinking twice about what might be better
On the outside, there's no conscience, you're a victim of your cautiousness
You don't try, you just lie there hoping that someone will come to make it right",2008,sad

To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

Said the music was great for dancing

It never made me happy before
And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

So they can see it all and you're so
Occupied with what other persons are
Occupied with, and vice versa

A fraction of the sum
Yeah, you've become, yeah, you have become
A fraction of the sum, the middle and the front

Then tomorrow, tomorrow
They took your life apart and called you failure's art
They were wrong though, they won't know
'Til tomorrow

Tried to go to where it led
But it didn't lead to anything

Love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
Love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
Love is the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thornbush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh

Love is a scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
Love's a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
Love is the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's mane",2002,sad

it will work out one way.""

my arms, my legs, have grown too tired.
And could you be inspired?
No, I'm just tired.

And on a swing you push me hard,
so I'll come back to where you are.
And you know I'm never far.
No decisions, nothing hard.

And I knew that it would rain tonight,
I'll take the bus or the next flight.
I won't give up on what feels right.

If you see these tears filling my eyes,
it's just the wind that makes me cry.
If you could feel this pain inside,
it's from the drinks we drank last night.
It's from the drinks we drank last night.  

And the shadow of our past,
projects on clouds of dust and gas.
Wounds where my eyes will rest,
the silhouette of loneliness.  

If you see these tears filling my eyes,

If you could feel this pain inside,

Maybe I got a problem

Light of a rainy day
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak 
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair

There in your car where I said those things
Now I see love
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Now I see love
There on your side of my empty bed",2002,sad

Mother, I lost it all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother, forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother, forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain

Mother, don't worry. I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother, don't worry. She's got a garden we're planting together
Mother, remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws,
And you cried 'til the morning.

It lies beneath a shade of blue 
It struck me so violently 
When I looked at you 

But others pass, the never pause, 
To feel that magic in your hand 
To me you're like a wild rose 
They never understand why 

I cried for you 
When the sky cried for you 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter 
But this life was not for you 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper 

I'll cross the sea for a different world, 
With your treasure, a secret for me to hold 

In many years they may forget 
This love of ours or that we met, 
They may not know 
how much you meant to me. 

I cried for you 
And the sky cried for you, 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter. 
But this life was not for you, 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper 

Without you now I see, 
How fragile the world can be 
And I know you've gone away 
But in my heart you'll always stay. 

I cried for you 
And the sky cried for you, 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter. 
But this life was not for you,

Where Do The Children Play?,Cat Stevens,"Well I think it's fine, building Jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas
And you make them long, and you make them tough
But they just go on and on, and it seems you can't get off

Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air
Will you keep on building higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?",1970,sad
Stay,Alison Krauss,"Where have you been,
My long lost friend?
It's good to see you again.
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye.
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace.
Can't you hear it calling?
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.

Love's taken you far
Away from my heart,
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine,
A vision that's faded through time?
But you sailed away,
A fine summer's day,
Cause you heard it calling,
A new day dawning,
You were longing to find.

There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay

50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,"""The problem is all inside your head""
She said to me
""The answer is easy if you
Take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle
To be free
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover""

She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning
Won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself
At the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover""

She said, ""It grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again""
I said, ""I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""

She said, ""Why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light""

And I realized she probably was right

Goodbye to Love,Carpenters,"I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love
has passed me by
And all I know of love
is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it.

So I've made my mind up I must live
my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love.

There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories

And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for.

All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my
only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can.

What lies in the future
is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune
as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that
I've been wrong
But for now this is my song.

And it's goodbye to love

I'll say goodbye to love.",1972,sad
If You Go Away,Scott Walker,"If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird's song

If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees
And worship the wind

Then if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world
To stop turning, turning
'til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you?
Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
'til the next hello

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
Though the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow
Of your shadow
If it might have kept me
By your side",1969,sad
Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,Roberta Flack,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",1971,sad
Saturday Sun,Nick Drake,"Saturday sun
Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Saturday sun
Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday's sun
Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by",1969,sad

I Hung My Head,Johnny Cash,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practise my aim

My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind.
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find.""

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Upon a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'd ride together
To Kingdom come
I prayed for God's mercy
For soon I'd be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head",2002,sad

The Good That Won't Come Out,Rilo Kiley,"Let's get together and talk about the modern age
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets just talking shit
About how we're all so upset about the dissapearing ground
As we watch it melt

It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them, standing here on this frozen lake

I do this thing where i think i'm real sick
But i won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stand real still in a real small place
As they chartup your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies i hide behind
It's such a big mistake, lying here in your warm embrace

Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again
I think i'll go out and embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say i choose sadness, that it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right

Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

It's all of the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
It's such a big mistake, standing here on this frozen lake
It's all the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust

Get Big,Okkervil River,"Once we get to the end of this song, 
then it will begin again.
So you said in our bed. 
I was watching light slip through blinds to find your skin. 

""So take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been.
Live your lost weekend,I know you've wanted it. Get big, little kid. 

And I can't say why each day doesn't quite fit the space we saved for it.""
But if that space now demands that you throw up both your hands and call it quits... 

""Take your midnight trip. I know you've dreamed of it. 
Walk your sunset strip, because I think you've needed it to get big, little kid. 

But just remember that our love only got this good
because of the younger days that you'd like to outstrip. 
So drink your cup down to the dregs and leave that club on shaking legs
with another guy, but remember: I'm not him. 

Take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been. 
Live your lost weekend, I know you've wanted it. 
Get big, little kid. 

And once we get to the end of this song, then another will begin.",2005,sad
The Night Starts Here,Stars,"The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear

The pleasure part, the afterthought, the missing stone in the graveyard
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to become a man
The dust at dawn is rained upon, attaches itself to everyone
No one is spared, no one is clean
It travels places you've never been or seen before

The night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea, and shout out ""Please come back to me""
You name your child after your fear, and tell them ""I have brought you here""

The scary part, the aftershock, the moment it takes to fall apart
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to destroy a man
The ecstasy, the being free, the big black cloud over you and me
And after that, the upwards fall, and were we angels after all?
I don't know, I don't know...

The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea, and shout out ""Please come back to me""
You name your child after your fear, and tell them ""I have brought you here""

The night starts here...",2007,sad
Song for Sharon,Joni Mitchell,"I went to Staten Island.
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars...
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, ""Have children!""
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want right now
Is...find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by",1976,sad
The Golden Age,Beck,"Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead

These days I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when it's day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're OK

These days I barely get by
I don't even try",2002,sad
Nobody's Fault But My Own,Beck,"Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang
And let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew
It could be so sweet
Who could ever be so cruel,
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
That it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights
The way for you
When the road is full of nails,
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues
Are full of heartless tales
That drain on you
Who would ever notice you
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

Nobody's fault But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

Where are you going
I have a hiding place
When spring marches in

Father says bow your head like the good book says
Well I think the good book is missing some pages
Gonna lay down

And when my hand touches myself
I can finally rest my head
And when they say take of his body
I think I'll take from mine instead

Daredevil,Fiona Apple,"I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot
Not so with the warmer lot
And all I want is a confidant
To help me laugh it off

And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Say I'm an airplane
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing
And I use them to give me lip
Hip hip for the lift
Hip hip for the drag
I want them all in my bag
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Seek me out
Look at, look at, look at, look at me
I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up
Give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you
And never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
Skirt in my skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone",2012,sad
Kenji,Fort Minor,"My father came from Japan in 1905
He was 15 when he immigrated from Japan
He worked until he was able to buy respect and build a store

Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream,
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means,
Close your eyes, just picture the scene,
As I paint it for you, it was World War II,
When this man named Kenji woke up,
Ken was not a soldier,
He was just a man with a family who owned a store in LA,
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did,
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids,
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran,
He moved to LA from Japan,
They called him 'Immigrant,'
In Japanese, he'd say he was called ""Issei,""
That meant 'First Generation In The United States,'
When everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs,
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack,
And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat,
His world went black 'cause,
Right there; front page news,
Three weeks before 1942,
""Pearl Harbour's Been Bombed And The Japs Are Comin',""
Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin',
Ken knew what it would lead to,
Just like he guessed, the President said,
""The evil Japanese in our home country will be locked away,""
They gave Ken, a couple of days,
To get his whole life packed in two bags,
Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes,
Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in,
So two trash bags is all they gave them,
When the kids asked mom ""Where are we goin'?""
Nobody even knew what to say to them,
Ken didn't wanna lie, he said ""The US is lookin' for spies,
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar,
Where a lot of Japanese people are,""
Stop it don't look at the gunmen,
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',
If you gonna run or not,
'Cause if you run then you might get shot,
Other than that try not to think about it,
Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded,
Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.

As soon as war broke out
The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and
""You have to come""
""All the Japanese have to go""
They took Mr. Ni
People didn't understand
Why did they have to take him?
Because he's an innocent laborer

So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them,
Every day, every night look down at them,
From watch towers up on the wall,
Ken couldn't really hate them at all;
They were just doin' their job and,
He wasn't gonna make any problems,
He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that,
He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made,
But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved,
Prisoners of war in their own damn country,
What for?
Time passed in the prison town,
He wondered if they would live it down, if and when they were free,
The only way out was joinin' the army,
And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on,
And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb,
That 15 kilotonne blast, put an end to the war pretty fast,
Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick,
Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife,
But, when they got back to their home,
What they saw made them feel so alone,
These people had trashed every room,
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors,
Written on the walls and the floor,
""Japs not welcome anymore.""
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside,
He, looked at his wife without words to say,
She looked back at him wiping tears away,
And, said ""Someday we'll be OK, someday,""
Now the names have been changed, but the story's true,
My family was locked up back in '42,
My family was there it was dark and damp,
And they called it an internment camp

When we first got back from camp... uh
It was... pretty... pretty bad

I, I remember my husband said
""Are we gonna stay 'til last?""
Then my husband died before they close the camp.",2005,sad

Sprout and the Bean,Joanna Newsom,"I slept all day
I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved

That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string

And you can ask the counselor
And you can ask the king
And I'll say the same thing
And it's a funny thing

Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?

And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams
Of lead

When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
In the dirt of the day

And danger, danger drawing near them was a white coat
And danger, danger drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water, water running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter of the talking of the tadpoles

Who know the outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?",2004,sad
Monkey & Bear,Joanna Newsom,"Down in the green hay
Where Monkey and Bear usually lay
They woke from a stable-boy's cry

Said, ""Someone come quick
The horses got loose, got grass-sick
They'll founder, Fain, they'll die""

What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?
By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey?
It is, stay by the gate you are given
And remain in your place, for your season
And had the overfed dead but listened
To the high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom

""Did you hear that, Bear?""
Said Monkey, ""We'll get out of here, fair and square
They left the gate open wide
So, my bride, here is my hand, where is your paw?
Try and understand my plan, Ursula
My heart is a furnace full of love that's just, and earnest
Now, you know that we must unlearn this
Allegiance to a life of service
And no longer answer to that heartless
Hay-monger, nor be his accomplice
The charlatan, with artless hustling
But Ursula, we've got to eat something
And earn our keep, while still within
The borders of the land that man has girded
All double-bolted and tightfisted
Until we reach the open country
A-steeped in milk and honey
Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me?
Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?
My love, I swear by the air I breathe
Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth

But for now, just dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon will you dance, my darling?
The hills are groaning with excess
Like a table ceaselessly being set
My darling we will get there yet""

They trooped past the guards
Past the coops, and the fields, and the farmyards
All night, till finally
The space they gained grew
Much farther than the stone that bear threw
To mark where they'd stop for tea

But, ""Walk a little faster, don't look backwards
Your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture
And the blackbirds hear tea whistling and rise and clap
Their applause caws the kettle black
And we can't have none of that
Move along, Bear, there, there, that's that""

Though cast in plaster
Our Ursula's heart beat faster
Than Monkey's ever will

But still, they have got to pay the bills
Hadn't they? That is what the monkey'd say
So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur
Or a kite, jerking tight at its tether
In her dun-brown gown of fur
And her jerkin of swansdown and leather
Bear would sway on her hindlegs
The organ would grind dregs of song for the pleasure
Of the children who'd shriek
Throwing coins at her feet then recoiling in terror

Sing, ""Dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon, will you dance, my darling?
You keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill
Where you'll ever-after eat your fill
Oh my darling, dear mine, if you dance
Dance darling and I'll love you still""

Deep in the night shone a weak and miserly light where the monkey shouldered his lamp
Someone had told him the bear'd been wandering a fair piece away from where they were camped
Someone had told him the bear had been sneaking away to the seaside caverns, to bathe
And the thought troubled the monkey for he was afraid of spelunking down in those caves
Also afraid what the village people would say if they saw the bear in that state
Lolling and splashing obscenely well, it seemed irrational, really washing that face
Washing that matted and flea-bit pelt in some sea-spit-shine, old kelp dripping with brine
But Monkey just laughed, and he muttered, ""When she comes back, Ursula will be bursting with pride
Till I jump up saying, 'You've been rolling in muck,' saying, 'You smell of garbage and grime'""

But far out, far out
By now, by now
Far out, by now, Bear ploughed
'Cause she would not drown

First the outside-legs of the bear up and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters
Then the outside-arms of the bear fell off, as easy as if sloughed from boiled tomatoes
Lowered in a genteel curtsy, bear shed the mantle of her diluvian shoulders
And, with a sigh, she allowed the burden of belly to drop, like an apron full of boulders
If you could hold up her threadbare coat to the light, where it's worn translucent in places
You'd see spots where, almost every night of the year, Bear had been mending, suspending that baseness
Now her coat drags through the water, bagging, with a life's-worth of hunger, limitless minnows
In the magnetic embrace, balletic and glacial, of Bear's insatiable shadow

Left there, left there
When Bear left bear
Left there, left there
When Bear stepped clear of Bear

Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth",2006,sad
Sawdust & Diamonds,Joanna Newsom,"From the top of the flight of the wide white stairs
Through the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?
There's a bell in my ears, there's a wide white roar
Drop a bell down the stairs, hear it fall forever more
Hear it fall forever more

Drop a bell off of the dock
Blot it out in the sea
Drowning mute as a rock
And sounding mutiny

There's a light in the wings hits this system of strings from the side while they swing, see the wires, the wires, the wires
And the articulation in our elbows and knees makes us buckle and we couple in endless increase as the audience admires
And the little white dove made with love, made with love made with glue and a glove and some pliers
Swings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark, settle down, settle down my desire

And the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremor
Though no longer bereft, how I shook and I couldn't remember
And then the furthermost shake, drove a murdering stake in and cleft me right down through my center
And I shouldn't say so but I know that it was then or never

Push me back into a tree
Bind my buttons with salt
And fill my long ears with bees
Braying, ""Please, please, please
Oh you ought not, no you ought not""

And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings cut from cardboard and old magazines makes me warble and rise like a sparrow
And in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood, a cord or two, which you chop and you stack in your barrow
And it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood streaked with soot, heavy booted, and wild-eyed
As I crash through the rafters and the ropes and the pulleys trail after and the holiest belfry burns sky high

And then a slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision
While somewhere with your pliers and glue, you make your first incision
And in a moment of almost unbearable vision, doubled over with the hunger of lions
""Hold me close,"" cooed the dove, who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamonds

I wanted to say, ""Why the long face?""
Sparrow perch and play songs of long face
Burro buck and bray songs of long face
Sing, ""I will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long face
And though it may be madness, I will take to the grave your precious long face
And though our bones they may break and our souls separate, why the long face? 
And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil, why the long face?""

And in the trough of the waves
Which are pawing like dogs
Pitch we, pale-faced and grave
As I write in my log

Then I hear a noise from the hull
Seven days out to sea
And it is the damnable bell
And it tolls, well I believe, that it tolls
It tolls for me and it tolls for me

And though my wrists and my waist seem so easy to break still my dear I'd have walked you to the edge of the water
And they will recognize all the lines of your face in the face of the daughter, of the daughter, of my daughter
And darling we will be fine but what was yours and mine appears to me a sandcastle that the gibbering wave takes
But if it's all just the same then will you say my name? Say my name in the morning so that I know when the wave breaks

I wasn't born of a whistle or milked from a thistle at twilight
No, I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright
So enough of this terror we deserve to know light and grow evermore lighter and lighter
You would have seen me through but I could not undo that desire

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh desire, oh

Desire, desire
Desire, desire

Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences and open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
Before it's too late.",2002,sad
Don't Love You,TV on the Radio,"Oh simple girl
Oh foolish man
Trying to bend these lovers rules
Into a simple plan 

Oh aching bones on sleepless bed
They toss and turn and roll away
From words unsaid

It's just that all that you were
Was all I could want
Now I can't trust your lover's tongue
Except to tease and taunt

It's been said best by you
Been said best before
But I just want to let you know
I don't love you anymore

Sad wakes alone
Cradling the phone
Knows that sullen silence
Is the meanest way to moan
But all that you were
Was all that I had
And we could not find a simple way
To work that simple plan

Oh aching bones
Oh sleepless bed
Toss, turn and roll
Away from words unsaid
It's been said best by you
Been said best before

But I just want to let you know I don't
Love you anymore

I don't love you anymore",2004,sad

Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre

Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more
Suck your woman down

Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile

Annachie Gordon,Loreena McKennitt,"Harking is bonny and there lives my love
My love lies on him and cannot remove
It cannot remove for all that I have done
And I never will forget my love Annachie
For Annachie Gordon he's bonny and he's bright
He'd entice any woman that e'er, e'er he saw
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
And I never will forget my love Annachie

Down came her father, he's standing at the door
Saying Jeannie you are trying the tricks of a whore
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie
For Annachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands
For the Sultan's lands are broad and his towers they run high
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie.

With Annachie Gordon I beg for my bread
Before I marry Sultan his gold to my head
With gold to my head and straight down to my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
And you who are my parents to church you may me bring
But unto Lord Sultan I'll never bear a son
To a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie.

Jeannie was married and from church was brought home
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
She goes into her chamber and cries all alone.

Come to bed my Jeannie my honey and my sweet
To stile you my mistress it would be so sweet
Be it mistress or Jeannie it's all the same to me
But in your bed Lord Sultan I never will lie
And down came her father, he's spoken with renown
Saying you who are her maidens
Come loosen up her gowns
And she fell down to the floor
And straight down to her knee saying
Father look I'm dying for my love Annachie.

The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
And the day that young Annachie came home on the tide
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
Saying oh you've been so long, you've been so long on the sands
So long on the sands, so long upon the floods
They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead.

You who are her maidens come take me by the hand
And lead me to the chamber where my love she lies in
And he kissed her cold lips till his heart it turned to stone
And he died in the chamber that his love she lies in.",1989,sad
Natural Anthem,The Postal Service,"I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing

It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day

I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places I have taken from real life
So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right...",2003,sad

Shatter,Liz Phair,"I know that I don't always realize
How sleazy it is messing with these guys
But something about just being with you
Slapped me right in the face, nearly broke me in two
It's a mark I've taken heart
And I know I will carry it with me for a long, long time

I don't know if I could drive a car
Fast enough to get to where you are
Or wild enough not to miss the boat completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe
You know, just maybe

I don't know if I could fly a plane
Well enough to tail spin out your name
Or high enough to lose control completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe

I'm sinking in quicksand tonight

And I shine across the sky
'Til morning, then you color me in

Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line

The Dumbing Down Of Love,Frou Frou,"Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love

Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without
Without love

No no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
Cause no-one's receiving
This tunnel vision
Is turning out all wrong

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love
Without love
Without love

Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

The Bagman's Gambit,The Decemberists,"On the lam from the law 
On the steps of the capitol 
You shot a plainclothes cop on the ten o'clock 
And I saw momentarily 
They flashed a photograph, it couldn't be you 
You'd been abused so horribly 
But you were there in some anonymous room 
And I recall that fall 
I was working for the government 
And in a bathroom stall off the National Mall 
How we kissed so sweetly 
How could I refuse a favor or two 
For a trist in the greenery 
I gave you documents and microfilm, too 

And from my ten floor tenement 
Where once our bodies lay 
How I long to hear you say 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

It was late one night 
I was awoken by the telephone 
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line 
Purloined in Petrograd 
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay 
So I paid off a bureaucrat 
To convince your captors they're to secret you away 

And at the gate of the embassy 
Our hands met through the bars 
As your whisper stilled my heart 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

And I dreamt one night 
You were there in fours 
Head held high 
In uniform 

It was ten years on 
When you resurfaced in a motorcar 
With the wave of an arm 
You were there and gone",2005,sad

God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell apart.

Weary blues from waitin'

These blues have got me cryin'

As they go strollin' by

Just sit back and listen

Somewhere In My Broken Heart,Billy Dean,"You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly, go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken heart

Girl, I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I Can't Unlove You,Kenny Rogers,"Postcards and letters

Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favour of making sweet sixteen...

Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray

Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do

What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love
You were thinkin' that our love was gonna stray
Oh tell me

Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you baby
The way that I do, now baby
Where, where will you go, where will you go
And tell me who is gonna love
I wanna know who is gonna love
I need to know who's gonna love
Who's gonna love, who, who, who, oh

Where, where will you go, baby
Who's gonna love you baby, tell me
Who's gonna care for you baby
Who's gonna be there for you baby
Who's gonna love you like you need to be loved
Oh where will you go, baby
And who's gonna love you like I do

Oh I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
Like I do",1989,sad
Missing You,Case,"Standing here looking out my window
My nights are long and my days are cold
Cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now
But I can't let go

[1] - Every day I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that 
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

[2] - Like a cold Summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

Driving 'round thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
Cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
Cause my loneliness got the best of me
And my heart's so weak

Whatsername,Green Day,"Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what's his face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
From so long ago

(Go, go, go, go)

And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time.",2004,sad
Ribbons Undone,Tori Amos,"She's a girl
Rising from a shell
Running to spring
It is her time it is her time
Watch her run with ribbons undone

She's a rose in a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right there will be time
To chase the sun with ribbons undone

She runs like a fire does
Just picking up daises
Comes in for a landing
A pure flash of lightening
Past alice blue blossoms
You follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you
Arms filled with lavender

Yes my little pony is growing up fast
She corrects me and says
""You mean a thoroughbred""
A look in her eyes says the battle's beginning
From school she comes home and cries
I don't want to grow up Mom at last not tonight

You're a girl
Rising from a shell
Running through spring
With summer's hand in reach now
It is your time
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
It is your time yes my angel
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone

Run run darlin'
Ribbons undone",2005,sad
Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?

Did you stand there in shock
At the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger
In fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?

Did you burst out with pride
For the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died
Just doin' what they do?

Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?

Did you feel guilty
'Cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother
And tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?

Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

Without You Here,Goo Goo Dolls,"Your love's a gathered storm I chased across the sky
A moment in your arms became the reason why
And you're still the only light that fills the emptiness
The only one I need until my dying breath
And I would give you everything just to
Feel your open arms
And I'm not sure I believe anything I feel

And now, now that you're near
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

And I'm trying to believe
In things that I don't know
The turning of the world
The color of your soul
That love could kill the pain
Truth is never vain
It turns strangers into lovers
And enemies to brothers
Just say you understand
I never had this planned

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here
Without you here
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

My head lies to my heart 
And my heart it still believes
It seems the ones who love us are the ones
That we deceive
But you're changing everything
You're changing everything in me

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here",2006,sad
Break It Up,Scooter,"Where in the world, where in the world
Where in the world did I get this hurt
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me bad, call me wrong
Call me anything but your own
I don't mind, I don't mind

I don't care if you leave me
I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this
I don't mind

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

So where in the world, where in the world,
Where in the world can I hide this hurt,
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind

If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brand new ride
But babe please don't tell me so

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

Break it up, just break it up",1996,sad
The Forgotten,Green Day,"Where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Theyâre lost inside your memory
Youâre dragging on, your heartâs been broken
As we all go down in history

Where in the world did the time go?
Itâs where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Well donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen

I donât feel strange, itâs more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I canât quite put my finger on it
But itâs like a child that was left behind

So where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love",2012,sad
If You're Reading This,Tim McGraw,"If you're reading this
My Mommas sitting there
Looks like I only got a one way ticket over here
Sure wish I
Could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

[Chorus:]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my Momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
Half way around the world
I wonât be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stands up for the innocent and the weak

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

[Chorus]

If you're reading this
Thereâs going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find some one else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

All at Once,Whitney Houston,"All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

[Chorus:]
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Living Proof,Ricky Van Shelton,"She hangs up the phone and her heart starts to pound
Someone just told her an old friend's in town
And a million old feelings come rushing in
Start tearing to pieces what it took years to mend

She's living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
She just can't forget it, Lord knows, she's tried
She's living proof, true love never dies

You answer the door and I say, ""Hello""
If you don't want to see me, just tell me, I'll go
But I can't love without you, it's only pretend
There's no love like you're sweet love, can we try it again?

We're living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
I just can't forget you, Lord knows, I've tried
We're living proof, true love never dies
Yes, we're living proof, true love never dies",1988,sad
She Don't Want the World,3 Doors Down,"The open wound she hides
She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
And that's ok, she don't want the world

All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
And that's ok, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

Those words he never spoke
Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more
But it's ok, she don't want the world

Softly in her sleep
Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear
She just smiles, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
And it's ok, she don't want the world",2008,sad
How Could an Angel Break My Heart,Toni Braxton,"I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine

I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name

I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Oh, my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Feel The Silence,Goo Goo Dolls,"You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry
All you remember now
Is what you feel

The truth remains
In midnight conversations
I asked for this moment
But you turned away

Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain

And you remain
A promise unfulfilled
I ask you for more
But you push me away

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside us
Looking for something more to say
I don't know where I'm going
Only know where I been
But you move through my soul like a hurricane wind
We've been so lost for so long
I don't know how to get back again 
And we're drowning in the water
That flows under this bridge
When you're fighting the current
You forget how to live
And I wanted to reach you but I don't know where to begin
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled until today

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain
And if we feel the silence
Leaving this all behind us
When it's gone what will you say

How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on

You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry",2006,sad
Little Miss Perfect,Sugababes,"Iâm the most responsible girl that I know
Never late, always on time for the show
Ask anyone around me

I try to tell the truth every chance that I get

And when it came to love
I thought I gave it the best I had, yeah

Everyday spent without you
It gets harder to act like Iâm okay
If I could take back the things that I said
If I could un-break all that we had
Iâd put all the pieces back together again

The Way Down,The White Tie Affair,"You know reactions speak louder than words.
Thought we were past that,
forget what you heard.

Better to shut out the light,
than to find yourself at home all alone

Problems won't disappear.

Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Everything was perfect,
till the train went right off the rail.

Love Hurts,Jon B.,"Sometimes love can feel
Like the closest thing to heaven
Sometimes love can feel
Like you've been run over by a car
Yes it can it's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you dowm on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
Cause love can sure hurt sometimes

Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
Love hurts and it don't

Some people will tell you
It's the best thing for the heart
Yes they will what they fail to tell you
It can tear your life apart
But you know it's as sweet as a summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing, everybody sing

Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't

When you know that you're alive
Cause you feel so much pain
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to say
Then you know, yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't

Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't

I'll even make believe I don't love you.

Lose my mind, go insane, turn my face to the pourin' rain
There's nothin' I wouldn't do if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

If there's no way to make it work
I'll find a way to hide the hurt 
I'll do my best to do what's best for you.

I'll just take your memory and disappear quietly
Quit acting like a fool if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

Ohh if it takes good-bye to make you happy

[English translation:]

Oh woah...

A girl like you is such a confusing set
Of questions and answers
So I shut my mouth
I bury love inside the farewell
Outside the window, the forgotten rain and wind blows
In the wee hours of the night
I hear familiar songs from the radio
It's perfect for thinking about you
There are two empty cups of coffee
In this place without you, I fight with loneliness

I walk alone on the streets
I go to the cafe I used to go a lot, I go watch a movie

I lock even myself in the memories, how about you?
This weather, this temperature
This passing wind, will I remember it?
A person to be forgotten
Like a passing by black and white film
I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
(I draw you with a pencil, I erase you
With an eraser that is the falling rain)
Oh woah...
(I draw you out again today
Will I be able to erase you?)

A bright red umbrella
Wet and drenched clothes and sneakers
I turn off and turn on the boiler
Whatever I do, it doesn't dry
Is that how I feel or is it not?
A confusing set of questions and answers

On a rainy day, I fell for you
We used to love
Each other so much
It didn't seem like we had to do this
So my heart hurts so much (heart hurts)
(From the beginning, I held you in the left side
Of my heart and you thickly remain)
Now you remain as a broken fragment
That's deeply engraved inside
You pull me in
I think I lied when I said I could live without you
I throw away my feelings
But I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Dear sky, please help me
Please stop this rain
So that I can forget her, oh no

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
Outside the window
The sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days, I miss you and our kiss
Oh woah...
Outside the window, the sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days
I always run into you",P:  ,sad
Pictures of Me,Elliott Smith,"Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease

Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op TV
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong

You go walking by
Here come another guy
Jailer who sells
Personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?

Change Is Hard,She & Him,"I'm all out of luck
But what else 
Could I be?
I know he's yours
And he'll never belong
To me again

I did him wrong
So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know

So I'll keep my head down
If you keep it quiet from now on
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Than the bells of new love

So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know

California,Copeland,"I miss the way you sing low
So I can't hear your voice over
The radio in my car
But you knew every word they sang
You know just the right thing to say when the
Distance rips us farther and farther and farther away
I'll see you soon

If you're coming back this way again
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

Maybe I fell too fast
Maybe I pushed you away
Now you're gone and I'm afraid
That you're never coming back this way again

I'll see you soon
If you'll come back here
I'll see you soon
Just say that you want to see me too

Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

Monopolize all my time
I won't say a thing at all
I won't say a word no

So come back from California
Come back from California",2003,sad
Welcome Home,Radical Face,"Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun, and the days blur into one
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done

Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much, but we've made the most
Welcome home

Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost

Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I've come home

All my nightmares escape my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs
I feel your thumbs
Press into my skin again",2007,sad
Comforting Sounds,Mew,"I don't feel alright
In spite of these comforting sounds
You make
I don't feel alright
Because you make promises
That you break
Into your house
Why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
It's hard to make sense
Feels as if I'm sensing you
Through a lens
If someone else comes
I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude
And probably you know
All the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it
Honestly
Back when we were kids
We would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are
Messing up
Nobody has gained or
Accomplished anything",2000,sad
I'll Wait for You,Joe Nichols,"The snow in Montana was three feet high
Lady at the counter said,
""There ain't no flights""
So he called her on the telephone,
He said I'll rent a car
And I'll drive home.

She said,
I'll wait for you like I did last year
At Christmas time with you family here,
And your truck broke down
Out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped
Till you got home,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

Now he's on his cell phone
In a Coupe deVille
Talking to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breaking
Cause she's there alone
Her heart is aching
Cause she wants him home

She says i'll wait for you
Like in '68 when our child was due
I said It will have to wait
Until his dad gets here,
And stands by my side,
Remember dear our son's first cry.
Soh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

He didn't stop all day
To eat a bite,
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said she's in a better place
She said to give you this note,
Just in case.

And it said I'll wait for you
At heaven's gate,
Oh I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell St. Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

P.S. I love you too
Sweatheart I'll wait for you...",2005,sad
He Stopped Loving Her Today,George Jones,"He said, ""I'll love you till I die""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy, now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today",1980,sad
Years,Barbara Mandrell,"Faded photographs
The feelings all come back
Even now sometimes
You feel so near
And I still see your face
Like it was yesterday
It's strange how the days turned into years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

Nighttime gently falls
Another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

After all these years...",1979,sad
Days Like These,Janis Ian,"On days like these
When the rain won't fall
And the sky is so dry
That even birds can't call
I can feel your tears
Disappearing in the air
Carried on the breeze
On days like these

It's years like these
That make a young man old
Bend his back against the promises
That life should hold
They can make him wise
They can drive him to his knees
Nothing comes for free
On days like these

But you can't reap what you don't sow
And you can't plant in fallow ground
So let us fill this empty earth with hope
Until the rains come down

In lives like these
Where every moment counts
I add up all the things
That I can live without
When the one thing left
Is the blessing of my dreams
I can make my peace
With days like these

I can make my peace
With days like these",2000,sad

Emptiness
Is a place you're in

Till It Happens to You,Corinne Bailey Rae,"I know what I said
Was heat of the moment
But theres a little truth in between the words we've spoken
Its a little late now to fix the heart thats broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going
Cause I don't know
No I don't know anymore

It used to feel like heaven
Used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But you wont believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same now when I'm with you
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen
When our love was new
Oooh love I'm a fool to believe in you
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
Anymore

It used to feel like heaven
It used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth
Until their hearts broken
Don't you dare tell them
What you think to do
Till they get over

From experience
When you get older
I just wish that someone would have told me
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you",2006,sad

The Point of It All,Amanda Palmer,"Oh, what a noble, distinguished collection of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again: no we'll wait, no we promise, we'll wait
June makes these excellent sewing machines out of common industrial waste
She spends a few days at a time on the couch but she says
She wears shades, she wears shades

But no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
And you're learning that just 'cause they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call...

They made the comment in jest
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all

Maybe a week in the tropics would help to remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on a deck with a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple weeks later we came back and you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet
Eyes fixed to the place where the dryer had been

Oh, but no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
Why on earth would I keep you propped up in here when you so love the fall...?

The pattern's laid out on the bed
With dozens of colors of thread
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point in the end

But it's better to waste your day watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
Than to put yourself in it and turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
But while you were sleeping some men came around
Said they had some dimensions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about but they sure made a mess of your face

But still, no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for playing along
You're almost human, even now

And just 'cause they call themselves experts
It doesn't mean sweet fuck all...
They've got the permanent press
Homes with a stable address

And they've got excitement
And life by the fistful
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all",2008,sad
Perfect Enemy,t.A.T.u.,"Why should I welcome
Your domination

The Rose,Bette Midler,"Some say, ""Love. It is a river
That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love. It is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""
Some say, ""Love. It is a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love. It is a flower
And you its only seed""

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",ound,sad
Born in the USA,Bruce Springsteen,"Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering up

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Hiring man says ""Son if it was up to me""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said ""Son, don't you understand""

I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone

He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),Phil Collins,"How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take

Take a look at me now",,sad

What About Now,Daughtry,"Shadows fill an empty heart

But are not saying
Can we see beyond the stars
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

Don't look down,
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you.
Don't look down, you'll fall down,
You'll become their sacrifice.

And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you",2006,sad
They Won't Go When I Go,George Michael,"No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when i go

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him i'll bide
Because they won't go when i go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
They won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
They won't go when i go

Since my soul conceived 
All that i believe
The kingdom i will see
'Cause they won't go when i go

When i go
Where i'll go
No one can keep me
From my destiny",1990,sad
The Love Thieves,Depeche Mode,"Oh the tears that you weep

Who fall at your feet

The sharks and the sailors

Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirits shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as adam is eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers",1997,sad

That I've got nothing to give

I wish I could say
That I've got no regrets
But saying that would be one more
To pile on my desk
I wish I could say I've clung to time like gold
But as you said goodbye I almost died
I almost died

I take it back all of it
Those names I called myself
The heroes of my childhood
Like hardbacks on the shelf
I take it back those promises
I made to everyone
I'm falling through a ribbon last
Before I'd learn to run

A Good Year For The Roses,George Jones,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them 
While you packed

And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes 
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses 

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you  
Haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say
We haven't said
While a million thoughts
Go runnin' through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin'
Goes unheard

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'

I can save for someone else

The Night,Morphine,"You're the night, Lilah
A little girl lost in the woods
You're a folktale
The unexplainable
You're a bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own

It's too dark to see the landmarks
And I don't want your good luck charms
I hope you're waiting for me 
Across your carpet of stars
You're the night, Lilah
You're everything that we can't see
Lilah
You're the possibility

You're the bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
And I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own

Unknown the unlit world of old
You're the sounds I've never heard before
Off the map where the wild things grow
Another world outside my door
Here I stand I'm all alone
Driving down the pitch black road
Lilah you're my only home
And I can't make it on my own

You're a bedtime story 
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own",2000,sad
Sunshower,Chris Cornell,"Dark as roses, fine as sand
Feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish
Or recollections of better days gone by

But its all right
When you're caught in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Its all right
Though your gardens grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights

But its all right
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Oh its all right
Though your gardens gray
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sunshower

I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower
And its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today
Its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today.........",1999,sad
Bless The Weather,John Martyn,"Time after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I loved it
Just to watch it cry

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home

Wave after wave, I watched it
Just to watch it turn
Day after day, I cooled it
Just to watch it burn

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away

Pain after pain I stood in
Just to see how it would feel
Rain after rain I stood in
Just to make it real

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the day you go away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away

Time after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I held it
Just to watch it cry

Curse the storm that takes you away",1971,sad
Why Should I Care,Diana Krall,"Was there something more I could have done? 
Or was I not meant to be the one? 
Where's the life I thought we would share? 
And should I care? 

And will someone else get more of you? 
Will she go to sleep more sure of you? 
Will she wake up knowing you're still there? 
And why should I care? 

There's always one to turn and walk away 
And one who just wants to stay 
But who said that love is always fair? 
And why should I care? 

Should I leave you alone here in the dark? 
Holding my broken heart 
While a promise still hangs in the air 
Why should I care?",1999,sad
Tuesday Morning,Melissa Etheridge,"10:03 on a Tuesday morning 
in the fall of an American dream 
a man is doing what he knows is right 
on flight 93 

Loved his mom and he loved his dad 
loved his home and he loved his man 
but on that bloody Tuesday morning 
he died and American 

[chorus]
Now you cannot change this 
You can't erase this 
You can't pretend this is not the truth 

Even though he could not marry 
Or teach your children in our schools 
Because who he wants to love 
Is breaking your God's rules 

He stood up on a Tuesday Morning 
In the terror he was brave 
And he made his choice and without a doubt 
A hundred lives he must have saved

And the things you might take for granted 
Your inalienable rights 
Some might choose to deny him 
Even though he gave his life 

Can you live with yourself in the land of the free 
And make him less of a hero than the other three 
Well it might begin to change ya 
In a field in Pennsylvania

Hear the bell now as it tolls 
Wake up America 
It's Tuesday Morning 
Let's roll

You're Stronger Than Me,Patsy Cline,"If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still, fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be.
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.

Plenty,Sarah McLachlan,"I looked into your eyes
they told me plenty
I already knew
you never felt a thing
so soon forgotten all that you do
in more than words I
tried to tell you
the more I tried I failed
I would not let myself believe
that you might stray
and I would stand by you
no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you
until my dying day
until my dying day
I used to think my life
was often empty
a lonely space to fill
you hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
you made my world stand still
and in that stillness
there was a freedom
I never felt before
I would not let myself believe
that you might stray
and I would stand by you
no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you
until my dying day

The Difficult Kind,Sheryl Crow,"I think I was wrong
I think you were right
That all my angry words
Will keep me up at night
And through the old screen door
I still hear you say
Oh, Honey won't you stop
Treating me that way

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed

Tell it to me slow
Tell me with your eyes
If anyone should know
How to let it slide
I swear I can see you
Coming up the drive
And there ain't nothing like regret
To remind you you're alive

I crossed the canyon a thousand times
But never noticed what was mine
What you'll remember of me tonight
Well, it almost makes me cry
Yeah, it almost makes me cry

Oh ballbreaking moon and ridiculing stars
The older I get, the closer you are
Don't you have somewhere that you need to be
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see the change in me
If you could only see
What love has made of me
But I'll forever be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see
No you won't see
The good in me
But babe I've changed
Cause babe I've changed",1998,sad
She's A Jar,Wilco,"She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A hand full of wheel
And a day off
And a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk, I sing
Wont you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil

Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her",1998,sad
Late Goodbye,Poets of the Fall,"In our headlights, staring, bleak, beer cans, deer's eyes
On the asphalt underneath, our crushed plans and my lies
Lonely street signs, powerlines, they keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath hot upon my cheek, and we crossed, that line
You made me strong when I was feeling weak, and we crossed, that one time
Screaming stop signs, staring wild eyes, keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair, and then we're playing hide and seek
I can't breathe easy here, less our trail's gone cold behind us
Till' in the john mirror you stare at yourself grown old and weak

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye...",2005,sad
What You're Made Of,Lucie Silvas,"Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
'Cause I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

[Chorus]
If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're not in love this time...but it's alright.

I hear you talking, but your words don't mean a thing
I doubt you ever put your heart into anything
It's not much to ask for, to get back what I put in
But I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

What's your definition of the one?
What do you really want him to become?
No matter what I sacrifice it's still never enough.

Just like I predicted
I will sink before I swim
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in

Paper Aeroplane,KT Tunstall,"Well this stone that I have swallowed
Isn't going down so well
And this road that I have followed
Is leading me to Hell

And you said it didn't matter
But I think you're a liar

And the earth will turn below you

Oh something has to give

And when I build you a steeple
You say it's incomplete
'Cause you need the whole cathedral
To satisfy the need

Straight into the hand that chokes you

That never seems to land
Flying blind through anything

Lay my head, boys
I'm will call my home

Well I see that
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold

Because I learned to be alone
And anywhere
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home",1985,sad

Jacob's Dream,Alison Krauss,"In the spring of 1856 with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
200 men had gathered there to comb the mountain side
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and erie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

a thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry

Man, she was laid out on a long white table

Wherever she might be
Lord, you can search this whole wide world over
But she ain't never going to find another lover man like me

I want a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Nothing to Lose,Billy Talent,"Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know
Put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone
So I became lifeless
Just like my telephone

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I'd have to check my mirror
To see if I'm still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches
Alone in the bathroom

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

Teachers said ""it's just a phase""
When I grow up my children
Will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
Who'd know it put me underground at seventeen

The Long Goodbye,Ronan Keating,"I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free (so they say)

But those words ain't pulling me through
Cos I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill

Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?

You're gonna make me cry

All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
and I know without a doubt
We turned it inside out
And if we walked away
would make more sense (only self defense)
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep riding on a carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere?

Mad About You,Sting,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient sighs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you",1991,sad

Do What I Gotta Do,Ralph Tresvant,"(So, so hard, girl)

I'm 'bout to do this
Oh, I guess it's one of those things
A man just has to do
But I promise
It'll work out for the better, baby
Trust me

I've been feeling lately
Like being single or just alone
To get into myself

Love ain't easy
Making me crazy
Games that we play
Sometimes the rules have to change

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty
So what am I gonna do?

I guess I'll do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

I gotta

Any good relationships starts
Inside of a happy man
I think she will understand

If I tell her straight up
Then she can only respect me
Even if we don't agree

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty, baby
So what am I gonna do?

Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry

Penny to My Name,Eva Cassidy,"Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
And I was only nineteen when I had my third baby 
And sometimes I think maybe I should've left here long ago 

Travellers are stopping by, check their oil and their p.s.i. 
Gas up and away to fly, moving down the line 
But this beat-up truck & worn out shoes always give me the blues 
Billy sucking down the booze nearly every night 

[Chorus]
I never seen the city lights 
How they must shine so bright 
Not like this country night 
The sky's black as coal 
And this gas-station mountain home 
Not a thing to call my own 
How I wish I was alone 
With a penny to my name 

Strangers say this mountain here is beautiful beyond compare 
But it's just a dumb old mountain; I see it every day 
If I could see sunset skies over fields of green or ocean-tides, 
City skyline in the night, I'll be dancing till the dawn 

[Chorus]

Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
Maybe Bill & I someday will find a chance to get away 
Until then it's here I'll stay wishing on a star

Heartless,Kris Allen,"In the night

Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me

And you can't make it right

Power Trip Ballad,Maria Mena,"The way in which I fear is solely a reflection of you,
The devastating child of the power trip you forced me through.
But how could he leave you,
Could he fuck that whore he left you for?
Get revenge;

And by all means ask your nine year old daughter to choose between you,
Don't stay friends.
Now let her in on how he's the devil,
He's just been falsely portrayed.
But force her to go stay at his house once a week
'Cause you wanna get laid,

Ask me why he scares me,
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.

Your girl's in the bathroom washing her hands again,
Why doesn't she eat?
Her father left us
What about me?
I can't rest,
I can't sleep.

Mommy loves you
I'm just tired of you and your brother's shit.
And you know I didn't mean to hit you,
But you were asking for it.

Ask me why she scares me.
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

Torch,Soft Cell,"I'm lost again and I'm on the run
Looking for love in a sad song
With your avenger eyes and your catlike ways I can hold you
You are a fool for me to be cruel
I'm leaning on this bar listening to you sing
And your sad song rings in my ears and I start to cry

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I hear the saxophone and it tears my soul
And we're feeling old, feeling so cold
She is the torch and she is the theme
She could be a dream but - oh boy - is she real
Try to avoid her eyes, to avoid her words
They will hit you with all that you feel

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

See her eyes they are bright tonight.
See the stars coming out tonight.
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight. 

See my eyes they are bright tonight.
See my hands reaching out tonight.
Hear my words they are dynamite
See how they light your way tonight

See her eyes they are bright tonight
See her eyes they are bright tonight
See how they light your way tonight",1981,sad
One More Sad Song,The All-American Rejects,"One boy, one girl, two hearts, their world
Time goes by, secrets rise
One more, sad song, tears shed, she's gone

I Don't Know You Anymore,Savage Garden,"I would like to visit you for a while
Get away and out of this city
Maybe I shouldn't have called but someone had to be the first to break
We can go sit on your back porch
Relax
Talk about anything
It don't matter
I'll be courageous if you can pretend that you've forgiven me

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

Always such relief from the winter freeze
The snow was more lonely than cold
If you know what I mean
Everyone's got an agenda, don't stop
Keep that chin up, you'll be all right

Are you still the same?
Has your opinion changed?
'Cause I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from these sentences
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I know I let you down
Again and again
I know I never really treated you right
I've paid the price
I'm still paying for it every day

So maybe I shouldn't have called
Was it too soon to tell?
Oh what the hell
It doesn't really matter
How do you redefine something that never really had a name?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name

How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,Patty Loveless,"Through the back window of a '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slippin' further away
I kept on waving 'till I couldn't see her
And through my tears, I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed, he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling, we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up Mama, she said, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

Sitting with Mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes, and then squeezed my hand
She said, I have to go now, my time here is over
And with her final word, she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

You Broke My Heart,William Fitzsimmons,"Fourteen years is all you made it
Till forgiveness was frustrated
I was sorry you missed Christmas
Do you think that you'll still miss us

I was angry when you left us
And it showed up on my mattress
And I told myself it's better
If we only talk in letters

You broke my heart
You broke my heart

Did you think about my mother
When you shared the same bed cover
Did you wonder if it changed her
When your sons became your stranger

When will you admit your lonely
Since we split apart the family
All the pictures are updated
All of us are separated

You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
I don't feel it anymore
You broke my heart
I don't feel it anymore

You broke my ...",2006,sad
Startin' With Me,Jake Owen,"I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline

I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck when she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell

And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed when the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma died

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see

Ohh, I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

Dance With My Father,Luther Vandross,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved?
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",2003,sad
The Fallen One,HammerFall,"I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Silently, whispering my name

So many things that I wanted to say
Forever left untold
I still remember the tears that you shed
Over someone else

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

There is a light down at memory lane
Slowly fading away
Still holding on to the dreams torn apart
I will follow my heart

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

Still on my own, chasing the sun
Of a time long ago
The shade in my heart, tearing apart
Everything that I long for

I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Whispering my name

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one",1998,sad
A Little Rain,Tom Waits,"The Ice Man's mule is parked
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the buthcer's son
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one

They're dancing on the roof
And the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it wurth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one

The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride

She was 15 years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was, ""I love you mom.""

And a little rain
Never hurt no one
And a little rain
Never hurt no one",1992,sad
Song to Sing When I'm Lonely,John Frusciante,"A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again

Holding tight to dreams that never end
I'll be you
I do
I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyones reason
Everything dying and leaving
Out with these faults and you make me a baby
Faking an movement by no ones seeing it
No one always find peace flung
No one chooses to beat my pride down
Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up
Sunlight to fate accumalates
Loving pain to be clung to
By lumimous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong
And true to us
Out of place in my own time
Drowning thinkin that I'm dry
Holding on to facts that'll never be proven
Faking an action cus no one's looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feeling nothing when my life's flashing before my eyes
You should've threw me down
Is the content so much",2003,sad
You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,Brad Paisley,"In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive

Oh, my granddad's dad walked down 
Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth
Of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
'Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I'll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive

Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west 
Of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling 
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking

Ruby and Carlos,James McMurtry,"Ruby said you're gettin' us in a world of hurt
â¨And down below the Mason Dumb Ass line the food gets worse
â¨I can't go back to Tennesseeâ¨That NASCAR country's not for meâ¨
Go on if you think you must

â¨â¨Carlos packed his drums up in the dark of night
â¨Ruby standing just outside the front porch light
â¨Chain-smoking Camel straights
The sky off to the East got grey
â¨And he rolled off in a cloud of dustâ¨â¨

The grey colt nickered at the gateâ¨
She said ""you're right it's gettin' lateâ¨
You and me got work to doâ¨
We can't be burning daylight too""â¨
She took down the long lead ropeâ¨
And stayed off that slippery slope

â¨â¨The aspen trees were turning gold up topâ¨
The talk was buzzing round the beauty shopâ¨
""Wasn't he barely half her age?""
â¨""Well that's just how they do nowadays
â¨We should all a'been so lucky""â¨â¨

By spring she'd had the run of all the freeborn men
â¨Ruby turned fifty in a sheep camp tent
â¨Her body still could rock all nightâ¨
But her heart was closed and locked up tight
â¨Potato fields all muddy and brownâ¨
The gossip long since quieted downâ¨â¨

After one more Coggins test
â¨Pouring coffee for the county vet

â¨â¨Pictures on the ice box doorâ¨
Of Carlos in the first Gulf Warâ¨
Black eyed, brown and youthful faceâ¨
Smiling back from a Saudi baseâ¨â¨

Then Carlos on the big bay mareâ¨
Heavier now and longer haired
â¨Looking past the saddle shed
â¨From way on back inside his headâ¨â¨

The old vet said one day Rube
â¨That colt will break an egg in you
Now and then one comes along
â¨You just can't ride then he went on homeâ¨â¨

The storm door didn't catch
â¨It blew back hardâ¨As she struck a match
â¨But she cupped it just in time
â¨Then she sent that ash tray flyingâ¨â¨(

[Chorus:]
Holding back the floodâ¨
Just don't do no goodâ¨
You can't unclench your teeth
To howl the way you should
â¨So you curl your lips aroundâ¨
The taste of tears and a hollow sound
That no one owns but you
â¨No one owns but youâ¨â¨

Carlos took the road gig and he saw it through
â¨He rode the tour bus while the singer flew
â¨Managed out of Music Rowâ¨
Carlos never saw the studioâ¨
Session guys had that all sewn upâ¨â¨

He looks out the window as it starts to sleet
â¨Layinâ on a friend's couch on Nevada Street
â¨Lately he's been staying high
Sick all winter and they don't know why
â¨They don't know why or they just won't sayâ¨
They don't talk much down at the VAâ¨â¨

Ruby's in his thoughts sometimes
â¨What thoughts can get out past the wine
â¨He feels her fingers on his brow
â¨And right then he misses how
â¨She looked in that grey morning light
â¨She never shaved like they all do now
He sees it all behind his eyes
â¨His hands go searching but they come up dryâ¨â¨

Halfway in that waking dreamâ¨
Carlos lets the land line ringâ¨â¨

He'd never have guessed it was Ruby calling
â¨A pin in her hip from the grey colt falling
â¨Figure eights in a lazy lope
â¨Stumbled on that slippery slope

Do You Dream at All,Tilly and the Wall,"When you crawl into bed

Darker still
Such dead slumber will get you nowhere in the end
So do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you wish someone was there to rock you to sleep?
And hold you near?
Well, that won't be me.
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do

No Joy in Mudville,Death Cab for Cutie,"Last night I dreamt that I was you. I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude.
Such a pose I could simply not hold through days in a northern town that I had once called a home.
Your studies of fringe New York streets... I was reading the pavement in every work you would speak.
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
Buying drinks for the poets upstate, this southern corrupting towed you down the interstate,
And they all said that you were the king of gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would speak.
This town simply cannot compete so I'm packing my Bullets and Silverstones
And heading east to a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
If I could have (had) my way this year would bridge '66 (again?)
Trust fund hipsters were casing the room chock full of amphetamines.
The overturned kick drum book set the pace with incomparable cool.
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you...",2000,sad
The Right Man,Christina Aguilera,"So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give his bride away

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man

Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child

My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own

Here I go

Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew a right man

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance

Ohh

Well I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance

And one day my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man",2006,sad
Crying in the Chapel,Elvis Presley,"You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees

Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way",1967,sad
Songs About Rain,Gary Allan,"Well this town has closed down way too early, 
And there's nothing to do,
So I'm driving around in circles, 
And I'm thinking about you,
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way,
And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain
Now there's all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car, 
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like,

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain,
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not,
Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I'll never know what could have been,
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in,
If their gonna keep on playing me songs like, 

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain,
All these songs about rain,

Saving All My Love for You,Whitney Houston,"A few stolen moments is all that we share 
You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone 
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own 
But each time I try I just break down and cry 
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
So I'm saving all my love for you 

You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy 

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door 

'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you 

No other woman is gonna love you more 
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright

they still fail to capture you 
as mere words can only do 
how do i explain that smile 
and how it turns my world around 
keeping my feet on the ground

i'll be right there if you call 
you're my greatest love of all

I Stopped to Fill My Car Up,Stereophonics,"I stopped to fill my car up
The car felt good that day
I didn't know where I was going
But it felt good for a change
A five and a pocket full of silver
I paid the lady no change
And then it started to piss down
I started driving again

And then I looked up
And looked in the mirror behind me

A man round forty in the back seat
Must have stepped in when I was empty
So why's he sat there just waiting
Likely to smash my face in

He had a bag full of money
He said just drive me away
I didn't know where I was going
Yet it felt good to be strange

And still I look up
And look in the mirror behind me

Curiosity is over
He stepped down from the car
He pulled a gun out from his jacket
Said I was going to die

It gives me so much satisfaction
To watch you beg and cry
Well I just made up this story
To get your attention makes me smile

I never looked up or looked
In the mirror behind me",1999,sad
Do I Have to Say the Words,Bryan Adams,"Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire

Want you here by my side
Come to me, darling, rescue me

When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free, darling, rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me, please, darling, rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see? Darling, rescue me

Song for You,Alexi Murdoch,"So today I wrote a song for you 
Cause a day can get so long 
And I know it's hard to make it through 
When you say there's something wrong 

So I'm trying to put it right 
Cause I want to love you with my heart 
All this trying has made me tired 
And I don't know even where to start 

Maybe that's a start 

For you know it's a simple game 
That you play filling up your head with rain 
And you know you've been hiding from your pain 
In the way, in the way you say your name 

And I see you 
Hiding your face in your hands 
Flying so you won't land 
You think no one understands 
No one understands 

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head 
And your throat is aching but you swear 
No one hurts you, nothing could be sad 
Anyway you're not here enough to care 

And you're so tired you don't sleep at night 
As your heart is trying to mend 
You keep it quiet but you think you might 
Disappear before the end 

And it's strange how you cannot find 
Any strength to even try 
To find a voice to speak your mind 
When you do, all you wanna do is cry 

Well maybe you should cry 

And I see you hiding your face in your hands 
Talking 'bout far-away lands 
You think no one understands 
Listen to my hands 

And all of this life 
Moves around you 
For all that you claim 
You're standing still 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
I will move with you",2006,sad
The Curse,Josh Ritter,"He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight
With the girl in the doorway
What beautiful lines and how full of life
After thousands of years what a face to wake up to
He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm
She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping
And under miles of stone, the dried fig of his heart
Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating

She carries him home in a beautiful boat
He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage
He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed
And one day his lips answer her in her own language
The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh
The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches
She asks, âAre you cursed?â He says, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes

In New York he is laid in a glass covered case
He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him
But each night she comes round and the two wander down
The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum
Often he stops to rest but then less and less
Then it's her that looks tired staying up asking questions
He learns how to read from the papers that she
Is writing about him and he makes corrections

It's his face on her book more and more come to look
Families from Iowa, upper west siders
Then one day it's too much he decides to get up
And as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her
She's using a cane and her face looks too pale
But she's happy to see him as they walk he supports her
She asks, âAre you cursed?â but his answer's obscured
In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters

Such reanimation the two tour the nation
He gets out of limos he meets other women
He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum
But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him
She stops going out she just lies there in bed
In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking
Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold
And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating

Long ago on the ship she asked, âWhy pyramids?â
He said, âThink of them as an immense invitationâ
She asked, âAre you cursed?â He said, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question",2010,sad

When the day comes and all of them bums
Will reveal enchanting persons

A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, 
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. 
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight",2003,sad
Simple Together,Alanis Morissette,"You've been my golden best friend
Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition
This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things
I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken
You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you I knew god's face was handsome
With you I saw final expansion
This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything
I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe
I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together
But I was sadly mistaken

Once again 
I'm losing my mind 
But I have to carry on 
We were meant to be together 
Forever as one 

So this is where the story ends 
Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes 
You told me we could still be friends 
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies 

So here

The Saddest Song,The Ataris,"Only two more days, until your birthday
Yesterday was mine
You'll be turning five
I know what it's like, growing up without your father in your life
So I pretend, I'm doing all I can
And I hope someday you'll find it in your heart

To understand
Why I'm not around
And forgive me for not being in your life

I remember waiting
For you to come
Remember waiting
For you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
I remember waiting
For you to come
Remember waiting
For you to call
Waiting there to find nothing at all

maybe someday
you really get to know me
not just the letters read to you
I pray I get the chance
To make it up to you
We got a lot of catching up to do

So I pretend, I'm doing all I can
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart

To understand
Why I'm not around
And forgive me for not being in your life

Redemption,Frank Turner,"I was walking home to my house through the snow from the station
When the Springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question
Oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption?
Or are we all merely biding our time down to lonely conclusions?
Darling let me take your hand as I talk you through this
How loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis
Lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on tape hiss
With my feelings laid clear on the ceiling
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can do this

Well I tried so hard to not turn into my father
But if I only ever skip all his choices will I ever choose better?
Oh the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener
So I left you alone in a restaurant in London in winter
You deserved better

Adam Trask is on my back and in my ears
And the sound comes clear and brings the awful truth
That I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary
Today should have been our anniversary
And I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can't escape
I only ever have myself to blame

These failures shift and shake me in the night
Like a fever I can't break try as I might
Wake me darling I need you take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine, and mine alone

So if each of us is made up of a tally of mistakes and successes
Then my hour in that restaurant makes my score less than impressive
But each can be redeemed with the courage with which he confesses
So darling I miss you, your music and your musk and your kisses
I don't think I can do this",2011,sad

I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,

A Distance There Is,Theatre of Tragedy,"Come in out of the rain thou sayest
But thou ne'er step'st aside
And I'm trapp'd, I'm trapp'd
A distance there is

None, save me and the bodkin
Pitter-patter on the roof
Behold! - 'tis not the rain
Thence me it has to be
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocence
Yet thou let'st thy lass into peril
Thou let'st me be parched

My heart is of frailty
My pale skin is hued damask

When thou thy tears hast hidden
""Come back!"", thou sayest
There I soon am to be
But how am I to run when my bones, my heart
Thou hast me bereaft
But run thou sayest
I run...

And there and then I behold that a time will come
When I again dead will be
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay
I leave...

Oh, I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk

In my mind in which is this event
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?

After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world
All the beautiful moments shared, deliberately push'd aside

Hardened smell of grow
Trees all alive and will cry 
Washed by songs entirely

Don't send him to the water afraid

Only Hope,Mandy Moore,"[Written by Switchfoot]

There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But you sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands
And pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing
And laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give you my destiny
I'm giving you all of me
I want your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope",,sad

Why did I leave maybe we'll never know
But I'm a man now broken on the ground
I'm in need and I think that it shows

All this time we're going nowhere and we know it

All the lights are leading to where you're going
I'm not far behind

Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie

Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try",1989,sad

Sally's Pigeons,Cyndi Lauper,"When I was eight I had a friend
With a pirate smile
Make believe and play pretend
We were innocent and wild
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate
Running down my alleyway
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly

We loved to watch them dive and soar 
Circle in the sky
Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly

I had a fool's confidence
That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities

My heart began to
Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
In tears she told me she was late
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...

On the dresser sits a frame 
With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly
She never saw those birds again
And me, I can't remember when 
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry
I close my eyes
And Sally's pigeons fly...",1993,sad
I Look to You,Whitney Houston,"As I lay me down,
Heaven hear me now.
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all.

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun.
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

About to lose my breath,
There's no more fighting left,
Sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door.

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret.
And I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you.
I look to you.
And when all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

My levees are broken
My walls have come
Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling.
Defeat is calling.
I need you to set me free.

Take me far away from the battle.
I need you.
Shine on me.

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.",2009,sad
She Thinks His Name Was John,Reba McEntire,"She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then

But there is one she can't put her fingers on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams

And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John",1994,sad
What I'd Say,Gary Allan,"Talkin' to the mirror, whispering your name
It's just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say

There's time I've been so angry
I could put my fist right through the wall
And then there's times I've come so close
To givin' you a call
I love you and I hate you
All at the same time
Then I pray you'll come back to me
Before I lose my mind

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell

I Can Still Make Cheyenne,George Strait,"Her telephone rang  'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.

He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

[Chorus:]
She said, ""Don't bother comin' home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

[Chorus]

She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind",1996,sad
Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes,George Jones,"You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your, radio heros
Like the outlaw that walks through Jesse's dream

No, there will never be another
Red-headed stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darling 
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes

[Chorus:]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes

God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And old Go Cat Go still echoes through the years

You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell when hew sings I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

[Chorus:]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you

Too Cold At Home,Mark Chesnutt,"Well, it sure feels good to come in here
And just pull up a seat
A frosty mug of a cool one
Helps to beat the heat
These old dog days of summer
Lord, I'll be glad when they're gone
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Well, that baseball game on TV
Takes me back to when I was a kid
We proudly wore those uniforms
Just like the Dodgers did
Yea!, we won a few and and we lost a few
And for me it still goes on
Too hot to fish, and too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Well, I only planned on one or two
I might stay for three
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner
Keeps smilin' back at me
It's so easy not to care
'Bout what's right or what's wrong
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Whatever Happened to Me,Merle Haggard,"It gets longer in between each time you call

I once played a big part in your world 
Think back and I know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world
Oh but whatever happened to me

I made up my own excuses for so long
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me

Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me",1967,sad

If A Broken Heart Could Kill,Keith Whitley,"Oh it's choking me to death

It happens when I think of you
And I think it always will
Every day that passes by
It's just one more way to die
Lord knows I'd be gone now on
If a broken heart could kill

Why didn't you just take a gun
And shoot me where I stood?
And put an end to this misery
For good

But you know, I'm still alive
And somehow I will survive
But Lord knows I'd be cold and still
If a broken heart could kill

Why didn't you just take a gun
And shoot me where I stood?

I would

My wife left and didn't say why
She laid all our bills on the desk in the hall
Oh, these days I barely get by

Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose and I cried
Oh, my boss says come winter we'll all be laid off

making love into memories

Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,"[Verse 1]
I said I left my baby girl a message 
Sayin' I won't be coming home

That I'd rather leave than to cheat 
If she gives me some time

And we've been together since our teenage years 
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time 
To be alone

But when you love someone 
You just don't treat them bad 
Oh, how I feel so sad

I think about my life and what matters to me the most

But in time your heart will heal 
I'm not saying I'm gone

Without you

Go and try to look inside his heart
You can find your own mistakes
Try to hide them thinking he can't talk

Tell me why it leaves you cold

Castle Down,Emilie Autumn,"You can see that I swim
Through the sea of painful
You have watched as I pulled 
Myself from the floor

And you were there when I 
Built my tower like pebbles in the rain
Trying to balance all that I had left
With what I didn't have any more

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

You seem so devoted
Your love is unconditional
You were self-promoted
I never asked you

You were my everything
My apparitional faith
Where are you when I am
Screaming to my god what am I coming to

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

If I had another place to go
Would you break me, is it that you know
I have no choice but to rebuild again
I'm tied so hard I can't remember when 
I last walked free upon these feet of mine

But I'll draw the line
There will come a time
When I am stronger
Your words won't hurt any longer

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left
'Til there is nothing, nothing left
'Til there is nothing left

Would you tear my castle down
Would you tear my castle down
Would you tear my castle down",2003,sad
A Kiss Without Commitment,Daniel Bedingfield,"[Bonus Track]

A kiss without commitment's
Like a flower without the rain
It only leads to pain
And it fills my heart with emptiness
Your touch without commitment's
Like a calm before the storm
The tears are starting to form in my eyes

When I kissed you I was curious
The child that I was
I never realised I would love you so
And in the magic of the moment
I was swept to the side
And I saw your heart
So small and tender

Physical is fine
But I cannot avoid the pain
I'm like an express train
As I surge towards the mountains
I am certain as I'm livin'
I cannot do this again
We're much too greater friends
To play games

When I kissed you it was
Everything I dreamed it would be
But I never dreamed it would mean so much to me
And our friendship is too valuable to carelessly lose
So today I choose
To really love you

Jessica your heart is
Like a newly budding rose
Expanding as she grows
Your petals have been bruised
But you have so much love to give
And it's so beautiful to see
You're beautiful to me, my friend

And when I kissed you
I believed it wouldn't get in the way
I want to stay your friend and have it fine
And I'm hoping that our God can make great things of our lives
His love survives
The greatest struggles

Jessica your gate is open, nothing in your way
A friend you'll always stay to me
Whatever else we're gonna be
A friend
You'll always stay to me",2004,sad
Lost In You,Sugarcult,"Six days went by
Trying to forget her face
It was you and I
We were to young for these games

And all the pictures that I kept
And all the things I should have said
It was you and I
But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six weeks went by
Still pretending that I'm fine
It was you and I
Holding back what's on our minds

And all the things I should have said
And all the letters left unsent
It was you and I
But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six months went by
I almost forgot your face
Till they played that song tonight
The one we used to hate

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Lost in you(I'm lost in you)
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you(I'm lost in you)
And I can't find myself again

Everything I Build,The Stills,"The tide is high
I've never been so low
You got room to grow

You can never look up
You can't ever look down
You get kicked around

But I built it with sand
And I built it with rock
I built it with all of the
Things that I'm not
And I watch from the hill
As it burns to the ground
I can still see the smoke 
From my train out of town

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

I close my eyes
Scared of what I saw
Are you mad at all?
Been an open book
Been a slamming door
Apple of the trojan war

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

Drink a little bit
Dance a little bit
Take a chance 
I lose it all
I have no remorse no regrets
When I'm hanging from 
This seventeenth floor

The tide is high
Never been so low
You got room to grow

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down",2008,sad
Alone In Brewster Bay,Minnie Riperton,"Watch the fire die
See the snowflakes fly
Hear the geese out honking on the bay
Feel the fire's flame
Do they sigh your name
Think of you, my love, so far away

Once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you
I feel a lot like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'

Then I close my eyes
And I search the skies
For a sign of you thinking of me
Then I feel you here
You are oh so near
In my mind I find you next to me

Cause once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you
I feel a lot like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'

Watch the fire die
See the snowflakes fly
Hear the geese out honking on the bay
Thinking of you, my love, alone in Brewster Bay",1975,sad
Mother and Father,Madonna,"There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother
It was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

[Bridge:]

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

[Chorus:]

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother
It was nice

[bridge]
[chorus]

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

I gotta give it up
[repeat twice]

[chorus]

Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
[repeat five times]

I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up

I gotta give it up

Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,Patty Smyth,"Now, I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love, it just ain't enough",1992,sad
Trying My Best to Love You,Jenny Lewis,"Our love is sweeter than strings
Our love is thicker than angel wings

But still sometimes I can't believe you're real

Our love is simple
Our love is crystal

But still sometimes you cannot help yourself
You step outside and hear bells ringing
For you, for you

Trying my best to love you
Trying my best to love you

It's so hard on us baby

I want you back my baby
I want you back in my arms

Love Shoulda Brought You Home,Toni Braxton,"Should I even listen
Should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines
Baby
See it doesn't matter
What you say this time
Cause our whole relationship
Is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me

How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of

Love Shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Gotta hand it to ya
Ya had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need

Love Shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe,
I just don't believe
That you'll allways be here

Love Shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side

If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you

There's No Me Without You,Toni Braxton,"There's no me without you

There's no moon without you
There's no Saturday nights without you
There's no walk through the park

How come the skies are all grey
How come my eyes are all red?

Why do I love in despair

Hurts The Most,Monica,"[Verse 1:]
Boy its been a long time,
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothings changed
Since weâve been together
I must admit that Iâm still crazy âbout you
And I can see it in your eyes
That thereâs something you wanna say to me
Cuzz usually right now youâd be holding on to me
But instead youâre telling meâ¦.

That things have changed
Theyâre not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

Is letting go
I just want you to know
That I love you so
And though things are different now
Youâve gone and settled down
I thought for sure youâd always wait for me
Iâll tell you what hurts the most
Is that I shouldâve took the chance
Boy when you come to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought, Iâd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love
And oh how Iâm missin you now

I hate that thereâs someone new
Cominâ in and taking my place
Doin things that we used to do

Never Is a Promise,Fiona Apple,"You'll never see the courage I know
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

But as the scenery grows
I see in different lights
The shades and shadows
Undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch
I see from greater heights
I understand what I am
Still too proud to mention
To you

You'll say you understand
But you don't understand
You'll say you'd never give up
Seeing eye to eye
But never is a promise
And you can't afford to lie

You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown
To you

You'll say don't fear your dreams
It's easier than it seems
You'll say you'd never
Let me fall from hopes so high
But never is a promise
And you can't afford to lie

You'll never live
This life that I live
I'll never live the life
That wakes me in the night

You'll never hear
The message I give
You'll say it looks as though
I might give up this fight

But as the scenery grows
I see in different lights
The shades and shadows
Undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch
I see from greater heights
I realise what I am now
Too smart to mention
To you

You'll say you understand
You'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up
Knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in
You don't know who I am
You'll say I need appeasing
When I start to cry
But never is a promise
And I'll never need a lie",1996,sad

Hey There Delilah,Plain White T's,"Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you

Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

I fake a smile so he won't see",2006,sad
Better Than Me,Hinder,"I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend... I won't think about you when I'm older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Make This Go on Forever,Snow Patrol,"Please don't let this turn into something it's not
I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness [x2]

My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness [x2]",2006,sad
Goodbye Blue Sky,Pink Floyd,"[A child's voice:]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye

Stan,Eminem,"[Dido:]
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?

I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,âshut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you

People Ain't No Good,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,"People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veil

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all

To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good

It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'll stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit baby

Scented and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realise that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Brothers on a Hotel Bed,Death Cab for Cutie,"You may tire of me as our December sun is setting because I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for: both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 

On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still reside. 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea like navy men 
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed

Because I'm not who I used to be",2005,sad

You tell me your life's been way off line

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mysteries seem so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train

Miss Misery,Elliott Smith,"I'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnnie Walker Red
Send the poison rain
Down the drain
To put bad thoughts in my head

With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?

A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong
Hardly ever wrong
I said, ""Man, you're mean.""

You had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I've seen
In a magazine
That you'd left lying around

I don't have you with me
But I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?

I know you'd rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway

Next door the TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy
Of errors, you see
It's about taking a fall

To vanish into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I try to be
But you know me
I come back when you want me to

Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?",,sad
Comfortable,John Mayer,"I just remembered, that time at the market
snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
you looked behind you to smile back at me
crashed into a rack full of magazines
they asked us if we could leave.

Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in

I sleep with this new girl i'm still getting used to
my friends all approve, say she's gonna be good for you
they throw me, high fives

She says the bible is all that she reads
and prefers that I not use profanity
your mouth was, so dirty

Life of the party
and she swears that she's artsy
but you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in
she's perfect, so flawless
or so they say, say

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin'
and poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in
she's perfect, so flawless

when we were Siamese
Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near.

Lay me down, the lie will unfurl

Don't go and lose your face

Lilac Wine,Jeff Buckley,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
and be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because (it) brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here? 
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love? 
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Shed the clothes that become my skin
See the liar that burns within my needing

How I wish I had screamed out loud

All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray

It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain

Hold memory close at hand
Help me understand the years
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell
How I wish I would save my soul

The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence.""",1964,sad

Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.

You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
If you'd only try turning around.

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me,
Threatening the life it belongs to

And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table

My books were all to me
I scribed the words of God
And much of history

Many a year was I
Perched out upon the sea
The waves would wash my tears,
The wind, my memory

I'd hear the ocean breathe
Exhale upon the shore
I knew the tempest's blood
Its wrath I would endure

And so the years went by
Within my rocky cell
With only a mouse or bird
My friend; I loved them well

And so it came to pass
I'd come here to Romani
And many a year it took
Till I arrived here with thee

On dusty roads I walked
And over mountains high
Through rivers running deep
Beneath the endless sky

Beneath these jasmine flowers
Amidst these cypress trees
I give you now my books
And all their mysteries

Now take the hourglass
And turn it on its head
For when the sands are still
'Tis then you'll find me dead

Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,Led Zeppelin,"Babe, baby, baby, I'm Gonna Leave You.
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you.
I'll leave you in the summertime,
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along.

Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe,
Baby, baby, I wanna leave you.
I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble.
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin',
We really got to ramble.

I can hear it callin' me back home!

Babe, oh, babe... I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh, I can hear it callin 'me
I said don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do? Ooooh

Walk Away,Christina Aguilera,"What do you do, when you know something's bad for you and you still can't let it go?

I was naive, your love was like candy
Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely

[Chorus:]
And it hurts my soul cause I can't let go, all these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I've lost control 'cause I
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away...

I should have known that I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke, it was all an illusion
Now I've been lickin' my wounds, but the venom seeps deeper
We both can seduce, but darlin' you hold me prisoner

[Chorus x2:]
Oh I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
I'm about to break and I can't stop this ache, getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve the pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away...

Every time I try to grasp for air, I am smothered in despair it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare, I let out a silent pray
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more

Now what to do, my heart has been bruised, so sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

[Out Chorus:]
It hurts my soul 'cause I can't let go, all these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I lost control
Cause I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need, Oh
I'm about to break, and I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure and I'm fiending for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin right back to the one thing that I need, Oh
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return what did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn I keep goin right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

Butterfly,Weezer,"Yesterday I went outside
With my momma's mason jar
Caught a lovely Butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Everytime I pin down what I think I want
It slips away - the ghost slips away
I smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasies
A life of chasing butterfly 

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Everytime I pin down what I think I want
It slips away - the ghost slips away 

I told you I would return
When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never coming back
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry",1996,sad
Heartattack in a Layby,Porcupine Tree,"I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

(She waits for me. Home waits for me.)

I guess I should go now
She's waiting to make up
To tell me she's sorry
And how much she missed me
I guess I'm just burnt out
I really should slow down
I'm perfectly fine but
I just need to lie down

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together...",2002,sad
Born to Die,Lana Del Rey,"Why?
Who me?
Why?

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates,
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on

I don't know why
Keep making me laugh

Warning Sign,Coldplay,"A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you

Littlest Things,Lily Allen,"Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissin'
And I remember when you started callin' me your missus
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, Tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

I know it's not right, but it seems unfair

Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend

Fade to Black,Metallica,"Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye",1984,sad
Day Old Hate,City and Colour,"So let's face it this was never what you wanted
But I know it's fun to pretend
Now blank stares and empty threats
Are all I have, they're all I have.

So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I'll find you before I drift away

Now you still speak of day old hate
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
And how safe it is to feel safe.

So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I'll find you before I drift away

The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to keep ourselves alive.",2005,sad
Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,John Mayer,"It's not a silly little moment,
It's not the storm before the calm.
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on.

Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms.
Nobody's gonna come and save you,
We pulled too many false alarms.

We're going down,
And you can see it too.
We're going down,
And you know that we're doomed.
My dear,
We're slow dancing in a burning room.

I was the one you always dreamed of,
You were the one I tried to draw.
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw.

I'll make the most of all the sadness,
You'll be a bitch because you can.
You try to hit me just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand.

We're going down,
And you can see it too.
We're going down,
And you know that we're doomed.
My dear,
We're slow dancing in a burning room.

Go cry about it - why don't you?
Go cry about it - why don't you?
Go cry about it - why don't you?

My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room,
Burning room,
Burning room,
Burning room,

Love Hurts,Incubus,"Tonight we drink to youth

But love is now a feat.

Is there a spell that I am under

But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive.
Love sings,
When it transcends the bad things.
Have a heart and try me,

I stand naked and accused

Breathe,Taylor Swift,"I see your face in my mind as I drive away

The Heart Wants What It Wants,Selena Gomez,"You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

More than you'll ever know 

This is our last embrace 
Must I dream and always see your face 
Why can't we overcome this wall 
Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all 

Kiss me, please kiss me 
But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation 
You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time 
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye 

Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,' 
And did you rush to the phone to call 
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind 
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all 
You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know 

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime 
Burning clues into this heart of mine 
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories 
Offer signs that it's over... it's over",1994,sad
At Seventeen,Janis Ian,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen",1975,sad

Travelin' Soldier,Dixie Chicks,"Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth in a cafÃ© there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talking to me?
I'm feeling a little low.""
She said, ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go.""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said, ""I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care.
I got no one to send a letter to.
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart
It might be love and all of the things he was so scared of
He said, ""When it's getting kinda rough over here,
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier.
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile.
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for awhile.""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the Anthem sang
A man said, ""Folks would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead.""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read but nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming 

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy

Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said

then you don't have to do it

You'll be okay, anyway

Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway

Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together

Like the feeling of what he needs

She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother,
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm going to ask her to marry me

Even though she doesn't believe in love,
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut

Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Forgive me, I'm trying to find

I didn't think much of it then

Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

This darkness would turn to light

So why am I ten feet under and upside down
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Because I'm so used to living underneath the surface

Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack

And I swore way too much
But I swear
You didn't care

And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here

Say one last prayer

Stairway to Heaven,Led Zeppelin,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",1971,sad

An ounce of peace is all I want for you. Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me, just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?

The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away!""
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Mad World,Tears for Fears,"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere
Going nowhere

And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson?
Look right through me
Look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad

Silent All These Years,Tori Amos,"Excuse me but can I be you for a while
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
Yeah I can hear that

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know
But nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me
You never shut up
Yeah I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been here
Silent all these years

So you found a girl
Who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
Boy you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you

My scream got lost in a paper cup
Do you think there's a heaven
Where the screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker
Do you think it's enough
To get us there

'Cause what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been here
Silent all these...

Years go by
Will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand
Years go by
If I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds
Raining in my head

Years go by
Will I choke on my tears
'Til finally there is nothing left
One more casualty
You know we're too easy easy easy

Well I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now
But baby don't look up
The sky is falling

Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin' at you
Here take hold of my hand
Yeah I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care

I said sometimes

I hear my voice

Gone Away,My Brightest Diamond,"Far away you've gone, and left me here
So cold without you, so lonely dear
May June July I count the time
Every minute I go takes the smell of your clothes further away

'Cause you've gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

I have saved every piece of paper
Like grocery lists and note cards
To-do lists and race scores
So just in case you change your mind and come back
I've kept everything safe

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

Get me out get me off
Get me out get me off
This is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
That you've left behind

For this is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
To keep me company in my old age

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
Why don't you write to say goodbye?
Goodbye",2006,sad
Guess I'm Doing Fine,Beck,"There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me

I just wade the tides that turned
Till I learn to leave the past behind

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow

Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine",2002,sad

Why,Annie Lennox,"How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Heyâ¦ this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell meâ¦
Why?
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besidesâ¦
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Tell me
Why?

Tell me
Why?

These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tearsâ¦
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent

Cup of Coffee,Garbage,"You told me you don't love me 
Over a cup of coffee 
And I just have to look away 
A million miles between us 
Planets crash into dust 
I just let it fade away 

I'm walking empty streets 
Hoping we might meet 
I see your car parked on the road 
The light on at your window 
I know for sure that you're home 
But I just have to pass on by 

So no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I'm still this obsessed 
I guess I always knew the score 
This is how our story ends 

I smoke your brand of cigarettes 
And pray that you might give me a call 
I lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls 
Hanging round bars at night 
Wishing I had never been born 
And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home 

So no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I still feel like this 
I guess I always knew the score 
This is where our story ends 

You left behind some clothes 
My belly summersaults when I pick them off the floor 
My friends all say they're worried 
I'm looking far too skinny 
I've stopped returning all their calls 

And no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I'm still so obsessed 
I want to ask where I went wrong 
But don't say anything at all 

It took a cup of coffee 
To prove that you don't love me",2001,sad
Society,Eddie Vedder,"It's a mystery to me
We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all, you won't be free

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have, you think you need
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keepin score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
And you can't do that

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

I hope you're not lonely without me 
Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree

Where the Wild Roses Grow,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,"They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day 
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild 
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face 
[Chorus]
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, ""Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"" 
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said: ""Will you give me your loss and your sorrow""
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, ""If I show you the roses, will you follow?"" 
[Chorus]
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt (stood smiling) above me with a rock in his fist 
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, ""All beauty must die""
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth 
[Chorus]",1996,sad
Ultraviolence,Lana Del Rey,"He used to call me DN

He hurt me but it felt like true love

Loving him was never enough

We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on earth
I will do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this, this union
Crying tears of gold, like lemonade

I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever,
I love you forever

You'll Think of Me,Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Stop before you fall
Into the hole that I have dug here.
Rest even as you
Are starting to feel the way I used to.

Just to sound confused.
Don't talk about everyone.

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie-la-lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie-la-lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
OR cut him 'til he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie-la-lie...",1970,sad

It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on",1971,sad
White Horse,Taylor Swift,"Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naÃ¯ve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now",2008,sad
I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,Aerosmith,"I could stay awake just to hear you breathing

Fragile,Sting,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are
How fragile we are how fragile we are",1987,sad
Full of Grace,Sarah McLachlan,"the winter here's cold, and bitter
it's chilled us to the bone
we haven't seen the sun for weeks
too long too far from home
I feel just like I'm sinking
and I claw for solid ground
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
oh darkness I feel like letting go

if all of the strength and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place
I know I can love you much better than this
full of grace
full of grace
my love

so it's better this way, I said
having seen this place before
where everything we say and do
hurts us all the more
its just that we stayed, too long
in the same old sickly skin
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
oh darkness I feel like letting go

if all of the strength
and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place
I know I could love you much better than this

It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cos she didn't fit in there

Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and ...

Floating, bouncing back
And one day....

The Only Exception,Paramore,"When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind.
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it.

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget.
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist.

But darling,
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts.
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone.
Or keep a straight face.

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance.
And up until now I have sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness.

Because none of it was ever worth the risk.

Well you are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.

I've got a tight grip on reality,
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here.
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up.
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh.

You are the only exception. [4x]

I'm reading your note over again,
There's not a word that I comprehend,
Except when you signed it
""I will love you always and forever.""

As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out.

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending.

I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
I am alone
In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak,
And this bottle of beast is taking me home.

Well, as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out.
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out.

Here Today,Paul McCartney,"And If I Say I Really Knew You Well
What Would Your Answer Be.

Ooh- Ooh- Ooh- Here To - Day.

Well Knowing You,
You'd Probably Laugh And Say That We Were Worlds Apart.
If You Were Here Today.
Ooh- Ooh- Ooh- Here To - Day.

But As For Me,
I Still Remember How It Was Before.
And I Am Holding Back The Tears No More.
Ooh- Ooh- Ooh- I Love You, Ooh-

What About The Time We Met,
Well I Suppose That You Could Say That We Were Playing Hard To Get.
Didn't Understand A Thing.
But We Could Always Sing.

What About The Night We Cried,
Because There Wasn't Any Reason Left To Keep It All Inside.
Never Understood A Word.
But You Were Always There With A Smile.

And If I Say I Really Loved You
And Was Glad You Came Along.

If You Were Here Today.

Sad Lisa,Cat Stevens,"She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
She must be hurt very badly
Tell me what's making you sadly?
Open your door, don't hide in the dark
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me
'Cause you know that's how it must be

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
Upon her pain getting deeper
Though my love wants to relieve her
She walks alone from wall to wall
Lost in a hall, she can't hear me
Though I know she likes to be near me

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

She sits in a corner by the door
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her
I'll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her

Candle in the Wind,Elton John,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before

Now at Last,Feist,"Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For have lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winter lonely
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winter lonely
Now at last I know",2004,sad
Into Dust,Mazzy Star,"Still falling
Breathless and on again
Inside today
Beside me today
Around, broken in two
Till your eyes shed
Into dust
Like two strangers
Turning into dust
Till my hand shook
With the weight of fear

I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate

It was you
Breathless and torn
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers
Turning into dust
Turning into dust",1993,sad
Life on Mars?,David Bowie,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Bleeding Love,Leona Lewis,"Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I

Sadness Is a Blessing,Lykke Li,"My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight

Sadness is a blessing

The Winner Takes It All,ABBA,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
It seems plain to me",1980,sad
It Must Have Been Love,Roxette,"(It must have been love but it's over now)

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now

That it doesn't matter

But I know that you'll find another

Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know

And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to

Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it

Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain

She put down in writin' what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.

Well, I've been to London and I been to gay Paris
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of the world full of lies
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.

I was born here and I'll die here against my will
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb

Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer

Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.

He came back the other day, you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time

Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times

She broke down the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time

Hero of War,Rise Against,"He said ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun and you'll even get paid""
I said ""That sounds pretty good""

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looks alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it's a flag that I love

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

Well what would you say, if I said that you could?""",2008,sad
Secret Love Song,Little Mix,"When you hold me in the street
And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this
We got a love that is homeless

Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down
Or would you play it safe and stay?

We got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby

Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

The Trapeze Swinger,Iron & Wine,"Please remember me, happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

In these final hours,
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power;
But you won't.
No, you won't.

I'll close my eyes,
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel

Just give me till then
To give up this fight.

Such a beautiful mess that's breaking my skin

Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

Come back home. You know the place where you used to live,
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,
But now you only stop by every once in a while.

Shit. I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind.
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way.
You can call me if you find that you have something to say.

And I'll tell you: I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career.
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin', and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless.

It seems one thing has been true all along:
You don't really know what you've got 'til it's gone.
I guess I've had it with you and your career.
When you come back I won't be here,
And you can sing it.

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.

Nightswimming,R.E.M.,"Nightswimming deserves a quiet night

The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago,
turned around backwards so the windshield shows.
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still it's so much clearer

I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day

Nightswimming, 
remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
The bright tide forever drawn 
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night",1992,sad

Wish You Were Here,Pink Floyd,"So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.",1975,sad

Love Will Tear Us Apart,Joy Division,"When routine bites hard,
And ambitions are low,
And resentment rides high,
But emotions won't grow,
And we're changing our ways,
Taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry.
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

You cry out in your sleep,
All my failings exposed.
And there's a taste in my mouth,
As desperation takes hold.
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more.

Comes creeping on so haunting every time.

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides.

And hear your voice of treason.
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight.

Trouble,Coldplay,"Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Back to Black,Amy Winehouse,"He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black, black, black, black
I go back to...
I go back to...

Lua,Bright Eyes,"I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone.

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.

And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist.

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.

I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.

And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
It was so simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight",ingl,sad
Black,Pearl Jam,"Hey... oooh...

Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I'm spinning, oh
I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be... yeah...

Uh huh... uh huh... ooh...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?

Sing in Silence,Sonata Arctica,"You were daddy's girl nice and sweet
Never in trouble mommy's honey
Little child who just couldn't see
The pressure from her so called friends
Was simply too much

The monkey slowly climbed on her back
Offering an aid for her pain
Giving love and care
No-one cared, no-one cared...

Fragile like a rose on the snow
Eating all your strength and your money
Walking in the shade day and night
Never letting sunshine in your eyes like before

Cannot shake the monkey off your back
Did I see a spark on your eye
Was it just the last light of hope
That died, hope that died

""Forgive me, Father, my daily sin...""

How can I forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
Haven of Emotion, Mournful Ocean
Heiress of the Evening Sings in silence

""I need to have now, my daily sin...""

For all your life I prayed for time
To show you where the light lies
Now this is the end
One rose for the memory of the innosence...

""I know, my Father, I cannot win...""

Never will forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
How can I erase your pain and aid you
When Death wants to kiss you and you want kiss Him back...",2001,sad
The Needle Has Landed,Neko Case,"Here I am in traffic's slow flow
Where the needle touched down
Carbon planes draw a cage round the air force base
Where the needle touched down
My foot on the brake it's ok to fly low
Over poor Spanaway

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter
The needle's the same that recorded and played
When you left me at the greyhound the year I moved away
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here baby
My baby, baby

So that's why I never come back here
That's why they spit out my name
Your ex's have clawed up the bible
Trying to keep me away
With the sledge of tectonic fever
The needle has landed again
Let it play

And the needle touched down
The needle is landing
And the needle touched down
The needle is landing

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town
From a sharp-toothed freighter

The Jeep Song,The Dresden Dolls,"I've been driving around town 
With my head spinning around
Everywhere i look i see
Your '96 jeep cherokee

You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that ive been through
You'd think i'd hate the sight of you

But with every jeep i see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess its just my stupid luck
That all of boston drives that same black fucking truck

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style...

I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When i wonder if it makes you want to cry 
Every time you see a light blue volvo driving by

So dont tell me that you're off to see the world
I know you wont get very far
Dont call me if you get another girl baby
Just call me if you get another car

The number of them is insane
Every exit's an exboyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and i want to paint it black

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
I can't wait til you trade that fucker in
By then they will have stuck me in the looney bin

It could be him my heart is pounding
Its just no use i'm surrounded
But someday i'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that cherokee straight off this trail of tears",2004,sad

See the same sad faces

That God's got everybody in His hands

Is He listening?

If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next,Manic Street Preachers,"The future teaches you to be alone

Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young and being so vain

Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked La Ramblas
But not with real intent

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this

With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes

Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you've done is good

I may just never see you again, or might as well

Greets the day with hope and comfort too

New York Minute,Don Henley,"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here;
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

You Have Been Loved,George Michael,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world
We've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If i was weak, forgive me
But i was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And i'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove

And heaven help the ones who wait for you

Well i've no daughters, i've no sons
Guess i'm the only one
Living in my life

Take care my love, he said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, he said

You have been loved",1996,sad

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again

And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down

to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify

Makes up her mind
Another fight
Left behind
There goes the fear again, let it go
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify, why?

Take It Easy (Love Nothing),Bright Eyes,"First with your hands and then with your mouth
A downpour of sweat, damp cotton clouds
I was a fool, you were my friend
We made it happen
You took off your clothes, left on the light
You stood there so brave
You used to be shy
Each feature improved, each movement refined and eyes like a showroom
Now they are spreading out the blankets on the beach
That weatherman is a liar
He said it would be raining but it's clear and blue as far as I can see

Left by the lamp, right next to the bed, 
On a cartoon cat pad she scratched with a pen,
""Everything is as it's always been. 
This never happened.
Don't take it too bad it is nothing you did.
It's just once something dies you can't make it live.
You're a beautiful boy.
You're a sweet little kid but I am a woman.""
So I laid back down and wrapped myself up in the sheet
And I must have looked like a ghost 'cause something frightened me
And since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
And a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I'll try and be kind when I ask you to leave
We'll both take it easy
But if you stay too long inside my memory,
I will trap you in a song tied to a melody
And I will keep you there so you can't bother me",2005,sad

Inside of Love,Nada Surf,"Watching terrible TV
It kills all thought
Getting spacier than
An astronaut
Making out with people
I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do
Late at night

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above

Only when we get to see
The aerial view
Will the patterns show
We'll know what to do
I know the last page so well
I can't read the first
So I just don't start
It's getting worse

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I can't find my way in
I try again and again

[Bridge:]
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
Must be a different view
To be a me with a you

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love

Lately,Stevie Wonder,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

I was yours and you were mine forget it all

That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard

Just waiting

I spoke to a man down at the tracks
And I asked him how he don't go mad

And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad""

There I stand 'neath the marquee moon

Well a Cadillac, it pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me, all they said ""get in"" (""get in"")
Then the Cadillac, it puttered back into the graveyard
Me, I got out again

To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
Then she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun

But now she might leave
Like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her

But now you're scared
You think she's running away
You search in your head for something clever to say
Don't go away
'Cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home, home sweet home",2003,sad
Life 2: The Unhappy Ending,Stars,"[Scene one:] Late at night interior, we find ourselves inside the car

He removes the Lucky from the pack, he knows now that he can't turn back

He realizes that he's through
Whispers, ""Darling let's have fun""
Hits the exit doing 91, drives until he's in the woods
If he loses them he's gone for good

But life, could be nothing but a joke, could be nothing but a con

Why can't the ending be happy?
Why must it always resolve this way?

Says ""Don't worry love we're almost done""
Says ""I could have really been someone""
Outside, they surround the house with pistols drawn
It's a waiting game until dawn
Sergeant says ""He can't go on, we know now that he can't go on...""

Life was supposed to be a film, was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in fire

Passing Afternoon,Iron & Wine,"There are times that walk from you like some passing afternoon 
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon 
And she chose a yard to burn but the ground remembers her 
Wooden spoons, her children stir her Bougainvillea blooms 

There are things that drift away like our endless, numbered days 
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made 
And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings 
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves 

There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass 
Springtime calls her children 'till she let's them go at last 
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring 
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds 

There are things we can't recall, blind as night that finds us all 
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls 
But my hands remember hers, rolling 'round the shaded ferns 
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned 

There are names across the sea, only now I do believe 
Sometimes, with the windows closed, she'll sit and think of me 
But she'll mend his tattered clothes and they'll kiss as if they know 
A baby sleeps in all our bones, so scared to be alone",2004,sad

It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone

And the perfect girls
By the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know about the hive and the honey bees

Almost home
With an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on a TV stand

And the cruel wind blew
Every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes

Almost home
We got lost on our new street
While your grieving girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

And the cops couldn't care
When that crackhead built a boat
And said, ""Please, before I go
May our only honored bone
Be the kinship of the kids and the riot squad""",2007,sad

At the toast and the butter

I was lying in a burned out basement 
With the full moon in my eyes. 
I was hoping for replacement 
When the sun burst thru the sky. 
There was a band playing in my head 
And I felt like getting high. 
I was thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 
Thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver 
Space ships flying 
In the yellow haze of the sun, 
There were children crying 
And colors flying 
All around the chosen ones. 
All in a dream, all in a dream 
The loading had begun. 
They were flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home in the sun. 
Flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home.",2004,sad
The Other Side,Morphine,"I'm going down to the river
There's a man I wanna see
Yeah, he's the ferryman
He'll recognize me

I'm going down now to the riverside
There's a place I wanna be
I'm going to talk to the ferryman
He'll be expecting me

I'm crossing over now to the other side

Life is better there on the other side
The grass is greener there on the other side
And I, I get even there on the other side
And everything will turn out all right on the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
The other sideâ¦

I walked by the church house late last night
Yeah, I walked by the church house, but I didn't go inside
'Cause I, I once slept with the preacher's wife
She handed me a ticket to the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
To the other sideâ¦",1992,sad
Killing Game,Skinny Puppy,"Fallen angel head crashes dead out of control 
Lost memories staircase twists 
Darker rooms lit with left out toys 
After playing mean changes toys into tools
Twisted playthings on the staircase fools
Fools weapons represents the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Awaken eyes sewn wearing glasses dripping tap tap temple door
Locked inside scream inner scraping tooth and nail nowhere to go 
Quiet retraces forcing light tears then pretend nothing blinds 
Blinds closed in sanctuary closed in sanctuary 
Padded walls not quiet storm's fury burnt out killing time 
Who taught the killing game 
Time's taught the killing game herself 
No I taught the killing game first 
Passing words distant pain remember trains of thought collide
No one view window 
Pushing faces through shards cold glass poke bloody holes exposed 
I taught the killing game first 
I taught the killing game first 
Tongue lash spewing red 
tortured animal 
wake up time 
Beckons death upon myself 
eyes travelled harden 
Strange no stronger feeling
Tempting motion slows to a crawl 
Places his weaponry in its own trap 
Let go the springs snap shut 
Crazy sharper teeth 
giving in to the jaws of death 
I taught the killing game 
I taught the killing game first 
I taught I taught I taught the game first",1992,sad
I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry,Johnny Cash,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.",1960,sad
Free Man In Paris,Joni Mitchell,"The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es 
Going cafÃ© to cabaret
Thinking how I'd feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery

Ten years old, it was his first glory
Got caught stealing from a nun
Now his love story had begun

Thirty years he spent wandering
A devil's child with dove wings
Oh, he went to prison
In every country he set foot in
Oh, how he loved - he loved prison
How awfully lovely was prison

Pimps and queens and criminal queers

The pure romance was undisputed

Bird On A Wire,Johnny Cash,"Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a knight from an old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons with thee

And if I have been unkind 
I hope that you will just let it go by 
And if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn 
Like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song 
By all I have done wrong 
I'll make it all up to you

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch 
He called out to me ""Don't ask for so much"" 
And a young man leaning on his darkened door 
He cried out to me ""Hey, why not ask for more""

Far More,The Honorary Title,"Is this the sound of our demise
Or is it just the opposite?
I love you and I miss you

It takes a hell of a lot more to complete this

Far more, far more to recreate
Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we can take

When you decide how much time
Do you let, do you let, do you let, do you let
Pass before
These false starts, these small meals
They're for my, for my starving hands
Just treading, just treading shallow waters
Avoiding the drop, the drop in the ocean floor

Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we possess
How much, how much, how much
How much longer, girl
How much longer do we need to wait?

For a moment when the blare of the TV subsides
And that song fills the air, replaying every night
A change in the key feels like a change in the season

I pretend almost every, every other night
That this body and its entirety belongs to me, every breath
It comes and goes
It comes and goes
All night

Well, you can't dictate the way, the way I'm gonna feel
No matter what, no matter what I'm forced to see

At coordinating this kind of mess

Satisfied Mind,Jeff Buckley,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had money, I would do things my way,""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

One thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind,

Dinner At Eight,Rufus Wainwright,"No matter how strong

With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me

Dinner at eight was okay
Before the toast full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again

Why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When it fact you were the one long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You left me

So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives

But 'til then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me

No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me",2003,sad
Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002,sad
Southern Anthem,Iron & Wine,"Just like the way that you ran to wine
When they made the new milk turn
Jesus a friend in the better times
Let your mother's Bible burn
Freedom a fever you suffered through
And the dog drank from your cup
Frozen the river that baptized you
And the horse died standing up

But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down

Just like the way that you lost your guns
When they cut the clothesline loose
Jesus a friend of the weaker ones
Said ""I'm all they stole from you""
Freedom a thistle that withered dry
Still a baby in your hands
Frozen the ground refused to die
And the guitar rose again

But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down",2002,sad

Those days are gone You and I were young those summer nights 
You'll see the world diving for a girl you'll never find

After laughter, comes tears

[Verse One: The RZA]

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh HA
Not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's alway the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer]

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin out
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff 
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

Cherish the light for us,
Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn.

The traffic of life is flowing,
Out over the rivers and on into dark.

I'm going down town where there's music,
I'm going where voices fill the air,
Maybe there's someone waiting for me
With a smile and a flower in her hair

I'm going down town where there's people
The loneliness hangs in the air.
With no-one there real waiting for me,
No smile, no flower nowhere.

It swam for the light

The cities that float there

My street, my street

So come in and play
The song of the siren
It's commonplace
You hear the voice rise
In one wave
And crash on your doorstep
Making the circle here perfect, complete

Kicking cans 'cross the sky
No reason why
Why ask to pay yourself
For the call of the wild
You found this child
So raise him

And wind your back
Come back to the river
The currents speed by
And hope the men fear
The hammer comes down
So hard on the evening
Cracking the dawn of your
Days are repeat
These are fables on my street
My street, my street

Heaven shook Hell
And down from its pockets
The ring in your bell
It fell through your hands
Hang at your feet
The doors that won't open
Marking the journey of our friends complete
These are the fables of my street

Lay down in glory, you're not alone",2005,sad
The Animals of the World,Great Lake Swimmers,"Watching the night animals
bellying close to the ground
I was walking in the dark
It was following some feral scent
Like I was crossing the road
Like I was
Following those streets to their destinations

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end we all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the winds
Biding the tides
Riding the winds
Or biding the tides

Flying with the sun
Or perched in a row
I was at a window sill
They were unaware like I was
A moment there and then gone
Like I was
Looking for a place to rest

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end
We all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the wheels
Biding the streets
Riding the wheels
Or biding the streets",2003,sad
Fly,Nick Drake,"Please give me a second grace,
Please give me a second face,
I've fallen far down, the first time around, 
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly

Please tell me your second name, 
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are, 
I just need your star for a day

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny, 
For it's really too hard for the fly",1970,sad
Maybe Sparrow,Neko Case,"Maybe sparrow you should wait

Oh my sparrow it's too late
Your body limp beneath my feet
Your dusty eyes cold as clay
You didn't hear my warning

Maybe sparrow it's too late
Moonlight glanced off metal wings
In a thunderstorm above the clouds
The engine hums a sparrow's phrase
For those who cannot hear the words
For those who will not hear the words
For those who will not hear the words

Things just start as they sing

The ones you told to leave alone
On the devil's shoulder I leaned
As I fell through the clouds like a storm

Confessions,Peter Murphy,"I could use your gullibility
Distort the painful truth
Present a fear and laugh at you
Leave you lost unsure removed
The must I feel to put it right
Put an end to naive faith
In slick successes avenue
The vacuum of save face

Direct words can turn lost minds
Towards some monster seed
Lyrics sung from pretty looks
Can on the reader feed
Be strong to check and recognise
The pretty face is all
But being used to sell you songs
That never say it all

The incident meets the senses
The illusions in a mask
The sun of a summer afternoon
Docility rocks the mask
Broken loose from moorings
In a flash the swell had passed
Towards the beach with unabated speed
Confessions of a mask",1986,sad

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
Is it a lady or is it a man 
Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

On my feet to chase it down 
The lights were spokes and rungs away 
I stumbled back and hit the floor 
Long shadows crawl beneath the door 
To a passage so poorly lit 
There's moths flying away from it 

Who am I tonight? La, da, da

Darkness enter prison girls 
Pushing mops and kicking pails 
Now's my chance 
I clasp my chest 
And declare unto my audience 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

Prison girls are not impressed 
They're the ones that have to clean this mess 
They've traded more for cigarettes

Their thoughts too dry above their heads

Roses Blue,Joni Mitchell,"I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to",1969,sad
Dear Chicago,Ryan Adams,"Dear Chicago, 
You'll never guess. 
You know the girl you said I'd meet someday? 
Well, I've got something to confess. 
She picked me up on Friday. 
Asked me if she reminded me of you. 
I just laughed and lit a cigarette, 
Said ""that's impossible to do."" 
My life's gotten simple since. 
And it fluctuates so much. 
Happy and sad and back again. 
I'm not crying out to much. 
Think about you all the time. 
It's strange and hard to deal. 
Think about you lying there. 
And those blankets lie so still. 
Nothing breathes here in the cold. 
Nothing moves or even smiles. 
I've been thinking some of suicide. 
But there's bars out here for miles. 
Sorry about the every kiss. 
Every kiss you wasted (bad / back)
I think the thing you said was true, 
I'm going to die alone and sad. 

The wind's feeling real these days. 
Yeah, baby, it hurt's me some. 
Never thought I'd feel so blue.

I let go

With the sounds it makes you won't hear it if I call
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves so I choose to sink

Your skin protected me from sunbeams
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
I let go
I let go

You were always there to walk me home
With you not here, the streets I roam
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves as I choose to sink
With your voice in my head
I would float here instead
But there's a calm under the waves
So I choose to sink

I've heard it's pretty where you are

Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.

This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.

Suicide Underground,Air,"Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood 
from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped out elms,
and the harsh sunlight. 

Some thought the tortures tearing the Lisbon girls
pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world 
as it was handed down to them.
So full of flaws.

But the only thing we are certain of 
after all these years,
is the insufficiency of explanation.
(Obviously, doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl.)

The Lisbon girls were
13 - Cecilia
14 - Lux
15 - Bonnie
16 - Mary 
and 17 - Therese.

No one could understand how 
Mrs Lisbon and Mr Lisbon, 
our math teacher, 
had produced such beautiful creatures.

From that time on
The Lisbon house began to change.
Almost everyday
and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on a towel,
wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife sharpener
to give her a 15 minute demonstration for free.

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
was Trip Fontaine.
Who only 18 months before the suicides,
had emerged from baby fat, 
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
and Mrs Lisbon shut the house in maximum security isolation.

The girls' only contact with the outside world
was through the catalogs they ordered,
that started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
with pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.

Unable to go anywhere,
the girls traveled in their imaginations.
To gold tipped Siamese temples, or past an old man with a leaf broom,
tiding a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

And Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

Collecting everything we could of theirs,
we couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds.
But they were slipping away.
The colours of their eyes were fading
along with exact locations of moles and dimples.

From 5 they had become 4,
and they were all, the living and the dead,
becoming shadows. 

We would have lost them completely 
if the girls hadn't contacted us.

Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house we had forgot to stop at the garage.

After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr Hedly pack up the house,
selling what furniture he could in a garage sale.

Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
and they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.

We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been.
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them.
And they hadn't heard us calling..still do not hear us,
calling them out of those rooms.
Where they went to be alone for all time.

Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper then death.
And where we will never find the pieces,
to put them back together.",,sad

Mr. Writer,Stereophonics,"You line them up
Look at your shoes
You hang names on your wall

You fly around in planes

To meet me who loves you, like
Me crashing to the ground

Why don't you tell it like it really is?

I used to treat you right
Give you my time
But when I'd turn my back on you
Then you do what you do

You've just enough, in my own view
Education to perform
I'd like to shoot you all

With you on your own
What do you really know?

So I can believe 
You had so much to give 
You thought I couldn't see 

Gifts for boot heels to crush 
Promises deceived

Silent waters, deep

Other room, asleep 

A kiss ""Goodnight"" from every 
Stranger that I meet

To bring us back again

Unpretender left 
Ungraceful 

True self is what 
Brought you here, to me 
A place where we can 
Accept this love 

Friendship battered down by 
Useless history 
Unexamined failure 

But what am I still to you 
Some thief who stole from you? 
Or, some fool drama queen 
Whose chances were few? 

That brings us to who we need 
A place where we can save 
A heart that beats as 
Both siphon and reservoir 

You're a woman, I'm a calf 
You're a window, I'm a knife 
We come together 
Making chance in the starlight 

Meet me tomorrow night 
Or any day you want 
I have no right to wonder 
Just how, or when 

You know the meaning fits 
There's no relief in this 
I miss my beautiful friend 

I have to send it away 
To bring her back again.",1998,sad
Forgotten Hopes,Anathema,"Hey you.. rotting in your alcoholic shell
Banging on the walls of your intoxicated mind
Do you ever wonder why you were left alone
As your heart grew colder and finally turned to stone

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

Pathetic oblivion
Forgotten hopes buried in your soul's lonely grave
Pathetic oblivion
Remember how you were before you locked your heart away

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

To look but not to see
To kiss but never be

And there's no one at all
To break my fall

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,"When the day is done

Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

No life springs without decay

Now Comes the Night,Rob Thomas,"When the hour is upon us

Gone,Ben Folds,"I thought I'd write, I thought I'd let you know
In the year since you've been gone I've finally let you go
And I hope you find some time to drop a note
But if you won't
Then you won't
And I will consider you gone

I know that you went straight to someone else
While I worked through all this sh*t here by myself
And I think that you should spend some time alone
But if you won't
Then you won't
And I will consider you gone

I wake up in the night
All alone and it's alright
The chemicals are wearing off
Since you've gone

The days go on, the lights go off and on
And nothing really matters when you're gone
If you think that you feel nothing at all

Then you won't
And I will
Then I will

And I could make you rue the day

The sweetest song you ever heard

Not for all my little words

Now that you've made me want to die
You tell me that you're unboyfriendable
And I could make you pay and pay

Blood,The Middle East,"Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And youâll hear your sister sleep talking
Say, âYour hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might beâ

And she woke up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
Sheâll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, youâll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings

Oh, and youâll find somebody you can blame
And youâll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And youâll find the peace of the Lord.

Grandfather, weary soul, youâll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
Youâve waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And thereâs nothing you can do about it now",P:  ,sad

Draws around me softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And the candle dies

When night comes down you lock the door
The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls the waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields
A cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds and I go down
Sleeping time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird
In the haze and the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die",1971,sad

And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me

Even though I don't have anything that I could bargain with.

This is like a well-oiled machine. Could I please see that smile again?
It's all that makes me feel that I am living in this world
I see you closing all the doors. I see the walls as they go up
I know it's what you have to do. I'd probably do the same thing, too, my dear.

Just do it then I'll let you go. Just say the words and say them slowly.

Allow me to be every noise in your ear

Every morning which is good
But my stomach's churning, call me,
It would be nice if you could

Some days I question
The suggestion
You might not exist at all
Can we meet and talk it over
Would you be kind enough to call

Over and over
It's over all over
And over and over and over
And over.....

No there's no middle ground
Your off in another story
Or merry-go-round

No there'll be no measured terms
You fly in the face of the way the world turns

Like a frozen tidal wave
Since that day I'm standing still
You brought me here and I accept
Though you regret I never will

Just one sweet word
And then a smile from you
Is almost worth everything
I've given all I had to give
But you gave up giving in

You are everywhere I go
All the places we have been

You throw your pearls at swine

She travelled across Tennessee

He introduced himself as Richard Slade

When she saw the ocean for the first time
O poor Mary Bellows 
She checked into a cheap little place
Richard Slade carried in her old suitcase
O poor Mary Bellows 
""I'm a good girl, sir"", she said to him
I couldn't possibly permit you in
O poor Mary Bellows 
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
And turned away without goodbye
O poor Mary Bellows

With the sea breeze whistling all alone
O poor Mary Bellows 
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
And undid the latch on the front door
O poor Mary Bellows 
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head

Don't let them journey all alone
Tell them this world is full of danger
And to shun the company of strangers

You got me hot
Then you blew me out
Like this match I'm about to light

Maybe I might lose my head
One thing I gotta do
Is torch those sheets and pillows too

How could I be so blind

My hours are slumberless,
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy
with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,Bob Dylan,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, that roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall",1963,sad

'Cello Song,Nick Drake,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969,sad
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969,sad

From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

Not a single word was said
The night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon - in a room of ninety five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man

Just to let me know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

Goodbye to you

Small Blue Thing,Suzanne Vega,"Today I am
A small blue thing
Like a marble
Or an eye

With my knees against my mouth
I am perfectly round
I am watching you

I am cold against your skin
You are perfectly reflected
I am lost inside your pocket
I am lost against
Your fingers

I am falling down the stairs
I am skipping on the sidewalk
I am thrown against the sky

I am raining down in pieces
I am scattering like light
Scattering like light
Scattering like light

Today I am
A small blue thing
Made of china
Made of glass

I am cool and smooth and curious
I never blink
I am turning in your hand
Turning in your hand
Small blue thing",1985,sad
Lovestain,José González,"You left a lovestain on my heart

That I Would Be Good,Alanis Morissette,"that I would be good even if I did nothing
that I would be good even if I got the thumbs down
that I would be good if I got and stayed sick
that I would be good even if I gained ten pounds

that I would be fine even if I went bankrupt
that I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
that I would be great if I was no longer queen
that I would be grand if I was not all knowing

that I would be loved even when I numb myself
that I would be good even when I am overwhelmed
that I would be loved even when I was fuming
that I would be good even if I was clingy

that I would be good even if I lost sanity
that I would be good
whether with or without you",1998,sad
Independence Day,Bruce Springsteen,"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late 
Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now 
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate 
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow 
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us 
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too 
But they can't touch me now 
And you can't touch me now 
They ain't gonna do to me 
What I watched them do to you 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day 
All down the line 
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day this time 

Now I don't know what it always was with us 
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines 
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us 
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind 

Well say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day all boys must run away 
So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
All men must make their way come Independence Day 

Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint 
And the highway she's deserted clear down to Breaker's Point 
There's a lot of people leaving town now 
leaving their friends, their homes 
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone 

Well Papa go to bed now, it's getting late 
Nothing we can say can change anything now 
Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways 
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say 
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
I swear I never meant to take those things away",1980,sad
Shut Out the Light,Bruce Springsteen,"The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down
He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town
He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar
He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark
Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
And undid an extra button on her blouse
He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am
He was staring at the ceiling
He couldn't move his hands

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said ""Johnny Welcome Home""
Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome
His mama said ""Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me""
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
In the cold black water Johnson Leneir stands
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light",,sad

Anna Begins,Counting Crows,"My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
I am not worried,
I am not overly concerned

My friend implored me,
""For one time only
Make an exception.""
I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried 
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
""Oh"", she says, ""you're changing.""
We're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love

Because if you don't want to talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess I'm gonna have to live without
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things
You try to tell yourself to make yourself forget
To make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" she said,
""Then we're gonna have to think about the consequences""
But she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering
For days,"" she says.
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend.
And I'm not gonna break and
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say,
""As long as this is love...""
But it's not all that easy
So maybe I should 
Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause I've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
But I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind
Every time she sneezes I believe it's love
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand
And, oh, Lord, I m not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away.
She disappears,
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing",1993,sad
Top of the World,Dixie Chicks,"I wished I was smarter

Go to work in the rain 
I don't know why 
Don't know why

'Cause everone's singing 
We just wanna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Wanna grab a hold of that little song bird

The Weakness In Me,Joan Armatrading,"I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you get my attention

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly

Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep
If I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
And I need you, and you

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly",1981,sad

And cold feet
Who says ""Here's two bits, go and eat""?
Nobody

Well, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime

All warm and clear
And my friends see me
Drawin' near
Who says ""Come on in and have a beer""?

Well, one time when things was lookin' bright
I started to whittlin' on a stick one night
Who said ""Hey! That's dynamite!""?

Into The Dark,Melissa Etheridge,"There were stairs they were steep
I was falling falling deep 
You were there you were small 
There was screaming down the hall

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There comes a time we all know 
There's a place that we must go
Into the soul into the heart 
Into the dark 

There was fire there was death
There was lying on your breath
I turned away I would pretend 
But the burning never ends 

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There was a wave over the house 
There was fear choked in my mouth 
You were there you left your mark 
As I stumbled in the dark",1999,sad

Lost Unto this World,Emmylou Harris,"I was once some mother's darlin'
Some daddy's little girl
More precious than the ruby
More cherished than the pearl
My heart was full of mercy
And my forehead full of curl
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world
I am lost unto this world...

They herded me like cattle
Cut me down like corn
Took me from my babies
Before they could be born
You can blame it on the famine
You can blame it on the war
You can blame it on the devil
It don't matter anymore
I am lost unto this world...

I was tortured in the desert
I was raped out on the piain
I was murdered by the high way
And my cries went up in vain
My blood is on the mountain
My blood is on the sand
My blood runs in the river
That now washes thru their hands
I am lost unto this world...
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil
Was God the only one there watching
And weeping as l feil
O you among the living
Will you remember me at all
Will you write my name out
With a single finger scrawl
Across a broken window
In some long forgotten wall
That goes stretching out forever
Where the tears of heaven fall
I am lost unto this world...",2003,sad
Song for the Angels,Great Lake Swimmers,"The echo to your yell
The ripple to your dive
The currents under your wave

Electricity 
Flows through me
I send it out to you
We were charged 
With the founding poles
Of a million years
A million years
Before us 
Have trembled in their fears

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you where there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

I know that I am just a grain of sand
Meeting water at the land
We could make our castles here
And sweep them all away

I know that I am just a drop of water
Frozen into ice on the stormy earth 
Who gave us birth
Over and over in cycles 
Lovely cycles

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me",2005,sad
Waiting for Love,Pink,"[Verse 1]
She looks to the sun 
Help her to carry on
Braking down all the years 
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky 
Counting the reasons why 
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past

[B-Section]
All the changes, and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says

[Verse 2]
She looks to the stars
Breaking, time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

[B-Section]
And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
A she is starting to drown

[Chorus]
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
Waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long

[Verse 3]
She prays to the Gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where I am today
Life is looking very grey

[B-Section]
All the changes, all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm waiting for a new day to rise
COnversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And I want it, and I need it, and I'll leave it all behind

And all the changes I've made
And I remember the words, that you'll never say

Without a single place to go of interest 
And I'm further North than South

So buy a pretty dress 
And wear it out tonight 
For all the boys you think could out do me 
Or better still be my winding wheel 

Be my winding wheel

Wear it out tonight

Or better still be my winding wheel

July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight.

August, die she must,
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old.",1966,sad

I do the best imitation of myself

The ""problem with you"" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
The best imitation of myself",1995,sad

It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry,Glasvegas,"Let the raining teardrops rain down on me tonight
I think making up, faking up stories is alright
Tick tock stop the clock, fiction is my thing
My attitude is always I and me and mine

Oh I'm so clever
Until my paranoia kicks in then I'll accuse her
Of doing all the worst things i do best
Its funny how me, fucking her about,
Has got me in this fucking mess

Liar liar pants on fire
Lies alibis lies more alibis
From the truth, I admit I'm more than shy
Ain't the the times we are living in
Everybody's doing it so why cant i?

I tally up tonight's strangers
And stragglers that I've kissed
Training ground notches, perfectly executed notches
And near misses
Its all about going out and getting pissed with eagle eyes
And sincerity bottom on my list
What's the story morning glory?
I feel so low and worthless

So this is where the outcome unfurls and the truth is being told
A cloud has gathered over my head and now i know
Infidelity and my good friend ecstasy doesn't work, it makes you worse
I'm feeling so guilty about the things i said to my mum when i was ten years old
I'm feeling so guilty about any old shit
And how I think my missus is fucking every guy that she looks at
This is it, the end was always coming and now its here

So this is the grande finale
The crescendo of demise
This is the happy ending
Where the bad guy goes down and dies
This is the end
With me on my knees and wondering why?
Cross my heart, hope to die
Its my own cheating heart that makes me cry",2008,sad

The Mercy Seat,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.
And I'll say it again
I.. am.. not.. afraid.. to.. die.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand
tattooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that devil blood.

And the mercy seat is a-burning
And I think my head is flowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway, there was no proof
And nor a motive why.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A life for a life
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.

Now the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A eye for a eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm not afraid to lie.

And the mercy seat is waiting

Where We Would Be,Porcupine Tree,"[Written by Steven Wilson]

Tied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...

And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

If I could find you
And tell you about my life
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...

And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

Watch them all go down
They can tell you what you want to hear
But they will never stick around
So don't say nothing bout the old house
Cos I burned it to the ground
And when the darkness comes I'll lie and wait
Still playing lost and found
All at once
I break my silence
All at once
There's no more hiding
And all he wants is to show us how he feels
When he comes around
Do not tell him nothing
Do not make a sound
Cos if he knows we're there
He might tear his heart out 
And beat us to death with it

Father Of Mine,Everclear,"Father of mine
Tell me where have you been
You know I just closed my eyes
My whole world disappeared
Father of mine
Take me back to the day
When I was still your golden boy
Back before you went away
I remember the blue skies, walking the block
I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk
You would take me to the movie
You would take me to the beach
Take me to a place inside that is so hard to reach
Father of mine
Tell me where did you go
You had the world inside your hand
But you did not seem to know
Father of mine
Tell me what do you see
When you look back at your wasted life and you don't see me
I was ten years old
Doing all that i could
It wasn't easy for me to be a scared white boy in a black neighborhood
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
With a five dollar bill
I never understood you then and I guess I never will
Daddy gave me a name
My dad he gave me a name
Then he walked away
Daddy gave me a name
Then he walked away
My dad gave me a name
Father of mine
Tell me where have you been
I just closed my eyes
And the world disappeared
Father of mine
Tell me how do you sleep
With the children you abandoned
And the wife I saw you beat
I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I am a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear I'm not going to let her know
All the pain I have known

Daddy gave me a name

Maid Of Bond Street,David Bowie,"This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairs",1967,sad
Fewer Words,Badly Drawn Boy,"Bet you wish you knew what time it is
And it's clear that you don't
Understand a love that requires fewer words

Never trivialise the kiss
Oh it feels like there's no fire left in your eyes

Andalucia,Yo La Tengo,"Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer closer and dearer

Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter - I love you

Ill be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away

When you'd made up your mind not to come
And I couldn't persuade you
Or wait till tomorrow - or pass the time",1990,sad
Never Went to Church,The Streets,"Two great European narcotics,
Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer

We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.

On your birthday when mom passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.

Put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but..
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.
Panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you

[Chorus]

I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away.
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.

I never cared about God when life was sailin' in the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mom says me and you are the same from the start.

I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.

[Chorus x2]

But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.

I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
You always said I should hedge my bets.",2006,sad

Drowned World/Substitute for Love,Madonna,"I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game

Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion",1998,sad
The Next Time You Say Forever,Neko Case,"I hear the tiniest sparks in the tenderest sound. 
Diving music, drowning the sound. 
waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. 
And your fire flood alarm, and you tremble, and you stumble, and you scrape up your palms. 
I can't stay here to hold your hand. 
I've been away for so long. 
I've lost my taste for home, and that's a dirty fallow feeling.
To be the dangling ceiling. 
From the roof came crashing down. 
Peeling in the heat.
Vanish in the rain.
The next time you say forever, I'll punch you in your face. 
Just because you don't believe it, doesn't mean I didn't mean it.
You never know when I'll show you the never.
You never know when I'll show you the never.",2009,sad

How to find my way back

Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And i guess i may never understand

One fallen hero with a face like me?
And if I scream, could anybody hear me?

These Streets,Paolo Nutini,"Cross the border
Into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour
Just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul 
from the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to delay this sadness
That creeps up my spine
And haunts me through the night

Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wandering around
With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody floods to their ideal place
And the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy

One hour's a waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same

Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)

My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read your letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, yourself
I keep thinking of you darling
I keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way
So I could come home to see you
But things don't look too good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could miss any one person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer 'til I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life",2003,sad

It stretches on forever
I walk through this abyss of consciousness
Relying only on my heartbeat when I face you
The open blue reflecting eternal possibility
The words we exchange intertwine
A melancholy figure, hanging heavily
Surfaces in my mind
There must be a heart there
Soon noise will drown it out
Returning to the concealed light
My voice raised, yearning to go back
White waves stop quietly
The song of the clouds breaking the surface
Letters of promise to the insane sunlight
I gaze at the fragments of thought spread out at my feet
Tears of hope for those unfulfilled
To whom do the stars belong?
Someday this sadness' end
Will be returned to us and the story will continue
Silhouettes reflected in my eyes
Countless faint smiles lined up before me
Gazing towards the exit
This beloved landscape
A vision brings
An instant of whiteness and the palm of my hand
All exists within one stride
Bells sound the arrival of the flood
The bridge of the sky and the clamour of twilight
I pass through this night in silence
I extinguish my lamp and in the moonlit street
Give an innocent smile for the happiness to come",2006,sad

Scratched in metal, name erodes away

I Fell in Love With a Dead Boy,Antony and the Johnsons,"I find you
With red tears in your eyes
I ask you what is your name
You offer no reply

Should I call a doctor
For I fear that you might be dead
But I just lay down beside you
And held your head

I fell in love with you
Now you're my one and only
Cause all my life I've been so blue
But in that moment you fulfilled me

Now I tell all my friends
I fell in love with a dead boy
And I tell my family
I wish you could have met him

I write letters to Australia
I throw a bottle out to sea
And I whisper the secret in the ground
No one's gonna take you away from me

I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy
And I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy

Oh, such a beautiful boy
I ask him, ""Are you a boy or a girl
Are you a boy or a girl""

Are you a boy or are you a girl
Are you a boy or are you a girl
Are you a boy or are you a girl",P:  ,sad

Thought you could love

There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldn't I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldn't stand to chance without you

You said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldn't believe it

And on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

Thought there was love
What a fool I was

And everything was in hyper-jinx
Just like an old time movie

You don't understand
Can't comprehend

And every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

When Sorrow Sang,Blind Guardian,"So let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back light and hope for all

And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand

Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) hope's turned to dust
At all

Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon

[Chorus:]
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet

I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye

Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her

So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind

The Carpenter,Nightwish,"Who are you?
Man condemned to shine a salvation
throughout the centuries
Why ?
Was the wine of the grail
too sour for man to drink

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter

The one they lick
The same old sick
dream of their precious saviour

Kiss them deep and

make them weep
over promises of eternal peace

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter

I hear you
through the symphonic voices of nature
- the purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
and observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died

To Live Is to Hide,Lacuna Coil,"[Music: Coti Zelati/Lyrics: Scabbia - Ferro]

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking in their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause a blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

I'm going to freeze
Is it my imagination?
It's underground

But I can feel it the same

What I need now
What I need is to live to hide
When you smothered my devotion
With your lies

And I feel now
As I did that time
That I'm wondering why
Still I make you cry

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause to blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

Suffering while I'm depending on seasons
Roots under me are embracing the earth",2001,sad

How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied?

And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough

Alternative 4,Anathema,"It's killing you, you're killing me
I'm clinging on to my sanity
All I need is a short term remedy
Come and hide me from this terrible reality...

Dreaded memories flood back to me
But there's still a willful mind behind these cold
psychotic eyes
Now I tread this path so differently
I've opened my mind and darkened my entire life.

I'll dance with the angels to celebrate the holocaust,
And far beyond my far gone pride,
Is knowing that we'll soon be gone,
Knowing that I'll soon be gone...

Hearts of Olden Glory,Runrig,"There's thunder clouds around the hometown bay
As I walk out in the rain
Through the sepia showers
And the photo flood days

I caught a fleeting glimpse of life
And though the water's black as night
The colours of Scotland leave you young inside

There's a vision coming soon
Through the faith that cleans your wound
Hearts of olden glory will be renewed

Down the lens where the headlands stand
I feel a healing through this land
A cross for a people
Like wind through your hands

There must be a place under the sun
Where hearts of olden glory grow young",1987,sad
Send In The Clowns,Frank Sinatra,"[Spoken intro]
This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent, oh, quite a long time
together, till one day
one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave. Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant.
It's a breakup.
It's a lovely marriage of words and music, written by Stephen Sondheim.

Isn't it rich? Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground and you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around and one who can't move
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted  was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair

Sure of my lines
Nobody's there

Don't you love a farce? My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want, sorry my dear
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Don't bother they're here

Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late in my career
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Well, maybe next year",ompi,sad
Cry! Cry! Cry!,Johnny Cash,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye, ""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.",1957,sad
Swanheart,Nightwish,"All those beautiful people
I want to have them all
All those porcelain models
If only I could make them fall

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

Once upon a tale
An Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrow's carol
Dreaming the stars

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

Just a dying faith
On a heaven's gate

Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born",1998,sad
This Night Has Opened My Eyes,The Smiths,"In a river the colour of lead
Immerse a baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
He said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
So, save your life
Because you've only got one

The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh but then again she left pain
So please save your life
Because you've only got one

The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh you did a bad thing

I've Seen That Movie Too,Elton John,"I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
`Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your B films
Because I've seen that movie too",1973,sad

Yeah maybe someday

I've got to let it go and leave it gone
Just walk away, stop it going on
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long
But maybe someday...

I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel, and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come...
Again!

So tell me someday's come tell me some days come again...

No I won't do it some more, doesn't make any sense
If it can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense
But maybe someday...

I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel, and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come...

If I could do it again maybe just once more
Think I could make it work like I did it before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday is the end
Oh maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again...",2000,sad

Made foundations quiver
Every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break
And I shiver...

The leftover tallow just doesn't contain
All the right answers
Under a sea of dust lies a vast wealth of wisdom

An untouched snow turns red
Innocence dies

All that remains is just a feint of what was meant to be
This black page in history is not colourfast, will stain the next
And nothing seems in life, in dreams like what was meant to be",2003,sad
Duk Koo Kim,Sun Kil Moon,"Looking out on my roof last night
Woken up from a dream
I saw a typhoon coming in close
Bringing the clouds down to the sea

Making the world look gray and alone
Taking all light from my view
Keeping everyone in
And keeping me here with you

Around you now
I can't sleep no more, baby
Around you still
Don't want to leave yet

Woken up from a dream last night
Somewhere lost in war
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
I didn't feel right anymore

I knew there I'd die alone
With no one to reach to
But an angel came down
And brought me back to you

I'd rather leave
This world forever, baby
Than let life go
The way it's going

Watching an old fight film last night
Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
But the pounding took to him

And there in the square he lay alone
Without face, without crown
And the angel who looked upon him
She never came down

You never know
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Out of the air
Out of nowhere

Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love

All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Two headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
There is no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go",1998,sad
Lament,The Cure,"Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile

Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh the smell as candles die

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge",ompi,sad
Dream Brother,Jeff Buckley,"There is a child sleeping near his twin 
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind 
That dark angel he is shuffling in 
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair 
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair 
Her green eyes blew goodbyes 
With her head in her hands 
and your kiss on the lips of another 
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world. 

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
Nobody ever came 
Nobody ever... 

I feel afraid and I call your name 
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain 
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another 
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 

Ah do you meet the one I love 
and smell the one who loves you

dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over",1994,sad
Blind,TV on the Radio,"I seen a girl
With a guy
With hair like yours
From what I remember

He took her hand
And smiled her name
Her face like yours
She smiled the same

From what I remember
Been so long since last December
She walked your walk
She talked like you

She shimmered strong
She shined right through
From what I remember
I said I seen a girl

With a guy
So who I'd seen
So who am I
Now I can't remember


Been so long since last December
So I'm sending
Open letter to the perfect girlfriend

I'm still mighty tiny
Hoping that you'd be my little godsend
Because right now I'll take any and blindly
Before I find another noose to fit us

Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other
What's the difference
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Open letter to the legions leering
Oh, how we entertained you
Why don't you cast your gaze into the moonlit clearing

Cause my love, my love is a suckerbet
Before I find another noose to fit us
Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other

What's the problem
Why don't you save yourself 
I'll save you all the time
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame

Pulling Our Weight,The Radio Dept.,"In time we might walk the straight line
But with memories of a grapevine
A guitar, as we came close from far
Forgot about the war
We barely touched
As if being watched

Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line
Pulling our weight

Many miles from where Iâm sleeping
You share laughter in the evening
As do I, in the great divine
Yours is mine
Weâll find love
The kind weâre dreaming of

Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line

As it is
I must fill your space with lies

Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

There will be noise 
There will be glad 
And a perfect bed

Before you write it down 
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes 
And the jacket too

A Time to Be So Small,Interpol,"We saw you from the ocean's side, from under the boat
We saw you making knots, we saw you get the rope

We saw you in distraction: a sleeping, slow despair
Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature âThough you wish you were the wind
â¦Ã Ã£ boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end

He whistles and he runs so hold him fast

Saves its doors for the dead men

Take what you will, what you will
And leave. Could you kill, could you kill me
If the world was on fire 
and nothing was left but hope or desire 
And take all that I could bring forth, is this hell
Or am I on the floor over-desperate? 
Hold hands streaming of blood again?
And then take full weight of me 
Guard my dreams, figure this out, 
It's me on my own. Helpless, hurting, hell
Will you stay strong as you promised?
Cause I'm stranded and bare.
Meanness is washed up in all that I am 
is God. Take this and all,
Then grace takes me to a place 
Of the father you never had 
Ripping and breaking and tearing apart 
This is not heaven
This is my hell.",2007,sad
Murder in the City,The Avett Brothers,"If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over alarmed
I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both
In so many different ways""

If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list
Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name",P:  ,sad

And if you're leaving well come 
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now now
Before you turn around

Astair you're there and I'm still here
I swear I'm so confused
The signs you wear are making me
Feel like I'm the one to lose

99% Of Us Is Failure,Matthew Good,"I know that it's bad
That it's the kind that they can't operate on
And I know it's real slow, honey
Painful and real slow
Styrofoam coffee cups
And bagged drugs that never work enough
And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands

There's no going back

The TV's on, I turn it off
Walk outside, get in the car
Stare at the wheel then fall apart

I get it all the time
Bright eyes to bat and hide behind
But I know they're just for show, honey
Painful and just for show
Black rooms to babysit
White halls to pace and wait for it
And I know it's too slow, honey
Painful and real slow

When we were young
And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands
When 99% of us is failure

Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

I find it hard to take

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

Hurt,Johnny Cash,"I hurt myself today

The old familiar sting

Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

Goodbye My Lover,James Blunt,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun.
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.

So, I took what's mine by eternal right,
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there.
I am here for you if you'd only care.

You touched my heart, you touched my soul,
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind, and that I knew, when
My heart was blinded by you.

I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

Goodbye, my lover.
Goodbye, my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I am a dreamer,
And when I wake,
You can't break my spirit.
It's my dreams you take.

And as you move on,
Remember me,
Remember us,
And all we used to be.

I've seen you cry,
I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.

I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine.
And I love you,
I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.

Goodbye, my lover.
Goodbye, my friend.

In mine when I'm asleep.

When I'm kneeling at your feet.

What's really going on below

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah...

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Brick,Ben Folds Five,"6 a.m., day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold
Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth""
And she broke down, and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment we're alone
But she's alone
And I'm alone
And now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly",1997,sad
Lost Cause,Beck,"Your sorry eyes cut through the bone

They see you coming they see you go
They know your secrets and you know theirs
This town is crazy; nobody cares

I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause

No one standing at your door

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear

I am still right here

When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace

What Sarah Said,Death Cab for Cutie,"And it came to me then
That every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time
As I stared at my shoes
In the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409

And I rationed my breaths
As I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak
On the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines
And year-old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind
That our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds

And I knew that you were truth
I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around
At all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said
That ""Love is watching someone die""

So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?",2005,sad

I Will Follow You Into The Dark,Death Cab for Cutie,"Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
I held my tongue as she told me
""Son, fear is the heart of love""
So I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Then I'll follow you into the dark",2005,sad

Where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown

I hear a voice,

As winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun

Years go by
And I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was

Mirror mirror
Where's the crystal palace
But I only can see myself

Skating around the truth
Who I am
But I know, dad, the ice is getting thin

When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind

To be proud of me
I always wanted that myself

And silver fills my eyes.
I kiss her still,
For she will never rise.

Lays her dying hand.

Where we ran.

Like a thief in the night,
The wind blows so light.
It wars with my tears,
That won't dry for many years.

At her should have fled,

To strike her dead.""",1996,sad

Ooh, I think I've forgotten her now.

Her love is a rose, pale and dying.
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go.

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her.
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
She's somewhere out there now.

All of my pain when I think back to when.

Remember her hair as it shone in the sun,
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done.
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again.

But don't fool yourself,
She was heartache from the moment that you met her.
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.

Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head

Is it too late to remind you how we were
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur

Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far

Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true

Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do

More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world",2006,sad
Last Kiss,Pearl Jam,"[Chorus:]
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road straight ahead,
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,
I'll never forget the sound that night.
The screaming tires, the busting glass,
The painful scream that I heard last.

[Chorus]

When I woke up, the rain was pouring down,
There were people standing all around.
Something warm flowing through my eyes,
But somehow I found my baby that night.

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said,
""Hold me darling just a little while.""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss,
I found the love that I knew I had missed.

Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,
I lost my love, my life that night.

Both Sides Now,Joni Mitchell,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
They shake their heads, and they tell me I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life at all",1969,sad
Someone Like You,Adele,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"".

Casimir Pulaski Day,Sufjan Stevens,"2, 3, 4

Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning, at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see his face
In the morning in the window

All the glory when he took our place
But he took my shoulders and he shook my face
And he takes and he takes and he takes",2005,sad

When the water filled every hole.

Making islands where no island should go.
Oh no.

Those people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat.
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door have been silenced forever more.
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before

It's not mine, but I want it so

Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home,
You're a thousand miles away

Is just taking breaths to stay

To try and save your swollen face ,
Though I don't like you anymore,
You lying, trying waste of space..

Before our innocence was lost,
You were always one of those ,
Blessed with lucky sevens ,
And the voice that made me cry .
My Oh My.

You were mother nature's son ,
Someone to whom I could relate ,
Your needle and your damage done,
Remains a sordid twist of fate.
Now I'm trying to wake you up ,
To pull you from the liquid sky ,
Coz if I don't we'll both end up ,
With just your song to say goodbye.
My Oh My.

Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean

Off track with you

If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of this state
You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way
And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out
It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds
So call it quits, or get a grip
You say you wanted a solution; you just wanted to be missed

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget
So you can forget, you can forget

You are calm and reposed
Let your beauty unfold
Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close
You are second-hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins
Holding on to yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain
You are the blood in my veins

I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget",2003,sad
I'm OK,Christina Aguilera,"Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I've carried all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
For you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see next

Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love you gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday
And I'm OK
I'm OK",2002,sad
Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,Elton John,"What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me

When sorry seems to be the hardest word",1976,sad
My Skin,Natalie Merchant,"Take a look at my body
Look at my hands
There's so much here
That I don't understand

Your face-saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them

'Cause I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

Well, contempt loves the silence
It thrives in the dark
With fine winding tendrils
That strangle the heart

They say that promises
Sweeten the blow
But I don't need them
No, I don't need them

I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

I'm a slow-dying flower
I'm a frost-killing hour
Sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Oh, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
Oh, I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel-sweet love of my life
Oh, I need this

I'm a slow-dying flower
Frost-killing hour
The sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Do you remember the way
That you touched me before?
All the trembling sweetness
I loved and adored?

Your face-saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them

I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel-sweet love of my life
Oh, I need this

Well, is it dark enough?
Can you see me?
Do you want me?
Can you reach me?
Or I'm leaving

Better shut your mouth
And hold your breath
You kiss me now
You catch your death
Oh, I mean this

Oh, I need this",1998,sad
Wicked Game,Chris Isaak,"The world was on fire and no one could save me but you

No, I don't want to fall in love (this girl is only gonna break your heart)

Right Where It Belongs,Nine Inch Nails,"See the animal in his cage that you built
Are you sure what side you're on?
Better not look him too closely in the eye
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
See the safety of the life you have built
Everything where it belongs
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
And it's all
Right where it belongs

[Chorus:]
What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is it all you want it to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself
Find yourself afraid to see?

What if all the world's inside of your head
Just creations of your own?
Your devils and your gods
All the living and the dead
And you're really all alone?
You can live in this illusion
You can choose to believe
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
While you're hiding in the trees

[Chorus:]
What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you used to know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is it all you want it to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks
Would you find yourself
Find yourself afraid to see?",2005,sad
Konstantine,Something Corporate,"I can't imagine all the people that you know
And the places that you go
When the lights are turned down low
And I don't understand
All the things you've seen
But I'm slipping in between
You and your big dreams
It's always you in my big dreams

And you tell me
That it's over
But I can't stand here in a patch of four-leaf clover
And you're restless
And I'm naked
You gotta get out
You can't stand to see me shaking
No, could you let me go
I didn't think so

And you don't want to be here in the future
So you say
The present's just a pleasant
Interruption to the past
And you don't wanna look much closer
'Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed
And it did because of me

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone, no
And I'm sleeping in your living room
We don't have much room
To live

And I had dreams that I would learn to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rockstar
And there was hope in me
That I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
But I don't think I care
And if I hurt you then I'm sorry
To just this guilt has got the best of me

And then you bring me home
'Cause we both know what it's like to be alone, no
And I'm dreaming in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

And Konstantine is coming down the stairs
Doesn't she look good
Standing in her underwear?
And I've been thinking, what I've been thinking, you know
But she's been drinking
And it doesn't get me anywhere

And Konstantine came walking down the stairs
And all that I could do
Was touch her long blond hair
And I was thinking, what I was thinking ya know
But we've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere

This is because I can spell confusion with a K
It's hard to like it
It's to dying in another's arms
And why I had to try it

It's to Jimmy Eat World
And those nights in my car
But this time I'm alone
And I don't see those stars

I'm not your star
Isn't that what you said
What you thought this song meant
You thought this song meant

If this is what it takes
To lie in my mistakes
And live with what I did to you
And all the things I put you through

I always catch the clock it's 11:11
And now you wanna talk
It's not hard to dream
You'll always be my Konstantine

They'll never hurt you like I do
No, they'll never hurt you like I do
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

This is to a girl who got into my head
With all these pretty things she did
Hey baby, you know that you keep me up in bed

It's to a girl who got into my head
With all the fucked-up things I did
Hey maybe baby, you could keep me up in bed

My Konstantine
Spin around me like a dream
We played out on this movie screen
And I said
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you

God, I miss you

And then you bring me home
And we'll go to sleep but this time not alone
No no
And you'll kiss me in your living room
And you see, no, that I've been missing in my living room
'Cause it's all you, yeah this is what I miss, what I miss

We don't have much room
I said, does anybody really need that room?
Because we all need a little bit of room
To live

Famous Blue Raincoat,Leonard Cohen,"It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. 

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear 
Did you ever go clear? 

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older 
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
You'd been to the station to meet every train 
And you came home without Lili Marlene 

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life 
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. 

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth 
One more thin gypsy thief 
Well I see Jane's awake -- 

She sends her regards. 

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
What can I possibly say? 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me 
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free. 

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear --

She Has No Time,Keane,"You think your days are uneventful
And no one ever thinks about you
She goes her own way
She goes her own way

You think your days are ordinary
And no one ever thinks about you
But we're all the same
And she can hardly breathe without you

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time

Well, think about the lonely people
Or think about the day she found you
Or lie to yourself
And see it all dissolve around you

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time

Lonely people tumble downwards
And my heart opens up to you

When she says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time",2004,sad
The Greatest,Cat Power,"Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
Stars at night turned deep to dust

Melt me down
Into big black armour
Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honor
Lower me down
To culprit south
Make 'em wash a space in town
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the later parade

Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain
Any feeling

Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
For the later parade

Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
The stars at night turned deep to dust",2006,sad
No Bravery,James Blunt,"There are children standing here

Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he's been here

No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore

Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air

He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another families' turn to die
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness

There are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to accept their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate
Says, he has been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore

Brothers in Arms,Dire Straits,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be

Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged high

And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die

But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",1985,sad

When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

You won't forget her

A Whiter Shade of Pale,Procol Harum,"We skipped the light fandango
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter shade of pale
She said, 'There is no reason
and the truth is plain to see.'
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well've been closed
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
though in truth we were at sea
so I took her by the looking glass
and forced her to agree
saying, 'You must be the mermaid
who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
that my anger straightway died
If music be the food of love
then laughter is its queen
and likewise if behind is in front
then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
and attacked the ocean bed",1995,sad

Set down with due care.

I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide
I won't go 
I won't sleep 
I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave 
I can't hide 
I cannot be 
Until you're resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends 
They might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

[Chorus]",1999,sad
Adam's Song,blink-182,"I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all

I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again

You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone",1999,sad
