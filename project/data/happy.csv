Yellow Submarine,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/yellowsubmarine.html,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

She knows how to rock-n-roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready

Hey Man (Now You're Really Living),Eels,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eels/heymannowyourereallyliving.html,"Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

Made you feel like it's not such a bad world

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what

Never used to give me much of a thrill
But hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh cut grass
And thought about the moment and when it will pass
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave

Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat

And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forevermore

Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Great DJ,The Ting Tings,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tingtings/greatdj.html,"Fed up with your indigestion.
Swallow words one by one.
Folks got high at a quarter to five.

Nothing but the local DJ,
who said he had some songs to play.
What went down from his fooling around
gave hope and a brand new day.

And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah

And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
Oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
gotta love the BPM.
When the smoke was all baton
Remembering how this begun.
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
Where the future plays it all night long.

Penny Lane,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/pennylane.html,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Spaceman,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/spaceman.html,"It started with a low light.
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed,
And then they took my blood type.
It left a strange impression in my head.

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind,
But when they cut me open,
I guess, I changed my mind.

And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name.

And the zipping white light beams,
Disregarding bombs and satellites.

That was the turning point.
That was one lonely night.

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad.

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live.
You know it's gonna haunt me.
So hesitation to this life I give.

You think you might cross over.
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.
You better look it over
Before you make that leap.

And you know I'm fine,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes.
They justify my claim.

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised.

But it was the turning point.
Oh, what a lonely night!

The dream maker's gonna make you mad.

Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance

Ringing

We need right here

Where they never close

You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again

With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Oh, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody love me,
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""

Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

What you and I spoke of

Others only read of the love, the love that I love.

Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice

You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

Whistle for the Choir,The Fratellis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fratellis/whistleforthechoir.html,"Well it's a big big city and it's always the same
Can never be too pretty tell me your name
Is it out of line if I was to be bold to say ""Would you be mine""?

Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen
I know I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream
Though it's 3 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk.

So if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye,
A girl like you's just irresistible

Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out
But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces
And my head's a mess
And it's 4 in the morning, and I'm walking along
Beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong
And it's you, woo hoo
That's got me going crazy for the things you do

So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me
But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
And only a girl like you could be lonely
And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
A boy like me's just irresistible

So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try oh my, you caught my eye
A girl like you's just irresistible",2006,happy

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita, maid, ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid, Rita meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh Lovely Rita meter meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Ah da, ah da (Lovely Rita meter maid)

Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life

Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

My Rollercoaster,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/myrollercoaster.html,"You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
And if home is really where the heart is
Then we're the smartest kids I know
Because wherever we are in this great big world
We'll never be more than a few hours from home... 

And that's important because I need to travel
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And before I had a mini van I road the greyhound bus
My mom would say ""i hope some day you get paid for being kimya dawson"" 

And now I do and it's not much
But it's enough
I've got my scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy 

On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be do do do do do do
I'll be the greatest man of your life 

'cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes
And playing video games in the middle of the night
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride it'll be out of sight
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Four five six seven minutes in the closet 

You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
You know just when to jump off
You're so brave
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight 

Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
As long as it keeps goin' round it's unbelievable

I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
Just slept way too much, just slept

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me

I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
While trying to restructure my character
Because it had become vile to its creator
And through many dreadful nights
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
And waiting for some high times to come again

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile

We make love to some weird sin
We seek out the taciturn

Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

Safely walk to school without a sound

There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class

When silly thoughts go through my head

Billy Brown,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/billybrown.html,"Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life.
Two kids, a dog and then a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man.

He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he'd newly found
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Don't let the stars get you down.
Don't let the waves let you drown.
Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Oh Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go.
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind.
Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind.

And on his journey and his travels on the way,
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say,

I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing

Our dreams,
And they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer.
At least for most of the questions in my heart.
Like: ""Why are we here?"", ""And where do we go?"",
""And how come it's so hard?"".
It's not always easy,
And sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing:
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do

But if all of these dreams
Might find their way into my day-to-day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together

You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I swap the bruising for a bumping sensation
I'll be Ctrl-Alt-deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting

Friction sparks from metal made it look like bleeding

Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact nothing really mattered at all

And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down!
I'm just thankful to be facing the day.
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone.

It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones shake and ring
One of those was someone who knew you

And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling

When they could never have persuaded me,
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools

(Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you happy

I'll be beside the phone waiting for you

Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still

I Don't Feel Like Dancin',Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/idontfeellikedancin.html,"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what you done?'
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one.
You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns.
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile.
You got so many colours, make a blind man so confused.
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So, I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
So, please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound.
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light.

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway

he is an animal
though everything is possible

give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
it's hard to miss you when you follow us about
buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
we'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

And it's
clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
you can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
these are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on...

Though the girls love us we're so

What I Got,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/whatigot.html,"Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot

Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity
Love is what I got
It's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served
Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got

(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Are five kids better than one

Telepathic beautiful creature 
Understanding all of my weakness 
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it 

Cynical and hurt was just me

Part of what I would call amazing 
Took so long to finally see

Good Day,Nappy Roots,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nappyroots/goodday.html,"Let's begin now

Know today, I woke up this morning, and I said
You know, instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around, through ups and downs, waitin' on somethin' to happen
I just said...

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good, change the colors to my phone
Orange Kool-Aid go good with Patron
Oh no, hell no, boy is still my ring tone
Free car wash, had to clean up the Dodge
Give back when I can, just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry, mustard, hot sauce
Light bread and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bop
Last night, hit the pick three, bought some Air Force Ones
Four tall tees, man I'm loving B.G.

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

We're gonna have a good day

We're gonna have a good day

[Fish Scales:]
And I ain't finna worry 'bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground, and that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up, now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks, say I'm headed their way
Heard my cousin cookin' out, I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit, ain't even out in the States
So if I ain't speakin' too soon, but this a hell of a day
And this sticky got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My new grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm A-ok

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Skinny DeVille:]
We might as well do exactly what the children sayin'
Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few, and put up your deuce
If it's beef, put down the peace down, throw up your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your â
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind
Forever and a day, the choice you make is really all fine

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

We're gonna have a good day

Life Is Wonderful,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/lifeiswonderful.html,"It takes a crane to build a crane

Born to Run,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/borntorun.html,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines

Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby, we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider

But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide

Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 

And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Come on, Wendy, tramps like us

Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Day I've never known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out

To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

To let go of the hand that has been 
Clinging by its thick country skin
To my yellow country teeth

Far - Far away from West Virginia

Explaining that the sky holds the
Wind the sun rushes in and a child
With a shotgun can shoot down
Honeybees that sting
BUT THIS BOY COULD USE A LITTLE STING!

Who - Will get me to a party?
Who - Do I have yet to meet?
You - You look a bit like coffee
And you taste a bit like me
How - Can I keep me from moving?

Understand the movement of the wind
Or the waves out in the ocean or how

I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/imyours.html,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
There's no need to complicate.

And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap

He'll look around the room
He won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth
He's a cowboy kid

Yeah he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, boy, in a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?""

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun

Accidentally in Love,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/accidentallyinlove.html,"So she said what's the problem baby
What's the problem I don't know
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
Think about it every time
I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it

How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
Because everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love

Well baby I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love

These lines of lightning
Mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, Come on
Move a little closer
Come on, Come on
I want to hear you whisper
Come on, Come on
Settle down inside my love

Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once
Upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love [x7]

I'm In Love, I'm in Love
I'm in Love, I'm in Love

They keep things loose they keep it tight

Everything considered they forget my name
(ame, ame, ame)

[Chorus]

[Jules in the background:]
This song was in my head, now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
Though I realize, I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around, but just a promise, nothing binding
However can't you see, that you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-along, this song is monotone
I gotta get some soul, gotta get some feeling....

Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?
Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?

And make the fireflies dance

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

It only makes it worse to live without it

I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We were fated to pretend, to pretend

Yeah yeah yeah

Fidelity,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/fidelity.html,"(Shake it up)

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind all this music

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

And suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose we never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall

All my friends say that of course it's gonna get better
Gonna get better
Better better better better
Better better better

I never love nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost
In the sounds
I hear in my mind

Always seems to know the way

It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand

Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day

So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hair do

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Well, does he like butter tarts?

I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
All twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say
What you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Keeping versed and on my feet

Well, I, ""Jared, I love you!""

[Sharon:]
I was lying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws
Out of big fat Slurpee treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

From ten thousand lightning bugs

A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

That I love you (baby girl)

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain

I just wanna write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
OK
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

Sunday afternoon. I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast, I'm
Driving too far. I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
A yellow lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

Sing: dah...

I'm sitting here, I miss the power, I'd like to go out,
Taking a shower, but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed, where nothing ever
Happens - and I wonder.

Isolation - is not the good for me.
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy. Baby anyhow I'll get
Another toy and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
Another lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down

Such Great Heights,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/suchgreatheights.html,"I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch,
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio,
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening

And that frankly will not fly.
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were its not the scene you're thinking of
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion

It's that I can't dance a single step

Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
If only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing

And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Says as long as we're here everything is alright

And I always get confused,
because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
but in discos they turn them on.
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary one note* spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest

But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend

There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels its always near

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)

Unwritten,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/unwritten.html,"I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Brown Eyed Girl,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/browneyedgirl.html,"Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah.

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass

Crawling on your knees toward it

But it's sending me shivers

Crying out for attention

Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decisions to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not

Semi-Charmed Life,Third Eye Blind,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thirdeyeblind/semicharmedlife.html,"Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said...

How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive,
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress one

And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else to get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I was taking sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)

Dancing in the deepest oceans

I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

No!

Born to, born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies,
All you want's one more Saturday.

Well, look here, until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air
And your feet in the fetters
'Til the day...
They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes.

You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with a dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried.

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands,
You keep 'em folded in your lap,
Or raise them up to beg for scraps,
You know, he's holding you down
With the tips of his fingers just the same,
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late,
Or changed by a potion,
And find a handsome young mate
For you to love.

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe,
Well do it now or grow old,
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.

Been alone since you were twenty-one,
You haven't laughed since January,
You try and make like this is so much fun,
But we know it to be quite contrary.

Dare to be one of us, girl,
Facing the android's conundrum,
I felt like I should just cry,
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,
You're Himmler in your coat,
You don't know how long I have been,
Watching the lantern dim,
Starved of oxygen,
So give me your hand,

Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings

To a daydream believer

As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

Daylight,Matt & Kim,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mattkim/daylight.html,"We cut the legs off of our pants
Threw our shoes into the ocean
Sit back and wave through the daylight

Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight
Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself

Maybe I'll paint them in myself [x4]

These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight
It rings like all through the daylight

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
I'll just unplug it for today

Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight

And float down Grand Street in daylight [x4]

New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time

Dog Days Are Over,Florence + the Machine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florencethemachine/dogdaysareover.html,"Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back

She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it, she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind

Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray,
I'm feeling guilty for leading you astray,
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid,
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

And look me in the eyes. Take off that stupid fitted cap.

Pumpkin Soup,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/pumpkinsoup.html,"You're chatting to me, like we connect
But I don't even know if we're still friends
It's so confusing,
Understanding you is making me not want to do

And things that I know I should do
But I trip fast and then I lose
And I hate looking like a fool

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss

The lights are on
And someone's home
I'm not sure if they're alone
There's someone else inside my head
Living there too fills me with dread

This paranoia is distressing
But I spend most of my night guessing
Are we not, are we together
Will this make our lives much better

I'm not in love
I just wanna be touched

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
Whoops I think I've got too close
'Cause now he's telling me I'm girl that he likes most
Now I messed up it's not the first time
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss",2007,happy

Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

May not know

And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!

Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

Wondered if it ever would

Do it again?
I know we should!!!

I'm so fizzy I could burst!
You wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow! it feels so big it almost hurts!

Really didn't think it could
Do it some more?

Hey Julie,Fountains of Wayne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fountainsofwayne/heyjulie.html,"Working all day for a mean little man

You're always there to rub my back

Look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up
Trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
And I'd never make it through without you around

Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of papers that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Counting down the hours 'til I get to see your face

Hey Julie,
Look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up
Trying to wear me down

How did it come to be
That you and I must be
Far away from each other every day?
Why must I spend my time
Filling up my mind
With facts and figures that never add up anyway?
They never add up anyway

Working all day for a mean little guy
With a bad toupee and a soup-stained tie
He's got me running 'round the office
Like a gerbil on a wheel
He can tell me what to do
But he can't tell me what to feel

Como Eneas y Benitin

Que te hicieron por ahÃ­

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo

Pronto verÃ¡s el sol brillar

TÃº mÃ¡s que nadie mereces ser feliz

Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
hasta en tu propio paÃ­s
Si yo te digo Â¿Como dices tu?
Tu aÃºn dices Â¿Que decis?
Y lloras de emociÃ³n oyendo un bandoneÃ³n

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razÃ³n que hace doler tu corazÃ³n

just when you think that you've got a hold,
just when you get on a roll,
here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,

Oh, here it goes again.

Now through lines of the cheap venetian blinds your car is pulling off of the curb.

Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/bowloforanges.html,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002,happy

And I drink cups of tea

You cannot confine

There's nothing that you can gain

Sometimes I floss

Digital Love,Daft Punk,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/digitallove.html,"Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right
To put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Lovefool,The Cardigans,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cardigans/lovefool.html,"Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do!

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

So, I cry, and I beg for you to

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wondered
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

Sleepyhead,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/sleepyhead.html,"And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going

And you said
It was like fire around the brim
Burning solid
Burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I dragged you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

Go ahead",P:  ,happy

What's impossible
Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found

New Shoes,Paolo Nutini,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paolonutini/newshoes.html,"Woke up cold one Tuesday,
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick,
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life,
So I quickly opened the wardrobe,
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean,
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes,
That were ripped around the seams,
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me.

[Chorus:]
Hey, I put some new shoes on,
And suddenly everything is right,
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling,
It's so inviting,
Oh, short on money,
But long on time,
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
And I'm running late,
And I don't need an excuse,
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.

Woke up late one Thursday,
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes,
And I felt like there were two days missing,
As I focused on the time,
And I made my way to the kitchen,
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found,
A room full of all off my friends all dancing round and round,
And I thought hello new shoes,
Bye bye them blues.

[Chorus]

Take me wandering through these streets,
Where bright lights and angels meet,
Stone to stone they take me on,
I'm walking till' the break of dawn. [x2]

Blended angels, whispered love
Countdown 'til it's gone, for long
Velvet voices, haunting slow
Darkened nooks, with bright decor
Georgian femmes are gone for weeks

I'm staring down the Eppley gate
Two more days before the plane arrives
And you'll be standing here with your smile
Carving up the lobby seats
Pushing down the caffeine drinks
Checking the arrival screens for yours

A hundred feet above the landing
There's a girl gliding down
She's floating toward me now
Her sleeves are all stretching out
And the jet is following behind

Wake up

London skids a grinding halt
Last night left to spend apart
Your bags are packed but now for home
Stories of the tour unfold
Booking Agents
Broken Nose
Butting heads with creeping dolts

Junebug skipping like a stone

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slipping dues down to see

That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below

Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules,
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

You Were Always the One,The Cribs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cribs/youwerealwaystheone.html,"I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out

It's all about escaping

Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get trouble with that

You're gonna get trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one

It's nothing to do with acceptance

Know what'll happen to me

And I hope to be free
But I guess that you've heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?

I keep runnin' towards a dream

Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run

And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Hang him on my wall

Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea

He'll think about paint 
and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Crazy for You,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/crazyforyou.html,"Found myself today
Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you",2008,happy

I need to get away to feel again.
Try to understand why,
don't get so close to change my mind.
Please wipe that look out of your eyes,
it's bribing me to doubt myself;
Simply, it's tiring.

This love has dried up and stayed behind,
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide.
Excuse me first love, but we're through.
I need to taste a kiss from someone new.

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.

My Best Friend,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/mybestfriend.html,"When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue

You are such a blessing and I wont be messing 
with the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness

You are my best friend
and I love you, and I love you
Yes I do

There is no other one that can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because I speak sincerely
and I mean it when I tell you I need you

You are my best friend
and I love you, and I love you
Yes I do

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
and I feel the pain you feel when you start crying

No Man's Land,Sufjan Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sufjanstevens/nomansland.html,"Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours; this land is mine.
I see the Captain in red,
and Cairo at his head.
This land is yours; this land is mine.

The lightning over the park,
the waters--brash and dark
We take a swim; we take a swim.
I never meant to escape
the carpet and the trade
This land is yours; this land is mine.

And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back; I take it back.
The numbers over the dam,
Jo Davies and the band,
I count them out; I count them out.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
to the floor

The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
In Charles, we climb the hill 
and Danville window sill
I take it back; I take it back.
My sister she counts the bars,
the Macon county cars,
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.

The Mississippi amends
the Carver and the bends
This land is yours; this land is mine.
My brother punches my ear.
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad; I call my dad.
We skip inside of the store
the Mason winter door
This land is yours; this land is mine.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can,
ransacks with the mad man.
For this land is not yours or mine to have.
This land was made for the good of itself.)",2006,happy
Freckles,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/freckles.html,"I used to care so much about what others think about
Almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark
On the journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
If I knew then what I know now
I would have told myself don't worry any longer it's OK

[Chorus:]
'cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable,
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me
Sometimes I still feel like the little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm getting better
And I'm reminding myself

[Chorus]

Reflecting who you are
Reflecting who you are
Hmmm
Whoooooo whoa hmmmm oooooo

On a cold, rainy, windy night
She shut all the doors, she cut off the lights
She holds me and squeeze me tight
She tells me, ""Big O, everything's all right""

And I go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Play it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Do it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Come on now those happy songs, happy, happy songs

Come on
Bring my breakfast to the table
When I go to work she knows I'm able
Do my job, I come back in
You oughta see my baby's face, she just grins, grins, grins

I go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Play it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum

I'm All Over It,Jamie Cullum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiecullum/imalloverit.html,"Hello Innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing
How I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one
And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please

Let me go
Don't you know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I tried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

She's a melody
That I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me
When I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't fight
That song going round in my head
Like the last things you said

Please don't go
You think I know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change but I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back

One dark morning
She left without a warning
And took the red-eye back to London town

I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now

I'm all over it now

Yeah you

You had a dark, sexy vibe about ya
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about ya
As if you really didn't give a-unh!
I told myself not to fall for you
'Cause I can see that you don't follow rules
I should've just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on

It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

A real rebel kinda fella
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a-hey!
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls though they try
It's if they just can't stay away

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on

Driving fast, you had to try it

Girls they want to watch them ride

Cause I don't remember
Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember

We felt like fighters when we caught the plane
Until that day we'd never heard its name
We did some things we didn't understand
And now we feel like strangers in our own land

Girls they want to watch them fight

Headstart For Happiness,The Style Council,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stylecouncil/headstartforhappiness.html,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.",1983,happy

Or New York or Santa Fe

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Don't Deconstruct,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/dontdeconstruct.html,"Something is changing inside of me
Colors seem darker in light
And i don't know what that means
But it's not a good sign

You can just add them upthen you could memorize prehistoric bones
All of those old memories you can push them out and prep yourself for brand new information

Don't deconstruct and then fill me in
I'm not that basic i swear
I've had enough of break downs and diagrams

Judging from picture books apparently heaven is a partly cloudy place
And if the sky opened up and they let you in and gave you a formal invitation
Would you go?
You can work for home",2001,happy
Better Make It Better,Swing Out Sister,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/swingoutsister/bettermakeitbetter.html,"Take it fast, take is slow
But it won't soften the blow
When it's time to go
May be old, may be scared
But you'll never be prepared
For that final blow

Better use your wits or you'll lose your mind...
There's a world to discover and you're running
Out of time
Life's a roller coaster ride
That took you by surprise
Now you're burnin' up inside

Better make it better
Better make it better
Better make it better
'Cause time is running out fast

You can scream you can shout
But when your time runs out
Deep inside you'll know
May be rich, may be poor
But when you knock at Heaven's door
Well you have to go

Make the most of what you've got
For it's better than to not have anything at all
Take each day as it's your last
Or you'll find the future's passed and you're left
With nothing at all

Better make it better
Better make it better
Better make it better

Know we won't drown

Dog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and me

No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone

Dreaming again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes

All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)
Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""

Dreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbed
(Long dead rows of daffodils and marigolds)
Changing her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said,

Sometimes I wake up feeling crabby, she gives me love as sweet as candy.

It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, every time I see my little boy child.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, sometimes I even jump for joy, child.
He knows just how to make me happy, he gives me loves and calls me Daddy.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, c'mon giggle for me.

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall. It just blows me away to be part of it all.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, just singing these love songs for you.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, there ain't nothing that I'd rather do.
I like to see you with a smile on your face, I'd like to give one to the whole human race

Cupid,Sam Cooke,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/samcooke/cupid.html,"Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, if your arrow make her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid
Don't you hear me
Calling you?
I need you
Cupid
Help me
I need you
Cupid
Don't fail me",ompi,happy
Oslo In The Summertime,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/oslointhesummertime.html,"Oslo in the summertime; nobody can fall asleep, staring out the window from my bed.
At 4 A.M., the sun is up. Look, the sky is peppered with sea birds and with crows all cackling.

Up in treten Heimdalsgate, me and Nina making fun of footballers in Rudolf Nilsen Plass.
I practice my Norwegian on poor befuddled waitresses, who shake their heads completely at a loss.
Oslo in the summertime -- the streets are strangely quiet 'cause everyone's away on holiday.

Oslo in the summertime; Pakistani children play locked inside of the courtyard all day.
Pretty people everywhere, sun-lamp tans and flaxen hair -- just tell the American not to stare.",2005,happy

I'll admit I am bored with me
I drowned my sorrows and slept around
When not in body at least in mind
We'll find a cathedral city
You can convince me I am pretty

We'll pick berries and recline
Let's hit the road dear friend of mine
Wave goodbye to our thankless jobs
We'll drive for miles maybe never turn off
We'll find a cathedral city you can be handsome I'll be pretty

What does this city have to offer me?
Everyone else thinks it's the bee's knees
What does this city have to offer me?
I just can't see
I just can't see

Let's get out of this country
I have been so unhappy
Smell the Jasmine my head was turned
I feel like getting confessional
We'll find a cathedral city you can convince me I am pretty

These things they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me

It's all the same, save the shame for me
Left me to love

Brighter Than Sunshine,Aqualung,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aqualung/brighterthansunshine.html,"I never understood before.
I never knew what love was for.
My heart was broke, my head was sore -

I didn't believe in destiny.
I look up, you're standing next to me -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine,
Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine;
And it's brighter than sunshine.

I never saw it happening.
I'd given up and given in.
I just couldn't take the hurt again -
What a feeling.

I didn't have the strength to fight.
Suddenly, you seemed so right.
Me and you -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -

Love will remain a mystery,
But give me your hand, and you will see.
Your heart is keeping time with me.

Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.

Lost in the ether with no one to blame

Sad and delicate,

Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,

Sing like you think no one's listening,

Circles,Soul Coughing,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulcoughing/circles.html,"When you were languishing in rooms I built to file you in

Walk around in circles, walk around in

Walk around in circles, walk around in

And when the ghostly dust of violence traces everything
And when the gas runs out, just wreck it, you insured the thing

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in
I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in

But I can't sigh now that you made the move
It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star

A Malibu and Coke for you, a G&T for me

my life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill

For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time
and there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
self-control and self-abuse

We're overrated, anyway.

We're kissing without kissing... got it down to a fine art.
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky; we grew up and wide apart.
Not now, not ever, no... it's never a good time.
How will the good times ever roll along?
Comparing photos then and now.
Just wondering...wondering...where it all went wrong.

To the cave where I'd hide you in linens and frames

If I sliced you up real itty bitty

You're all Jenny and Lyndsay and fine
And I'm underwater, I'm shedding my mind
And I'm pretty sure, baby, if you'd hold my head
I could live like I've wished for and undo my dread
Cause I see candygrams up in the ceiling tiles
Witty postcards sent off from the sandwich aisles
And these towns where vacations will lead us
I'll hold out my treasures and their welfare feed us
But oh she does what she wishes
And, no, she won't be your missus
The kingdom it widens and no, they're alone with all that love and the void on your throne

Horchata,Vampire Weekend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vampireweekend/horchata.html,"In December drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

(Whoaaaaa ooooh)

In December drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

(Whoaaaaaa ooooh)

You'd remember drinkin horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on masada

Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Ooh you had it but oh no you lost it
Lookin back you shouldn't have fought it

In December, drinkin horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Falling down and nearing the rose beds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh you had it but oh no you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on",2010,happy
San Francisco,Foxygen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/foxygen/sanfrancisco.html,"Up in the San Francisco where the forest meets the bridge
I thought I saw you standing there and then you fell into the well
But that was many years ago and I am so much older now
My brother is a soldier now
I can't see them anyhow, I moved up in the wind
And you swimming up tide or just tuning in radio stations

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in a field
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

And we're restating on this hill
That Jesus came from Israel
Isaac followed the sacred cow
So not to wake a sparrow splashing mud

But that was many years from now
And I hope from here on now
That I always seem to want to shout
Your eyes are like a cup of tea
You're sending to the sun with me

You swimming upstream or just tune into new sensations
I was broken, you were broken

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

Birds of a Feather,Phish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phish/birdsofafeather.html,"It's easy sometimes when you just coast along
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
Of ritual drumming although at first glance
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance

It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
They hang on emotions they bottle inside
They peck at the ground
And strut out of stride",1998,happy

So clear but so unheard

It's just a matter of time

To appear sad
With the same old decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Lost and loaded
Still the same old decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate

Roam through the streets
And coffee shops
Their prey gather in herds
Of stiff knee-length skirts
And white ankle socks
But while they search for a mate
My type hibernate
In bedrooms above
Composing their songs of love

Young, uniform minds
In uniform lines
And uniform ties
Run round with trousers on fire
And signs of desire
They cannot disguise
While I try to find words
As light as the birds
That circle above
To put in my songs of love

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you have time
Let the sun shine down from above
And fill you with songs of love
Take me

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So let's sing while we still can
While the sun hangs high up above
Wonderful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love",1996,happy

The Good Left Undone,Rise Against,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/riseagainst/thegoodleftundone.html,"In fields where nothing grew but weeds,
I found a flower at my feet,
Bending there in my direction,
I wrapped a hand around its stem,
I pulled until the roots gave in,
Finding there what I'd been missing,

But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

Inside my hands these petals browned,
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now.
I pushed my fingers through the earth,
Returned this flower to the dirt,
So it could live. I walked away now.

But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long,
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

All because of you...
All because of you...

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
Inside these arms of yours.

All because of you,
I believe in angels.
Not the kind with wings,
No, not the kind with halos,
The kind that bring you home,
When home becomes a strange place.

All you have to do is shout it out.",2006,happy

So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969,happy
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/maninashed.html,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969,happy

Little sheep, don't let your feet stray

Guilt upon their shoulders
How well the cause evades
Infecting your religions, claiming pacts

Happiness is easy

To recognize excuse before it acts
From love & conviction to pray

On anyone for anything,
So you make your complaints,
And all everyone's let you down,
You just cant,
Ever win,
Convinced there's a war on,
It's always everybody versus you,
Convinced that your critics are watching,
And you've always got something,
You've always got something to prove,

So tie the noose,
And raise the cross,
The martyr's arrived,
A desperate plea for sympathy,
It's all you'll need,

A laundry list of problems,
Doesn't make you interesting,
And never getting help doesn't make you brave,
Not listening to reason doesn't mean that you have faith,
Your just cutting off your nose to spite your face,

So tie the noose,
And raise the cross,
The martyr's arrived,
A desperate plea for sympathy,
It's all you'll need!

And you want it all
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all.",2004,happy

Landlords Knocking at my door cussing me out
Got laid off my job the night before
Canât figure how
Iâm gonna fix tomorrow when Yesterday's still a mess
Can you tell me whatâs the point man
It all seems meaningless
I wish that I could step away and breathe
This worldâs trying to swallow me
Clear away the clouds inside my head

[Chorus:]
Someone just tell me
That itâs ok now
What are you worrying about

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When thereâs so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy

People lie, people hide, people cry, people fight

And they donât know why
If fear is all that we should fear
Then what are we so afraid of
'Cause fear is only in our heads

Someone please say...

[Chorus]

Any day I'll go bad thinking bad
Everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
During my stressing Iâm blinded to the lessons 
That could be a blessing if Id be confessing that the enemy
Iâm trying to beat is hiding inside of me

But itâs ok now...what are you worrying about...

Keep your grind on girl...itâs your love, itâs your world... [Repeat 2x]

If Not for You,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/ifnotforyou.html,"If not for you, babe, I couldn't find the door
Couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue if not for you.

If not for you, baby, I'd lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it will not be new if not for you.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
Oh what would I do if not for you ?

If not for you, winter would have no spring

I just wouldn't have a clue

Dispatch the Troops,Matisyahu,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/dispatchthetroops.html,"Daughter of Zion
Once precious princess
Left her father's house
To walk the streets that never rest
Maybe they'll hear me in the metropolis
So I'm sending out and SOS
Fighting with her ""ta""
She wants out of this mess
And those big city lights
Might brighten up the darkness
You know that I'm tired and you know that I'm stressed
You can't stop me and you can't stop this
You could call the police try to make an arrest
Today is the day that repossess
Leaving on the first bus that I can get
Now its rings around the eyes sopping wet from rain droplets
Window shopping for some solace
No address and penniless
Thats the price you pay from running away from the stress
Feeling the pain likes the dance by the DJ
Reminds me of a time when things were OK
Frightened by her own shadow
Now she wants to go home
Many names for one God
Trotting on through the facade
You were all my children
Got a dig for that feeling
Love will break through the concealment
Strip away the serpents skin
We came to win
Dispatch the troops
Send out the captain
My gem is held captive in the dungeon
Don't come back again until you end the mission
If it takes a long time
Don't lose the vision
If you're stuck
Check the blueprint
Look within
Reflection
Got to find the rhythm
Won't you please return child
Where you been?
She says I can't come home because he won't let me in
And besides we don't need no more friction
Used to look so nice how'd you get so thin?
With a heart of ice it's a heart of sin
Skin white like a ghost with a pale complexion
Pray to God for the dead we need resurrection
Don't you know wherever you go thick and thin
You are still my children
Since you've been gone my soul's been hearting
Wondering through this world
We are all just boys and girls
Many names for God
Trotting on through the facade",2006,happy

And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Let me take you there

North of the river all the streets are the same
We can pretend that they don't know our name
And the heat is turned all the way to full
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
I really knew you

We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

I am trying to say
What I want to say

Springs comes in when I'm rolling up another one
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun

Three blues, two greens and a beer...

Do You Believe In Magic,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

And the market stalls are all filling up, spilling over the streets.
High above, over Notting Hill-
I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh-
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends-
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

[Chorus x2]

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.
Yeah we will unravel, unravel the moments.

Oh...

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will come to your window.

I Just Wanna Run,The Downtown Fiction,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/downtownfiction/ijustwannarun.html,"I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down

Run before they're finding me out

I'm out here all alone
I try to call your house
Can't reach you on the phone
I'll gather up the nerve
I'm packing up my bag
It's more than you deserve
Don't treat me like a drag

I'm repeating myself
My words lost all meaning

Run before they're finding me out

I predict your move
I think I know you better
Better than you do

Cheated and abused
Sick of losing sleep
Thinking about you

Act Naturally,Buck Owens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/buckowens/actnaturally.html,"They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally

Well, I bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well.

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally.

We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally.

Well, I bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell

Romance your ego for a while

Tatters,Lou Reed,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loureed/tatters.html,"Some couples live in harmony
some do not
Some couples yell and scream
some do not

But what you said was something
that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not

Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters

But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
I suppose that we all could say
that nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
to see everything in tatters",2000,happy

The fool in me
It's like a dream, you see
But if the world is right
I'll drive all night
And meet you there someday

Six in the morning, never felt so sweet
Just put on Lucinda baby, and dance with me
I know I'm hard to count on
Forget half what I'm told
You probably only know my voice from
A goddam microphone

It's a waste
A teenage taste of me
But if Daddy cries
Just say goodnight
And I'll come
If I could change
I'd keep away the rain
And the sun would shine every night
And I'll come meet you there someday...

The Space Between,Valencia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/valencia/thespacebetween.html,"There's something strange going on in my head
That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing, so stare up at the clouds
And at least you know you're always looking up

So Casey can you remember (Do you remember)
Sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
And talking about life

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we'd stay inside just to watch the time go by
And sleep the whole day till the night
With everything you said
I'm sure you've got some place that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song and thinking about me

Carolina was waiting for you
It's what you always wanted

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away
Cause the sky looks different when you're in another state
It's everything I've always wanted
And everything I've worked so hard for

Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?
Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?

Well is it in me

The blood red on an empty street
It's not night, it's not day
It's no more, for an unfortunate soul who
Witnessed his life violently erased, 
From the horror of the human race
Bright futures exchanged for profit, living half alive

Because in death as in life

Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!

In life now pay respects to your blood
Those in the vast of the great
Unknown, unite there, your heart's one 
in moments you'll never forget, yeah
History lessons direct from the grave
Lost souls of the lost divide
Liberate your generation, living, rotting flesh

Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life

Call out tyranny!
A spark of dissent can light a fury of flame
Call out to be free!

Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation

Strip away! Be the voice of a generation
Strip away! You've got a choice to make
Cut away! Cut away!

It's a last chance, when they've given up
It's a bad ride, falling out of love
Can you take it?
'cause I can't take it...

When the rain starts shaking the ground
I hope that you're ready now.
I hope you're ready for it when you
Get caught out in the rain. I hope you're ready now
For all the storms to head your way

It's a long drive, when you've got no gas
It's a cheap date, when you're out of cash
It's a bad day, another bad day
It's a feeling, when you've lost your touch
It's a plane ride, if on the right drugs
And can you take it?
Honestly, I can't take it...

When the rain starts shaking the ground
I hope that you're ready now
I hope that you're ready for it when you
Get caught out in the rain. I hope you're ready now

We'll find ourselves inside the raindrops
We'll fight the seconds inside every clock
What's keeping you from leaving?

Get out save yourself before we're burning in hell
When sun is what you're chasing
But everyday is raining
Pockets full of silver dimes

She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be

She's just another girl (another girl)

I went to see a fortune teller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

The inside jokes and the changing style.

But when I'm here,
I leave behind,
What I don't need
'Cause everytime I walk these streets I know they're mine.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything's ok.""

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Your faded signs,
Your tiny crime,
Your endless jokes that go on for miles

Your errant daughter,
Walks on water,
You wouldn't have a word said against her.

But I agree,
The factories,
The shopping carts sing a symphony,
That sounds like home to me.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything's ok.""

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Oooooooooooo,
Oooooooooooo.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything will be okay.""

These streets of nowhere!

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere",2010,happy

Are so cute that I'm happy

Who only chase after that
They are truly unhappy

Happy things and great things
That it's been a while since we stopped caring about
Money and power

I just do what I want to do
If you just worry and become an adult
You'll have regrets

My journal is filled with adventures to find happiness

I'm happy that she ran over to me
And linked her arm in mine with a smile
The groups of boys who are always joking around
I'm happy that they pay attention
When I pass them

She may nag
But my mom says she loves me the most in this world
Hey hey, take out
Those adults who only fight on TV

I like it more and more
I'm happy that I'm me
What makes me even happier
Is that you're next to me

Drying dishes turning twisting until we can run out go swimming
I feel you behind me ringing bowls right next to my ears
Toe was so clear so that we all could hear when the water washed around us
Salty holding us steer

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

Skinny skinny skinny man with a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast to be swallowed let it last

I'm swimming with all my slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting
Limbs clenched so hard, mouth so resistant

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

All I want from you is a letter and to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time",2014,happy

It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

Wanna find somebody
Not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Little aimless

Humming,Turnover,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/turnover/humming.html,"Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young.
Positively unattached, 
Naive and unattracted to the buzz.
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song.
Show me why you're always smiling.
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space.
Drawn outside the lines,
your words, a vibrant illustration you create.

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole,
Deep down into an old slope.
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go,
Spinning out of control

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

I don't feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion fruit and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her here she comes

She bangs the drums

The Magic Number,De La Soul,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delasoul/themagicnumber.html,"(Got to have soul!) 

[POS:]
3 
That's the Magic Number 
Yes it is 
It's the magic number 
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community 
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me 
And that's the magic number 

(What does it all mean?) 

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
Measure in my music, raised in three parts 
Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky 
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires 
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet 
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

Everybody wants to be a deejay 
Everybody wants to be an emcee 
But being speakers are the best 
And you don't have to guess 
De La Soul posse consists of three 
And that's the magic number 

[DOVE:]
This here piece of the pie 
Is not dessert but the course that we dine 
And three out of every darn time 
The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind 
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
When that negative number fills up the casualty 
Maybe you can subtract it 
You can call it your lucky partner 
Maybe you can call it your adjective 
But odd as it may be 
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
My 3 
Mase Pos and Me 
And that's the Magic Number 

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
Time is a factor so it's time to count 
Count not the negative actions of one 
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 

Now you may try to subtract it 
But it just won't go away 
Three times one? 
(What is it?) 
(One, two, three!) 
And that's the Magic Number 

(Yo, what's up?) 
(1, 2, 3) 
(I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
(I wouldn't lie to you) 
(No more no less, that's the magic number) 
(No more no less) 
(What it is?) 
(No more no less) 
(Is this the future?) 
(No more no less) 
(Do the shang-a-lang) 
(No more no less) 
(No one on the subway ever chats to me) 
(No more no less) 
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(Three feet high and rising) 
(No more no less) 
(Three)

You got nothing better to do

And just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm

To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
Traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
'Cos he's fucking up even the simplest lines
They say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the streets I'll be the only shit that's left behind

Saint Noni wise and heart-strong
Often said to Rainbowarrior
""O my brother, do not leave me!
Lest the evil spirits harm you!""
Rainbowarrior of two spirits
Gentle hand and lion-hearted
He laughed and then he answered
Like a child he softly whispered:

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears

He's dead, our sweetest mother
Loving father and our teacher
He's gone forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the master of all laughter
To the master of all song
O my brother, O my brother
Crystal brother of two spirits
Then we gathered in a circle
Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning ember's hearts united
We remember mystical beauty
If you look hard you can find a
Rainbow trail it's deep inside ya
Fear not you're a Rainbowarrior
Golden light on everything gleaming

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears",2007,happy
Fortress,Pinback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinback/fortress.html,"Too long til fall, sick summer in bed
You and a lazy mood
Ten times the fall, spread, sacked, and I've failed
Nobody move, nobody move

To long to fall
Sat shiver in bed
You and a test of will
Too many fallen, too many failed
Nobody move, nobody move

Days with the light off, freezing
You and I, uneasy, livid

Stop, it's too late
I'm feeling frustrated
I see no sign of fortress
I see no sign of fortress

Safe as a cootie wootie with you
Never pretend the chill
Too many shadows, too many sails
Nobody move, nobody move

Summer is only winter with you
How can you really feel?
Two of another, none of a pair
Nobody move, nobody move

Days with the light off, freezing
You and I, uneasy, livid

Stop, it's too late
I'm feeling frustrated
I see no sign of fortress
I see no sign of fortress

Another delay, too many hassles
Where do we go, how do we follow?",2004,happy

Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
to a cat named Frankenstein

Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh)

It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money

Heart Attack,Sum 41,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sum41/heartattack.html,"Remember when there was nothing else to do,
But lie in bed
And wonder how it was always up to you
And no one else.
And early mornings,
Made by warnings,
What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining,
I'm not complaining,
But waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay.
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day,
And we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say,
'Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring,
Slept in mornings,
Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming.
It's not important
If days are shortened.
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

What's a day
When it all ends up the same
And lasts forever?
Can't complain
When there's nothing there to blame,
And things can't be better.

Summer evenings,
Teenage grievings,
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration
On hesitation,
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do

So, turn my head it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day,

And you never, never, never, never, never give up

By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah",2009,happy

Satin in a Coffin,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/satininacoffin.html,"You were laying on the carpet

Are you dead or are you sleepin'? 
Are you dead or are you sleepin'? 
Are you dead or are you sleepin'? 
God I sure hope you are dead. 

Well you disappeared so often 
like you dissolved into coffee.

Are you dead or are you sleepin'? 
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?

Now the blow's been softened, 
since the air we breathe's our coffin. 
Well now the blow's been softened, 
since the ocean is our coffin. 
Often times you know our laughter 
is your coffin ever after. 
And you know the blow's been softened, 
since the world is our coffin. 
Well now the blow's been softened 
since we are our own damn coffins. 
Well everybody's talkin' about their short lists. 
Everybody's talkin' about death.

The General,Dispatch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dispatch/thegeneral.html,"there was a decorated general with
a heart of gold, that likened him to
all the stories he told
of past battles, won and lost, and
legends of old a seasoned veteran in
his own time

on the battlefield, he gained
respectful fame with many medals
of bravery and stripes to his name
he grew a beard as soon as he could
to cover the scars on his face
and always urged his men on

but on the eve of a great battle
with the infantry in dream
the old general tossed in his sleep
and wrestled with its meaning
he awoke from the night
just to tell what he had seen
and walked slowly out of his tent

all the men held tall with their
chests in the air, with courage in
their blood and a fire in their stare
it was a grey morning and they all
wondered how they would fare
till the old general told them to go home

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

but the men stood fast with their
guns on their shoulders not knowing
what to do with the contradicting orders
the general said he would do his own
duty but would extend it no further
the men could go as they pleased

but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
till one by one
they stepped back and not a word was said
and the old general was left with his
own words echoing in his head
he then prepared to fight

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting, no
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven, go

And of mathematics well I want none,

And all crossword puzzles well I just shun, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton,

And that's I love you. 

I'm not proud of the fact that I never learned much, 
Just feel I should say, 
what you get is all real, 
I can't put on an act, 
It takes brains to do that anyway. (And anyway...) 

And I can't unravel riddles, problems and puns, 
How the home computer has me on the run, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, 
But I know one thing, 
And that's I love you (I love you).

Of all the Nobel prizes that I've never won,

Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and bless my soul

Life Is Sweet,Natalie Merchant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nataliemerchant/lifeissweet.html,"It's a pity
It's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again? 
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside 

It's a pity
It's a downright crime
But it happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
Wanna hide from the vicious world outside 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

Your daddy he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied, 
And you know
That's not right 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 
It's high time that you decide
In your own mind 

Tried to comfort you
Tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind
They can't see 

Fortune gonna come some day
All gonna fade away
Your daddy the war machine and
Your mama the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she can not see 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 

It's high time you decide
It's time you make up your own sweet little mind 

They told you life is long
Be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more
You should be grateful 

But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know
It will be over 

Cause life is sweet
And life is also very short
Your life is sweet",1998,happy
No Other Way,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/nootherway.html,"When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break

All the words that we said
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake
Now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep,
It's all that we need
When we wake we would find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew all the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
'Cause we told each other, there is no other way",2005,happy

Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup

While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

This Side,Nickel Creek,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelcreek/thisside.html,"One day you'll see her and you'll know what I mean.
Take her or leave her she will still be the same.
She'll not try to buy you with her time.
But nothing's the same, as you will see when she's gone.

It's foreign on this side,
And I'll not leave my home again.
There's no place to hide
And I'm nothing but scared.

You dream of colors that have never been made,
You imagine songs that have never been played.
They will try to buy you and your mind.
Only the curious have something to find.

It's foreign on this side,
And the truth is a bitter friend.
But reasons few have I to go back again.

Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day.
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain.
There's no path to follow, once you're here.
You'll climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs.

It's foreign on this side,
But it feels like I'm home again.
There's no place to hide
But I don't think I'm scared.

Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again

Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by",1969,happy

Pudding's sweet

Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said

Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
Add a little lust
To the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space

Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

Don't ask me why

In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville

Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood

Sink in the city aquarium
Sing in the key of night

Make me somewhere I can call a home

Wrapped in silent elegance
Beautifully broken down
As illusions burst
Too late to learn from experience
Too late to wonder how
To finish first

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home

The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
In 4 parts without commercial interruptions
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon
Blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John
Mitchell, General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary

Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie
Wood and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia

The revolution will not get rid of the nubs
The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner

There will be no pictures of you and Willie May
Pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run
Or trying to slide that color TV into a stolen ambulance
NBC will not be able to predict the winner at 8:32
On reports from 29 districts

Wilkins strolling through Watts in a Red, Black and
Green liberation jumpsuit that he has been saving

Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville
Junction will no longer be so damned relevant, and

Jane on Search for Tomorrow because Black people
Will be in the street looking for a brighter day

News and no pictures of hairy armed women
Liberationists and Jackie Onassis blowing her nose

Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom
Jones, Johnny Cash, Engelbert Humperdinck, or The Rare Earth

The revolution will not be right back
After a message about a white tornado, white lightning, or white people
You will not have to worry about a dove in your
Bedroom, a tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl

The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath

Through the light
Of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down
To the river of sight

Red lights flashing
Through the window
In the rain

White cane lying
In a gutter in the lane

Time to Get Away,LCD Soundsystem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lcdsoundsystem/timetogetaway.html,"Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
You brought a lot of money
But me, I got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)
And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time we'll talk it over
And we can start again
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time let's talk about it
And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
(You know what I'm saying?) I knew you were low man,
But the truth is I was shocked
(Of) power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie.",2007,happy

Red Right Hand,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/redrighthand.html,"Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul,
but there won't be a single thing
that you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car? 
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand",1994,happy

You cannot bear
And I say gimme mine
Back and then go there
For all I care

So insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas
To wash down all this pride
First you run like a fool
Just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool
But you just run to hide
And I can't abide

I got my feet
On the ground

Don't be so sensitive
We're not playing
A game anymore
You don't have
To be so defensive
Don't you plead me your case
Don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face
'Cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock
From under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave
And all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame

I got my feet
On the ground
And I don't go
To sleep to dream
You got your head
In the clouds and
You're not at all

Admit we went too far
And you won't see me change my mind
But I really wish that I
Could forget the way you are

[B-section 2]
But you left this feeling here inside me
The battle in my mind still fights me

I can see that you're not beside me
But I still feel you shine inside of me",2006,happy
Night Time,The xx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xx/nighttime.html,"You mean that much to me
And it's hard to show
Gets hectic inside of me
When you go
Can I confess these things
To you
Well I don't know
Embedded in my chest
And it
Hurts to hold

I couldn't spill my heart
My eyes gleam looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather
Hold my words, keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip

Night time
Sympathize
I've been working on
White lies
So I'll tell the truth
I'll give it up to you
And when the day comes
It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon

And I couldn't spill my heart
My eyes gleam
Looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather
Hope my words keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip

Night time
Sympathize
I've been working on
White lies
So I'll tell the truth
I'll give it up to you
And when the day comes
It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon",2009,happy
Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then),The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/yankeebayonetiwillbehomethen.html,"[Soldier:]
Heart-carved tree trunk, Yankee bayonet
A sweetheart left behind

[Girl:]
Far from the hills and the sea-swelled Carolinas
That's where my true love lies

[Soldier:]
Look for me when the sun-bright swallow
Sings upon the birch bough high

[Girl:]
But you are in the ground with the wolves and the weevils
All a-chew upon your bones so dry

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave?
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
Then

[Girl:]
When I was a girl how the hills of Oconee
Made a seam to hem me in

[Soldier:]
There at the fair when our eyes caught, careless
Got my heart right pierced by a pin

[Soldier:]
But O did you see all the dead of Manassas
All the bellies and the bones and the bile?

[Girl:]
No, I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with child

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then

[Soldier:]
Stems and bones and stone walls too
Could keep me from you
This skein of skin is all too few
To keep me from you

[Soldier and Girl:]
But O my love though our bodies may be parted
Though our skin may not touch skin
Look for me with the sun-bright sparrow
I will come on the breath of the wind",2006,happy

Doing the things a particle can
What's he like? It's not important

Or does the water get him instead?
Nobody knows, Particle man

Triangle man hates particle man

Size of the entire universe man
Usually kind to smaller man

He's got a watch with a minute hand,
Millenium hand and an eon hand
When they meet it's a happy land
Powerful man, universe man

Person man, person man
Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can
Person man

Is he depressed or is he a mess?
Does he feel totally worthless?
Who came up with person man?
Degraded man, person man

If you don't have a date
Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do
Nobody does it anymore

No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine

If you don't have a point to make
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine",2005,happy

Being male, middle-class and white

It's so intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white-boy pain
Shake your booty while the band complains

I'm p*ssed off but I'm too polite

Mom and Dad you made me so uptight
I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight

I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate

Sendin' dirty vibes my way

Made someones' great great great great Grandaddies slaves

One Four Five,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/onefourfive.html,"Listen doctor I have pain 
That grows inside myself 
Shelf me please 
I just can't ease the pain 
I need some drugs to help 
Ah pollution fills my lungs 
And convolution fills my mind 
Ah my legs do ache 
I contemplate 
That living's less than fine 
My spine does tingle 
When I think of being 
Freed from this curse 
But what is worse I feel 
Life is a bubble 
Blown until it's burst 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
To get rid of this feeling 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
For some good soul healing 

The doctor turned and gave a grin 
And reached into his bag 
But instead of an injection 
Got a record with a tag 
That said listen to this daily 
With hip shaking and such things 
Then he puts the record on 
Grabs a mic and starts to sing 
You need some 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
To make you high to make you high 
When heaven falling from the sky 
To make you high to make you high 

Doctor I am feeling better 
What was that you sang 
Did you write it or recite it 
Or just steal it from a band 
Ah my bones are feeling stronger 
And my spirit's feeling fresh 
Ah that dose of 145 has put the life 
Back in my breath 
'yes yes yes' the doctor said 
Then he sat me down and say 
'young man don't think I wrote 
These chords they're written in 
Your brain' 
And when you hear them 
There's a shakedown that begins within 
The mind 
Cos these three chords make people 
Feeling better all the time ah 
They keep repeating 
Like a scratch on a cd 
But it's quality cos these three harmonies 
Breed positivity 
Protecting against insanity 
Of modern insecurities 
Believe me when I tell you 
All you need is to be hearing all that 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
To make you high to make you high 
When they said what and you said why 
To make you high to make you high 

The doctor turned and gave a grin 
And reached into his bag

Got a record with a tag

Grabs a mic and starts to sing 
You need some 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
When you could not count to pi 
When you're told you can't fly 
To make you high to make you high 

Times like these you need some

The Mariner's Revenge Song,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/themarinersrevengesong.html,"We are two mariners
Our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs are ceiling beams
Its guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you
And I will relay to you
How our histories interweave

At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease

As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind

Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried,
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat

But never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty

The following day
I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind
I could almost hear
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea:
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed.""

And then, that fateful night,
We had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath

The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale
(oh, oh)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive as well as me

It gives my heart great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(oh, oh)",2005,happy

Because all the names and places I have taken from real life
So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right...",2003,happy

What's that? Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait, wait a minute

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya dont stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Black Friday Rule,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/blackfridayrule.html,"I want to believe in myself once again 
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end 
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you 
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye 
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy 
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold 
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane 
Flew all the way to California 
This mess in my head is a mess getting out 
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry 
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine 
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed 
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still 
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill 
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe 
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

So I must remain in my new adopted land 
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can 
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name 
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

True Affection,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/trueaffection.html,"I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Down to the bottom

I wanted a junction and often there was one
You'd surfaced face-first and we'd
Share thought bubbles and
I still believe in the phrases that we breathed
But I know the distance isn't fair to cross

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

Your depths made a pressure that
Punctured my works and all your fluids couldn't tolerate the
Force of my thirst
I love the place where we shared our tiny grace
But just because its real don't mean its gonna work

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

And true affection floats
True affection sinks
Like a stone
I never felt so close
I never felt so all alone

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections

What are you made of
What are you so afraid of
Could it be
Three simple words
Or the fear of being overheard
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

Secret Heart
Why so mysterious
Why so sacred
Why so serious
Maybe you're
Just acting tough
Maybe you're just not bad enough
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
You're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel

Secret heart come out and share it
This loneliness, few can bear it
Could it have something to do with
Admitting that you just can't go through it alone

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
That you're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel
This very secret
Go out and share it

Ghost of Corporate Future,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/ghostofcorporatefuture.html,"A man walks out of his apartment,
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings,
Trying to save his suit,
Trying to save his suit.
Trying to dry, and to dry, and to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform,
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""
Everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""

But he doesn't care,
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Ghost of Corporate Future
The ghost said, ""Take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet.""

He also said,
""Imagine you go away
On a business trip one day
And when you come back home,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan.""

""And people make you nervous
You'd think the world is ending,
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic,
And everyone's sarcastic,
And all your food is frozen,
It needs to be defrosted.""

""You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.""

""Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee,
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news,
Maybe you should kiss someone nice,
Or lick a rock,
Or both.""

""Maybe you should cut your own hair
'Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead""

""And people are just people,
They shouldn't make you nervous.
The world is everlasting,
It's coming and it's going.
If you don't toss your plastic,
The streets won't be so plastic.
And if you kiss somebody,
Then both of you'll get practice.""

""The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
And take off both your shoes.
'Cause people are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.
People are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.""

The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going

Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/goodoldfashionedloverboy.html,"I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things

Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned loverboy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, ooh, can you feel my love heat?

And tell me how do you feel right after all

Say the word, your wish is my command

When I'm not with you, think of me always

Hey, boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned

Dining at The Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely

I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)

Salty Dog,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/saltydog.html,"I'll wait for you till I turn blue 
There's nothin' more a man can do 
Don't get your bollocks in a twist 
Settle down, don't take a fit 
Ya drank with demons straight form Hell 
They almost nearly won as well 
Ya wiped the floor with victory 
Then puked until you fell asleep

Blackened was the banshee's wail 
These boot will never fill her jail 
So you crawled into an empty boat 
For the Gulf of Mexico 
Till Cortez came an' when so did you 
From the ashes charred and blue 
Smellin' like a Salty Dog 
Back from Hell where you belong

Anarchy, the scourge of every sea 
The Antichrist aboard a rig 
With us your cutthroat thieves 
The ship went down we all near drowned 
Ya stood there on the deck 
Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse 
And dragged you from the wreck

They threw a rope around yer neck 
To watch you dance the jig of death 
Then left ya for the starvin' crows 
Hoverin' like hungry whores 
One flew down plucked out yer eye 
The other he had in his sights 
Ya snarled at him, said leave me be 
I need the bugger so I can see",2000,happy

Life on Mars?,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/lifeonmars.html,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say

Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude,
over my head

Walking In Memphis,Marc Cohn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marccohn/walkinginmemphis.html,"Put on my blue suede shoes and
I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
And she's down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian, child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight!""

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Boarded the plane

Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over

From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustling, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them

tied up to my feet 
I leaned instead of jiggie

that has failed in so many ways of life 
To trust its stories 
you've got to be dull as them 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah, yeah!!! 

I met her in a crowded room 
where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand 
I watched her beauty from an armchair 
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film 
with those kids in New York in the eighties 
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway""

Half Asleep,School of Seven Bells,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/schoolofsevenbells/halfasleep.html,"Sometimes I go whole days
listening bored, half asleep
I won't say anything
that's worth a thing to me
One day, suddenly, time
took a turn that once felt so brief
I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly

What begins as an unguarded
train of thought slowly can become
an addiction to the slumber
of disconnection and the resonance
of memory that no longer has a shape
but keeps you numb through
the hours till gone is another day

Be aware, my darling
these things I say I mean
are just traces of something
I long to feel again
I see our time expand
in the air almost forcibly,
spreading thinner till it dissolves completely",2008,happy
Golden Touch,Razorlight,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/razorlight/goldentouch.html,"I know a girl with the golden touch
She's got enough, she's got too much

You could have it all if it mattered so much

When you're there, they're your friend
But then when you're not around
They say, ""Oh, she's changed""
We know what they mean
Well they mean, they're just jealous
Because they never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well

That kind of girl, yes she's never alone
You leave a thousand messages on her phone
But you know you never get through
And you could have it all if you wanted, girl
You could have it all if it matters to you

Give me a taste but not too much
I never listen to the words of fools
Well, well, hey, you
You won't get it that way
But don't ask for too much
You're gonna need your golden touch

When you're there, they're your friend

You're still driving my car
Sticks and stones break my bones

I'm all alright

Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well...

Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring

Apples In The Trees,Mirah,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mirah/applesinthetrees.html,"There should be no hesitation 
When the coast is clear 
You got a right to slide 
Right into place when the end is almost here 

So you think you got some rotten deal 
What a way to compromise 
It's a long long way 
Before you get to claim that final prize 

Looking at that sorry face 
I can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night 
The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me, 
There's food for you 
There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide 
And there is love beyond compare 

There's apple in the trees 
Let's take all that we need 
We know what we believe 
There's hope for you and me 
My eyes can almost see 
If you fight 'til you're free 
You don't have to wait until you die",2001,happy
Dreams Never End,New Order,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neworder/dreamsneverend.html,"My promise could be your fiend
A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In it's escapable view
There's no escape so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see
But never guess how the him would scream
But never guess how the him would scream
But never guess how the him would scream",1981,happy

I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Yeah, should've smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on

Crying Shame,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/cryingshame.html,"It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?
Of sight, out of mind now

By now we should know
How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning under the same sun?
By now we say it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really wanna play?

We could close our eyes, it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we gonna blame now?

And, oh, it's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home

I can close my eyes, it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I can close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all

It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
And who we gonna blame on and on?

Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Funny how it's hard to take a love with no sting.

But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me 
But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me (we`ve got a good life).

What can I compare you to, a window the sun shines through? 
Maybe the silver moon, a smile rising
The magic of the fading day, satellites on parade
A toast to the plans we've made to live like kings.

I lose my breath despite the air
When the rain falls down I give in to despair
Pink magnolia in winter she doesn't care 
if you don't show up to have another cup.

What can I compare you to, when everything looks like you? 
I get a bit confused with every Spring
Flowers that bloom your eyes, hummingbirds side by side
My heart won't stay entirely in this rib caging",2006,happy

Shoes beget to clothes and hat 'til sticky's sticking too 

Finiculi finicula finiculi finicula 

Listen in as shin-kicked Jim relates his story sad 
About a boy who kicked until his shins were all but rubberbands 
But now 

I know New York I need New York 
I know I need unique New York

And whatever differences our lives have been 
We together make a limb""

You never knew cause he was dead 
And how his face was carved an ripped with wrinkles 
In the picture in your head 
And remember how you found the key 
To his hide-out in the Pyrenees, 
But you wanted to keep his secret safe, 
So you threw the key away? 
This is the story of your gypsy uncle 

This is the story of the boys who loved you 
Who love you now and loved you then 
And some were sweet and some were cold and snuffed you 
And some just layed around in bed 
And some, they crumbled you straight to your knees 
Did it cruel, did it tenderly 
Some they crawled their way into your heart 
To rend your ventricles apart

I'll await by the car and we'll go, we'll go

When first we laid eyes
I swore to no compromise
'Til I felt my caress on your skin

Your sister gave us away
And your father came all unhinged

With your blood still warm on the ground
Valencia!
And I swear to the stars
I'll burn this whole city down

All I heard was the shout
Of your brother calling me out
And you ran like a fool to my side

Well, the shot, it hit hard
And your frame went limp in my arms
And an oath of love was your dying cry

So await for the stone on your window, your window
I'll await by the car and we'll go, we'll go

Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/hereidreamtiwasanarchitect.html,"And here I dreamt I was a soldier
And I marched the streets of Burkenau
And I recall in spring
The perfume that the air would bring
To the indolent town
Where the barkers call the moon down
The carnival was ringing loudly now
And just to lay with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And I am nothing of a builder
But here I dreamt I was an architect
And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world
But the angles and the corners
Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And here in Spain I am a Spaniard
I will be buried with my marionettes
Countess and courtesan
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
While you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seat belts on
We live this close to death

And try one, and try two

A Cautionary Song,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/acautionarysong.html,"There's a place your mother goes
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoats
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach

With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle
And she's laid in bed on the upper deck

And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Til at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions, and their opinions

And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her thirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed, and this is how you're fed

So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep",2002,happy

Camel in disrepair
Hoping for a Frigidaire to come passing by

Lacking my joie de vivre
Missing my gay Paree
In this desert dry

And I wrote my girl
Told her I would not return
I've terribly taken a turn
For the worse now, I fear

It's been a year or more
Since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war
So far away from my home

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again

La la la la dam
La la la low

Medicating in the sun
Pinch doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage!
A bottle of ancient Chiraz!
The smattering of distant applause
Is ringing in my poor ears

On the old left bank
My baby in a charabanc
Riding up the width and length
Of the Champs Elysee

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)

The Good Thing,Talking Heads,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/talkingheads/thegoodthing.html,"I will fight; will fight with my heart.

Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A straight line exists between me and the good things.
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.
So I say:
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.",1978,happy

Best to be dim to the humble of traffic stepping on your name

Count on us all falling our own swords tonight

And chilling walk home down the portions roads there leading straight to your place
And look like the tin can with swallows the kitchen plugging up your space

Count on us all stepping on our own toes tonight
Count on us all stepping on our own toes
Count on us all follow our own swords tonight",2006,happy
Another Girl,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/anothergirl.html,"For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you

I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, ""This time you'd better stop""

For I have got another girl, another girl
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me

And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall

Protected by a silver spoon

By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?

Shouldn't let you conquer me completely

Disassociate

Leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers
And watched my fears
Fly away

And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say
Sometimes she says she loves me not

But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today

We should be in harmony
Boy and girl

Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way

For love is blind and you're far too kind

They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars.

You'll have to learn, just like me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep

I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place

You held it in your hands
I had flashes

You saw the whole of the moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed and I tried
You just knew
I sighed
But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers, and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

Yes, you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon",1985,happy

To steal what she never could own

Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails
And fills up her brigantine sails

With a cigarette in hand and it's love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love

Staring at my shoes thinking of something to say
But nothing's better than what silence is saying
Every time I turn around
she's always looking away
It's just the nature of the game that we're playing

And I think I'm tapping out
I think I'm gonna skip the title bout

Yeah my baby's pretty as a car crash
Sexy as a stinger of a hornet in your arm
Just another modern swinger
Screaming ""catch me if you can""
With a cigarette in hand and it's love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love",2005,happy
Satisfied Mind,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/satisfiedmind.html,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had money, I would do things my way,""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

One thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind,
Satisfied mind.",1998,happy

Closer To Fine,Indigo Girls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/indigogirls/closertofine.html,"I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
It's only life after all

Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety 'til I sank it
I'm crawling on your shores

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

I stopped by the bar at 3 A.M
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain

We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain

We go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

All the birds of the air call your name as they land on my kitchen roof
All the fish in the lake do the same should you need extra proof

My vision is skewed
I'm stupidly happy
I'm coming unscrewed

And if the Devil walks up dressed in any disguise
I take him by the collars look him in the eye
I'm stupidly happy
Now you're my defence
I'm stupidly happy
This world's making sense

I'm stupidly happy
I roll like a train
I'm stupidly happy
With you in my brain

All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar
I'm a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are

I'm stupidly happy
Like the words to that song
I'm stupidly happy
No nothing not wrong
And should the Devil walk up with his business card out
I'll tear it to confetti with a grin and shout,

Happy Kid,Nada Surf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nadasurf/happykid.html,"I'm just a happy kid
Stuck with the heart of a sad punk
Drowning in my id
Always searching like it's on junk
No matter who i hang out with
I can hear the clack clunk
Of the chains that pull the cars up 
The roller coaster mountain top so high
When it comes down it shoots back up
Straight back to the sky
I gotta laugh and then i'm asleep 
And then i walk around and wanna cry
Out at night to do the strand
The little candles make the bottles glow
Got ink all over my right hand
Getting crushes with no chance to grow
It's like i'll never ever land
There's always too much sun 
Or too much snow
I get slow days and no days
I get rusty and it's hard
But i get notions that oceans 
Are coming to my call
You can learn to get along
I'm just a happy kid
Stuck with the heart of an old punk
Drowning in my id
Always hungry like it's on junk
I'm just a happy kid",2002,happy

The sights there are here to see
Only them will we finally revel in

Shouldn't be this hard to find

When I see the people standing there
Shy, cerebral in the lonely air
Disenchanted, stony eyes
Bored to tears, but dry inside

Farther on, they'll collide
Intimate, but still strangers
The dangers in each other's eyes

Where I had hidden myself somewhere in your charm
Our golden handshake has been smashed into this shape.

Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

We hunched together in one chair out on the deck
In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set
It looked as if I picked your name out of a hat
Next thing you know you are asleep in someone's lap
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

We quit the room
Quit so our thoughts could rest
Rest them, I'll never move?
That's when we grab a hold
Of whatever it is we fell into
Lousy with your content
With what the majestic cannot find
In business of your lives
The perception, it is wrong, mile after mile
The phantom taste drinking wine from your heels

On the charms of our idle dreary days
Seen the shadows grow
See an ominous display

I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.

Try and stop what we do

I am gonna have my chance

Summertime Clothes,Animal Collective,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animalcollective/summertimeclothes.html,"(Summer...)

Sweet summer night and I'm stripped to my sheets
Forehead is leaking, my AC squeaks
And a voice from the clock says, ""You're not gonna get tired""
My bed is a pool and the walls are on fire
Soak my head in the sink for a while
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you, we're going.

(I'm not sure where...
I'm not sure where, but I have seen you today)

It doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze, get a midnight meal
I point in the windows, you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard, smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go when our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yarn you'll be sleeping soon
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down, we'll go out again.

Don't cool off, I like your warmth.

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it whets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls, says that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you

Just you, just you, just you.",2009,happy

Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,

Please play me your second game,

I just need your star for a day

Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerers of death's construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning,
as you hear the bodies burning.
No more war pigs of the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.
Day of judgement, god is calling, 
on their knees the war pigs crawling.
Begging mercy for their sins,
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!",1989,happy

Open up my window

I lift my head
Blinded by the sky

Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Fall down to the ground

I know there's more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street

Gave my love to a shooting star

That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

When she falls then
I'll be waiting",2010,happy

Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers 
I see my own breath on the face of the door 

Oh I am not quite sleeping 
Oh I am fast in bed 
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping 
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched 

North of Savanna we swim in the palisades 
I come out wearing my brother's red hat 
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times 
He runs washing his face in his hands 

Oh how I meant to tease him 
Oh how I meant no harm 
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him 
I see the wasp on the length of my arm 

Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu- 
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu- 
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu- 
trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-

Into the car, from the back seat

All of my powers, day after day

Deep in the tower, the prairies below 
I can tell you, the telling gets old 
Terrible sting and terrible storm 
I can tell you the day we were born 
My friend is gone, he ran away 
I can tell you, I love him each day 
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged

Body of water
Toxic and timeless
Atlantic ocean
New York skyline
I always get lost
When I leave the village
So I couldn't come meet you 
In Brooklyn last night

But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace to the people I meet

That wipes the slate clean

So don't be fooled
No don't get lied to
Love was always cruel

And don't act strange
Don't be a stranger

Well if I could tame
All of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The winds indecision 
The sorrowful rain

Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind

And now I'm riding
All over this island
Looking for something 
To open my eyes

But I still sing glory from my high rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time, when we'll be set free

So don't stay mad
Just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new

In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Parasite,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/parasite.html,"Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two

I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you might see me on the ground

Take a look, you may see me in the dirt

The way she danced, the color of her hair

Looking for a ticket to take me away from here

Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Oh, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody love me,
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""

I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television,
I wanna see me staring right back at me

I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
Cos I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder

An anatomy of kisses

Between the sheets of union

whether machines turn anyone

So you say that I am rated X,
You suffer from the lack of sex.
Black heart and your lipstick smeared.
Your points are trite and I'm too sober
To deal with you running over
Your same pathetic cliche lines.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.

Don't try to be cute with me,

If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
It's so hard sometimes
Then I fell in love with you
Then came you
And you took that away
It's not so difficult
The world is not so difficult
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you

Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home

You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through

Didn't do the things you meant to do

Automatic guns
Death in large numbers
And no respect for women or our little ones
I tried talking to Jesus
But he just put me on hold
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And he could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
When you've given up the drink
And those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early, at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up, I watch it as it sets
Yeah, this is as good as it gets

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like sleeping with Marie
She is one sexy girl full of mystery
She says she doesn't love me
But she likes my company
For now that's good enough for me

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like swimming in the sea
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free (or a woman if you are one)
I like swimming in the sea

Perfect Situation,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/perfectsituation.html,"What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain.
There's the pitch, slow and straight.
All I have to do is swing
and I'm the hero, but I'm the zero.

Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable.
'Cause I could not have it better,
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto.
I just pass through...

Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.

Get your hands off the girl,
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company.
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander...
Can you blame her?

Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.

Tell me there's a logic out there.
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come.
Tell me there's some hope for me.
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth.

I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair),Sandi Thom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandithom/iwishiwasapunkrockerwithflowersinmyhair.html,"Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar,
Not everybody drove a car,
When music really mattered and when radio was king,
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop-stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
My mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs,
And playing games meant kick-arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care

Today the wind is blowing hard
See that bird is floating high

I spent a day all by myself
A rich man without his wealth
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm not the only one

The afternoon was very clear
The sun was beating down on me
I got thirsty for a beer
That I had to go to sea
The sea was very rough
It made me feel sick
But I like that kind of stuff
It beats arithmetic

I don't want the world to change
I like the way it is
Just give me one more wish
I can't get enough of this
When it gets to be alive
And not just still survive
To hit and not to miss
I can't get enough of this

The early evening mists
Look beautiful to me
Was sweeter than a kiss
I wish you all could see
I'm a long long way from home
But this photograph of you
Even though it's monochrome
Tells me what I should do
So I got up on my feet
I knew it would be alright
For my clothes were looking beat
In the middle of the night

I don't want the world to change
I like the way it is
Just give me one more wish

By all of the petty things that I couldn't do
All of the plastic, products, shows, and woes

I wanna get out but there's no in-between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that I've sunken so low

If I wanna be free
I gotta stop playin' round and runnin' from me

We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Back from holiday in my head
The ocean calling
Magic in the grave at the end
The old way falling

Something calling asking to create
The only other lasting love to make

The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born

There is something within, I'm awake
All my friends
There's something between
Because something within, I'm awake
You're all my friends
Alone, enough, awake [repeat]

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you? Good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand it's not my problem

You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time

To tell when he's home
In search of a story

Not wanting to be
Seen on their own

To leave from them all

Till its stalk is in the ground

Till time has flown 
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show

Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
Till you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why
Safe in a womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light

Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know 
What you are really worth

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while

From a much updated style

Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
Till time has flown far from their dying day

Some People,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/somepeople.html,"Some people kill for less
Some people find it hard to get dressed
Some people, well
Ask how old I am

Some people need more than a slice
But when it fades
When the glitter's gone

You know it
You owe it to yourself
You won't let it make you mad
It's already crazy

Old and lonely when the shade is down
The brighter lights just smells their empty heads

Some people don't get much
Some people feel they're in touch
With spirit worlds, talking to you now

Some people just gotta say
Some people just wanna play
They get a kick when it's all messed up

No one to love me
Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree.

All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago.

I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies.

I was made to love magic...

I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never.

The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

""do they collide?"" 
I ask and you smile.

When you need directions then i'll be the guide

That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.

I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me

Or goes out in the rain

In her journey to the stars.

Who can know
The reasons for her smile
What are her dreams
When they've journeyed for a mile
The way she sings
And her brightly coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky.

Who can know
What happens in her mind
Did she come from a strange world
And leave her mind behind
Her long lost sighs
And her brightly coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind.

I was left by the roadside all alone

There is no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way.

The trees on the hill had nothing to say
They would keep their dreams till another day
So they stood and thought and wondered why
For this was the time of no reply.

Time goes by from year to year
And no one asks why I am standing here
But I have my answer as I look to the sky

Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband ""Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied

Laughing at my torch

And I know that there is good

That you weren't having fun

You take the mortar, block, and glass
And you forget the speech that moved the stone
And it's really not that you can't see

And I swore I was listening

Around the part about me acting my age

I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and

Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you

Don't want you hanging out with

Drunk Girl,Something Corporate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/somethingcorporate/drunkgirl.html,"I kissed a drunk girl
I kissed a drunk girl, yes I did
Kissed a drunk girl on the lips
I let my guard down
how could I have been so dumb
Her eyes were open
I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else

I went to her house
and everybody there was gone
her little cousin just passed out on the lawn
We walked to my car 
She mouthed ""Is everything ok?"" 
We leaned in slowly 
So now I can say 

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else
anybody else

I pulled away
cuz you see I didn't think it would be
right I said let's save this
for some other night
She said ""No, no, no I know
That everything is gonna be just fine""
How could I do this when I want her to be all mine.

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else
anybody else

I know you don't care about me
I'm sure when all is said and done
and I go home feeling lonely
You will have had your fun
do you even remember?

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
and now I'm sure
and now I'm sure
I could've been anybody else
anybody else
anybody else
I could have been

Do you swear in the night
Will it mean much to you
If I treat you right.
Do you like what you're doing,
Would you do it some more
Or will you stop once and wonder
What you're doing it for.
Hey slow Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.
Hey slow Jane, live your lie
Slow, slow jane, fly on by.",1970,happy

Did You See the Words,Animal Collective,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animalcollective/didyouseethewords.html,"Have you seen them? 
The words cut open your poor intestines 
Can't deny when the inky periods drip from your mailbox and blood flies dip and glide reach down
Inside
There's something living in these lines.

And when your newest kisser is peeking 
You dress yourself up tonight get all tangled up in arms and legs it's cramped up and someone grabs a hold do you go 
Ohhhhh
Should you go home? 
There's something starting don't know why.

And in a house so cozy few words are spoken 
Let's take our shoes off and unwind when there's minuets off in the background drowning out eyes off ears off test the kiss 
Goodnight
A kiss goodnight
Don't keep my loving on my mind.

Because it's messy, yes, this mess is mine
Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine

Look we've had similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns
Do the elderly couples still kiss and hug and grab their big wrinkly skin so tough wrinkly wrink wrink wrinkly roughâ¦?

Did you see the words you know?

Violent ends with friends that go

Poor Boy,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/poorboy.html,"Never sing for my supper
I never help my neighbour
Never do what is proper
For my share of labour.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day

But I ain't going down like that
No I ain't going down like that

Because I'm better than him
And I know where I've been
And I know where I'm comin' from
A lie is a sin, but don't we all sin
That is the truth, and the truth is grim
Now he's in jail and his story is for sale
The farmer's dog wags his crippled tail
It points to the West and leaves out the rest
And invites you to be his special guest

I remember when I saw the leaves fall
I was in the woods, in a gown you wouldn't wear to the ball
Into the ditch I fly wanted dead or alive

And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need

Screaming me over and over and over

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery

Hold On,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/holdon.html,"Say you to me
You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searchin' the land
For a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

Underneath, I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearin' me apart
Right from the very start
And now I see
That it don't take a trick of the light to excite me
So strong
So long
You'll see

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Simplicity
A heart of gold, an old head, and young shoulders
Quiet and lovely
Becomin' part of me
And now I see
From a handful of names and a thousand faces
One light, burnin', furiously

I was tired of January
I was tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I was tired of January
Tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I felt a change a-comin
I felt a change a-comin
felt a change a-comin, soon

Know you got

Barrowland Ballroom,Amy Macdonald,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amymacdonald/barrowlandballroom.html,"Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone.
Oh the girls in the Queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung.

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
through the Barrowland history
and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care it's
it's only me and you.
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
it's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you.
That people they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care
tonight, it's only me and you.

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band starts to play.
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

[Chorus]

And when the night turns to day
And the lights they fade away
I wish that life and love would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear.
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age.

I Don't Wanna Grow Up,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/idontwannagrowup.html,"When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up

Seems like folks turn into things
that they'd never want
The only thing to live for
Is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up


Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up",1992,happy

Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old
Old dirt road
Rambling rose
Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold",,happy

Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man-made
Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames
Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up
In your own domain
Fire crackers ohh and aah
But they never maintain

Flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides on an alter made from the ground

Fire descends on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on to Mount Zion

One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries but the other one sings
You walk around like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got, thank God for all that life brings
The poor man has it all but not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty but he's sitting like a king

Backpack's getting heavy, moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders and lead around your waist

Think of all the fun you had.

The finest line divides a night well spent from a waste of time.

Think of all the days you spent alone with just your T.V. set and I

I can barely smile
(We won't stand for)

Monster Love,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/monsterlove.html,"I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come
The folly of a monster love like you

Grey is good
The light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town

I save the part
The sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
But I know a papermoon
The folly of a monster love like you

The pavement smell just after rain
The sun leaps out, it's clear again
I told you how I felt the earth could move
The folly of a monster love like you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start

Stop dancing to the music

Keep a mild groove on

Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail

Chemo Limo,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/chemolimo.html,"I had a dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said if you don't want to do it
then you don't have to do it
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then in my dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway
And I smiled cause I'd known it all the while.

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I ain't about to pay for this shit
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine

I ain't about to to die like this
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
And besides this shit is making me tired
it's making me tired
it's making me tired
You know I plan to retire some day,
And I'm gonna go out in style
go out in style
This shit it's making me tired
it's making me tired
it's making me tired
But mama's gonna go out in style, go out in style

When I woke up
My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company

Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in

The doctor he asked which way we were headed
I said, Sir, let's just go west and he listened obediently,
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
with her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

Plenty of Paper,Eisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eisley/plentyofpaper.html,"Something's growing under that wing
I think a face is dawning
Oh no the books are growing faces
And you're lost quite classically
With your nose in a book
And it seems so fitting
And perhaps this is the end we've sought after for so long
And perhaps now it's done

Cause we've found all the dire dreams of men and machines
And turned them all around our identical hands
Composing our commands
I cut the moon in half
And stuck a piece to my hair
It made the back of my head glow
Golden yellow and then I took
Ten stars on sticks and placed them in my small metal
Bucket and I gave the other half of the moon to you
Ooh, so you wouldn't forget me while I'm gone

Cause we found all the dire dreams of men and machines and
Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves
Our paperback books, our charming looks
Our identical hands
Composing our commands
And oh my love
We can live on the sun
And wouldn't we be attractive
Riding in our shiny motor cars
With eyeglasses full of stars
And plenty of paper for scenery paintings

'cause we found all the dire dreams of men and machines and
Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves
Our paperback books, our charming looks
Our identical hands
Composing our commands",2005,happy

Not to be yourself and faceless
In a song that has no soul

I remember all the feelings

Hates her music 
Hates all of her clothes
Thinks of surgery
And a new nose
Every calorie is a war
While she wishes she 
Was a dancer
And that she'd never 
Heard of cancer
She wishes God would give her
Some answers
And make her feel beautiful

You'll have to let it go,

You'll stand up on your own, you'll stand up on your own

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

Now, my mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a drunken man needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Lord, is when he's on the drunk

Somebody go get my baby sister
Tell her to do, not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Well, I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Yes, I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, the rising sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm one

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray",1967,happy

I hear the songs and the words don't change 
I write them out of the book right there

Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older 
We've been had I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud 

See me age 19 with some dumb haircut from 
1960 moving to New York City 
live with my friends there we're all taking the same steps

Brought it to my house, where you lay

It's not a suicide, it's a crime

There had to be someone else present
At the time of death, poisons in stomach
How could she pull it, if she's dead?

Creatures (For a While),311,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/311/creaturesforawhile.html,"My name is volatile
I've been this way a long while
I'd surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It's been a wild ride
I wouldn't change a minute
I can't slow down inside
Guess that's why I live it

The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth's hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown

I'm not used to it, you'd think I'd be by now
The ins the outs the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you we're gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You're lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display

It's something one won't understand
Unless they're in it with me hand and hand

Don't buy the fear don't buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn
Even if you're coming down

Sometimes it's wearable sometimes is bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is full

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creatures

It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you

And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town

The mean of our heights is divided by the nights
Which is times'd by the daggers and the root of all our fights,
The pass of your poem just to swathe me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I am a dash and you are a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote

I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over-analysed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am ""Needing of your love""

Soothe me with your words when I need your love

Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart

You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to howl
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to

Now there's no holding back, I'm making to attack
My blood is singing with your voice, I want to pour it out
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground

Like some child possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you tear out all your tenderness

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters, hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters, hunters

The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground

And howl, and howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters
A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

When she turned twenty four
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become T.V.
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you

My darling, believe me
(Believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
(Answer my prayer)
And I'm in love with you
(Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer now, babe
(Answer my prayer)

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you

The Car Song,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/thecarsong.html,"The weekend is the weekend
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish and chips till it gets dark
I've got a lot of homework
But homework he can wait
I never start my homework till its already too late
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
But it's hard
When there's a basketball game in the park
It's 1998 
And everybody's saying:
""Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some dayÂ""

It's Monday bloody Monday
And there's two things I forgot
I forgot to do my homework
And I've only got one sock
I'm halfway through a test
But I just can't concentrate
I'm sitting next to Fontaine
I want to ask her on a date
I really want to start a conversation
But each time she walks past
I start choking on my pencil
And fall flat on my ass
I need to concentrate
I have to get this grade
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday

[BRIDGE]
But just right now
Can' think of anything better to do
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune
And maybe later 
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax 
And think of all the things I'm going to doÂ

[CHORUS]
SomedayÂ
I'll buy an old car
SomedayÂ
I'll get that car to start
SomedayÂ
I'll learn how to drive too
And then SomedayÂ
Imagine all the things I could do.

(That was 1998 now
Bring it forward to the present day now
Cause some things have changed
but some things never change)

The weekend is the weekend 
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish 'n' chips till it gets dark
I just saw Peter Parsons
Who used to be in my class
I always gave him wedgies cause I thought he worked too hard
He said, ""Harry, life is great""
I feel so happy these days
I'm a litigation lawyer
So I got it made
I'm going out with Fontaine 
Rememer her from tenth grade?
I drive a Porsche so I can't complainÂ

[BRIDGE]
Shit! And look at me can't think of anything better to do
That just sit down at the piano and write this tune
And maybe later
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax and think of all the things I'm going to doÂ

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack.
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free.

You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no.

Turn forever hand in hand.
Take it all in on your stride.

Lining them up like ass cracks.
Lay these ponies at the track.

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kidrock/allsummerlong.html,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no Internet
But, man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Sweet Home Alabama
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

We were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Chariot,Gavin DeGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gavindegraw/chariot.html,"Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon ohhhh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me

[Chorus:]
Oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your...
Strength

Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory

[Chorus]

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a feigning to a slip
And a kickin' from the hip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie Chin and little Sammy Chong
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
We took the bow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing

Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ha
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
Make sure you have expert timing
Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...",,happy
Parentheses,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/parentheses.html,"Some philosophies fuel the belief in the self
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
Built well, you're a strong letter ""I""
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
Now and then you can bend
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
You fear that you can't do it all
And you're right
Even day takes relief every day
from its work making light from the night

And when you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms

When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase

Of course I'll put my arm around you
And I'll walk you outside
Through the sliding doors
Why would I mind?

If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Of course I'll put my arm around you

That Time,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/thattime.html,"Hey remember the time when I found a human tooth down on Delancey 
Hey remember that time we decided to kiss anywhere except the mouth

Hey remember that month when I only ate boxes of tangerines 
So cheap and juicy, tangerines 

Hey remember that time when I would only read Shakespeare 
Hey remember that other time when I would only read the backs of cereal boxes 
Hey remember that time I tried to save a pigeon with a broken wing 
A street cat got him by morning and I had to bury pieces of his body in my building's playground

Hey remember that time when I would only smoke Marlboros 
Hey remember that time when I would only smoke Camels 
Hey remember that time when I was broke

Get it off with no propeller
Do it up itâs on with Stella

Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her

Scar,Missy Higgins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/missyhiggins/scar.html,"He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said ""use these down to your bones""
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought ""this one knows better than I do""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, she smelled like sugar and
Spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one, looked at my insides clicking
Her tongue and said
""This will all have to come undone""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?

Just a boy

I started to realize
That everyday he finds
Just what he's looking for
Like a shooting star he shines

He said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Did he ask if I would come along
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Set Yourself on Fire,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/setyourselfonfire.html,"In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing [x6]

Make it look whiter than it seems 
Paint me over with your dreams 
Shove away my ethnicity 
Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
And say just what is on my mind

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today 
Weatherworn, looking all the rage 
They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster 
Now itâs moccasins we sport 
We take the culture and contort 
Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you

Hey you, the one that donât fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in 
Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your

Fearless,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/fearless.html,"There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress

I danced to all your fucking soul

And your toes creepin' around
Ahhh so mindane and incomplete
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street

I'm passed out in your garden,
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body,
I'd come into your party but I'm soft

Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes,
And in your nose blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes,
You let you perfect nipple show",2005,happy

To do more things like that...

Won't you take me to your home,
Won't you be for me forever
So I'll never be alone
And just one thing...
If you're my queen...
Then it's a beautiful thing... 

Well I'm buried in my bedroom
Under fourteen feet of clothes
I could drown in all this clutter I suppose 

But then you're standing in my doorway 
With a suitcase on your back
And it blows my mind
When you do things like that

Do You Believe In Magic?,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway

I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along lil mama

I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat
The key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucka break me, dawg

Tell 'em to buzz off your n-u-t's

She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College,

Caught her eye. 

She told me that her dad was loaded

She said, ""Fine,""
And in thirty seconds time
She said,

""I want to live like common people.
I want to do whatever common people do,
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you.""

Well, what else could I do? 
I said, ""I'll see what I can do.""

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it
Somewhere,
So it started there. 

I said, ""Pretend you've got no money,""
She just laughed and said, ""Oh, you're so funny.""
I said, ""Yeah?
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here.""

You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people,

She just smiled and held my hand.

Cut your hair and get a job. 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school. 

But still you'll never get it right 
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching 'roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all.

You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
And dance and drink and screw 
Because there's nothing else to do. 

Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do. 
Because you think that poor is cool.

Requiem for O.M.M.2,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/requiemforomm2.html,"When I met you, I was just a kid -- hadn't built up my defenses.
So I gave my heart completely -- Vaseline all over the lenses.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer.
And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life.
I just had to let you go...",2005,happy

Here Comes My Baby,Cat Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catstevens/herecomesmybaby.html,"In the midnight moonlight I'll be walking a long and lonely mile.
And every time I do, I keep seeing this picture of you.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

You never walk alone, and you're forever talking on the phone.
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

I'm still waiting for your heart, cuz I'm sure that some day it's gonna start.
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'til then this is all that I can say.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.

To realise it's right before my eyes

To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?

I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you could have attained
Why try anything?
I will get there, just remember I know

You didnt even know my name 
So I walked on pretending that you still belong 
But it will never be the same no more

Its getting darker and I know time wasnt meant for us

Its like finding something pretty energized and 
If you want just hide your eyes behind your head 
But you cant see me then you cant find me anywhere

Caring Is Creepy,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/caringiscreepy.html,"I think I'll go home and mull this over
Before I cram it down my throat
At long last it's crashed, it's colossal mass
Has broken up into bits in my moat

Lift the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off
Go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin
Hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade
Far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And the whole mess of roads we're now on

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond my remote concern
Of being condescending

All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

Exoneration lost his eraser 
But my forgiver found the sun 
And there are twisted days that I take comfort 
Cause I'm not the only one 
No, I'm not the only one 

In the dark, for a while now 
I can't stay very far 
I can't stay much longer 
Riding my decision home 

There is a majesty at my doorstep 
There is a little boy in her arms 
Now we'll parade around without game plans 
Obligation or alarm 

In the dark, for a while now 
I can't stay very far

What it was all about

Moved to the west coast away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still, I was still in love

Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up...I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
Until I believed I was the crazy one, 
and in a way
I guess I was...

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading a sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

If you wrote me off I'd understand it
Because I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up...
I've landed

And you will be so
happy to know
I've come alone,
it's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's by my goodbye I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's OK to call
Now I'll answer for myself

It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic

And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault it's how I'm programmed to function

Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brunomars/justthewayyouare.html,"Ohhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhhh

Falls perfectly without her trying

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me

Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The whole world stops and stares for a while

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,

Grab your coat and hat

Sends you flyin', cryin'

Dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie
On the corner of the street

And the people, passin' by
Stare in wild wonder
And the inside juke-box
Roars out just like thunder

And ev'rything looks so complete
When you walk out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79

Wasted days you've come to pass

So go I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor

Coronation rickshaw grab

So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass

Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass",2008,happy
This Love,Maroon 5,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maroon5/thislove.html,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered ""Goodbye"", she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before

Had a band and we tried real hard.
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

That summer seemed to last forever

Yeah, I'd always wanna be there

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you've got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch

I knew that it was now or never

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no! yeah!

Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Fluorescent Adolescent,Arctic Monkeys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcticmonkeys/fluorescentadolescent.html,"You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory

Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole

Everything was pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco

Remember when you used to be a rascal?",2007,happy

The trophy wives of the astronauts

Well, i like

Spitting Games,Snow Patrol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/spittinggames.html,"I broke into your house last night
And left a note at your bedside
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
You leave me numb and I'm not sure why

I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me",2003,happy

Said you'd never come back

Forever united here somehow, yeah

My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight

We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs

I let him take it

In a million different ways which
Were all not quite right
The rain is loud on the ground

But I don't even make a sound when
I come around oh
And you say I'd be better off dead
This I know
But it's no use hiding this pretty
Head in the ground
And it's love, etc.

We can do the broken fist
We can tear down all the borders

Emerges from the mist we'll sound

Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw

Why can't I sleep at night,
Don't say it's gonna be alright,
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognaise,
and not feel bad about it for days and days and days.
In the magazines they talk about weight loss,
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss,
Oh no it's not the life I chose,
But I guess that's the way that things go,

[Chorus x2]

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [etc.]

Oh Jesus Christ almighty,
Do I feel alright? No not slightly,
I wanna get a flat I know I can't afford it,
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage,
Well it's very funny cos I got your fucking money,
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble,
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

As licky as trips

That swims in a world of magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through

And when I see you
Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say I'll keep on holding you in
My arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah as smitten as that
I can't get that small
The way you fur
The how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all

That lives in a world of make-believe
It makes me pull my hair all out

Fell Down The Stairs,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/felldownthestairs.html,"You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
For two drunk kids trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
But eventually the sky did return and I was there outside in green
I watched the world being reborn until one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know it was beautiful slow dancing
To tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love just like blood will always stain
And if I could reverse it I don't think it would be worth it
I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
No, I'll never let you go
I will never let you tumble to the ground
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go",2004,happy

Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned

Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears

And we'll get chased by the moon

Hope the passion don't fade since you decided he's your spouse

Everytime We Touch,Cascada,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cascada/everytimewetouch.html,"I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch in my dream.
(in my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why,
Without you, it's hard to survive.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
(that I cry)
The good and the bad times: we've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.

The Saltwater Room,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/thesaltwaterroom.html,"I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?

June Afternoon,Roxette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/juneafternoon.html,"Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this deja vu? 
Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, Bar-B-Q. 
Look at all the people, happy faces all around. 
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds 

It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun. 
Get your green, green tambourine, let's play in the park. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun 

Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming 
and reaching for their food. 
Let's go buy an ice-cream and a magazine with an attitude 
and put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star 
cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la 

It's a bright June afternoon... 

There's a painter painting his masterpiece. 
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees, 
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon. 
All my life I've longed for this afternoon.",,happy

You're savin' time but you're miles away
Your fly was drownin' in some bitter tea

Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide
Don't go kid yourself well not today
The satisfaction's not too far away

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but you're here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
And never miss opportunity

Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long

I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your soul?'

Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along:

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
'why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'

And she'll show you some rhythm

And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place
And continue to:
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and
Continue to -

Spanish moss on a welcome sign

Kettle corn and 4H fairs
Pink slips and white wall tires
Bet you twenty I'll beat you there

A French kiss and battle cries
Further then I've been before

Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

All the widows and teenage brides

We're all looking for a sign

It's everything that's home to me

Greetings, girl, and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul

Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

(Eye know I love you better)

It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee,
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two,
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

My name is Wepeel
I got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still makin' noise (makin' noise)

Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else?

Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah!

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

If I Ever Feel Better,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/ifieverfeelbetter.html,"They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life I can't control

They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away

Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive

I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number

Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree
And I'd 'a danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.

New slang when you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries.
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony.
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall,
Never should have called
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely.

And if you'd 'a took to me like a gull takes to the wind.
Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree
And I'd 'a danced like the king of the eyesores

God speed all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs,
And bleed into their buns 'til they melt away.

I'm looking in on the good life I might be doomed never to find.
Without a trust or flaming fields am I too dumb to refine?

Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right they will land upon their knees

Where they open all their wallets
And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And as we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And back to the kitchen sink

Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'til we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gonna worry about locking the door

For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please

In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say ""I do"" at least

Too much love drives a man insane

Kiss me baby, woo, it feels good
Hold me baby, ooh, yeah, you gonna love me like a lover should
You're fine, so kind, I'm gonna tell this world that you're mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

On which you find you love it when you twitch

You didn't understand that there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played

As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down

And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete

At the cracks

The echoes belong to someone
Someone I used to know

And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...

I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet,
But all the news reports recommended that
I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make our cells
Divide at an alarming rate until our shells
Simply cannot hold all our insides in,
And that's when we'll explode

It just has to come out

Just 'cause they tickle me

Sometimes I wish I was like Mariella

And she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak
Never had to speak
Never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse
She just doesn't make a peep

She marched to her wardrobe
And threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious
But it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby
In patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms
And so she cried for hours

Mariella, Mariella
My pretty baby girl
Unglue your lips from being together and
And wear some pink and pearls
You can have your friends 'round
And they can stay for tea
Won't you just try to fit in please
Do this for me

But Mariella just crossed her arms
As she walked up the stairs
And she went into her bedroom
And she sat on her bed
And she looked in the mirror
And she thought to herself
""If I wanna play, I can play with me
If I wanna think, I'll think in my head""

At school, Mariella didn't have many friends
Yeah the girls they all looked at her
And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase.

Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yes, she always got the crossword puzzle right everyday
And she could do the alphabet backwards
Without making any mistakes

Love Love Love,Tristan Prettyman,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tristanprettyman/lovelovelove.html,"Well, it's 4 AM,
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?

And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.

'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.

And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.

And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
Cause when I'm here I'm always something.

This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.",2005,happy

I get my back into my living

To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye

Sally, take my hand
Travel south cross land
Put out the fire
Don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older

Ever since you have been gone it's all caffeine-free

Get no harm done no 
None of them want to fight me

Combat baby come back baby 
Fight off the lethargy
Don't go quietly
Combat baby
Said you would never give up easy
Combat baby come back

Get back in town I wanna paint it black
Wanna get around 
Easy living crowd so flat
Said it all before
They try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
I want to be wrong but
No one here wants to fight me like you do

Combat baby come back baby 
Fight off the lethargy
Don't go quietly

Said you would never give up easy

Compromise
Who gets it good?
Every mighty mild seventies child

Beats me

Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye baby

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless

Possess you with one go

Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
(Say what)
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun

For the call of thunder threatens everyone

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw, final straw in the
Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time

You're the only thing that I love
It scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth I'm lost for words

What have I done it's too late for that
What have I become truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask...this time",2003,happy

Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.

The dying embers of the night A FIRE THAT SLOWLY FADES TILL DAWN
still glow upon the wall so bright BURNING BURNING BURNING
The tired streets that hide away FROM HERE TO EVERYWHERE THEY GO
roll past my door into the day IN MY BLUE WORLD

Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.
Turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.

Why you ain't comin' home if I'm turnin' to stone?
You've been gone for so long and I can't carry on,

The dancing shadows on the wall THE TWO-STEP IN THE HALL
are all I see since you've been gone TURNING TURNING TURNING
Through all I sit here and I wait I TURN TO STONE I TURN TO STONE
You will return again some day TO MY BLUE WORLD

If You Got the Money,Jamie T,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiet/ifyougotthemoney.html,"If you got the money,
I think it would be funny
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

An' all the boys they go:
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...

I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gum
While a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.

'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody the sound of spit
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
So toot what took man choke on it

We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?

Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap

If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me

And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free

With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead

Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter

With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

Move outta' the way man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

King Of The Rodeo,Kings of Leon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kingsofleon/kingoftherodeo.html,"He's so the purity, a shaven and a mourning,
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray

Straight in the picture pose
He's coming round to meet you

And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll let the good times roll,
Cowgirl king of the rodeo let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor,
Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start

Take off your overcoat you're staying for the weekend,
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

Good time to roll on",2005,happy

Is always Mister Right, 'cause we are

Have to let them be

I don't let them play
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day, 'cause they are

Cut the cord

My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Hear my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could

And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've gotta let me go

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

When you dream of home tonight
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could

With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)

And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Is gonna rule the population

Drops of Jupiter,Train,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/train/dropsofjupiter.html,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey

Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting starâ
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey (mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey (yeah)

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation?
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?

Know Your Onion!,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/knowyouronion.html,"Shut out, pimpled and angry.
I quietly tied all my guts into knots.
Gave up on trying to make them,
I figured it'd take them too long to look up and besides...

It was undeniably clear to me i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew what worthless dregs we've always been.

Lucked out and found my favorite records
Lying in wait at the birmingham mall.
The songs that i heard,
The occasional book
Were the only fun i ever took.
And i got on with making myself.
The trick is just making yourself.

But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight...

Three thousand miles north east
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads.
""what kind of life you dream of? you're allergic to love.""
Yes i know but i must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me, i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters

The selfless, loving saints we are,
The melting, sliding dice we've always been.",2001,happy

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;
and Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.
World serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs.
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no strength.
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down height.
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site.
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck.

Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
Look at that low plane! Fine, then.
Uh oh, overflow, population, Common Food,
But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.

Feeling pretty psyched.

Slash and burn, return,
Listen to yourself churn.
Lock him in uniform and book burning, bloodletting.
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.
Light a candle, light a votive.
Step down, step down.
Watch a heel crush, crush.
Uh oh, this means no fear; cavalier.
Renegade and steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament,
A tournament of lies.
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives

And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

Your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
But left to my own devices,
I'm addicted â it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My sleaze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a love sick crack head

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind!

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
(I said)
Your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug?
Your drug?
Huh, your drug?
Huh, your drug?
Is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

A Little Respect,Wheatus,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wheatus/alittlerespect.html,"I tried to discover a little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart

That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
That you give me no . . . Soul
I hear you calling
Oh baby please give a little respect to me.

And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me? 
We can make love not war, and live in peace with our hearts
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover? 
Don't you tell me no. . . Soul. 
I hear you calling
Oh baby please, give a little respect to me.

I'm so in love with you

Gets the same train every time.

It never fails.

And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And his mother goes to meetings,
While his father pulls the maid,
And she stirs the tea with councilors,
While discussing foreign trade,
And she passes looks, as well as bills
At every suave young man

And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And he likes his own backyard,
And he likes his fags the best,
'Cause he's better than the rest,
And his own sweat smells the best,
And he hopes to grab his father's loot,
When Pater passes on.

'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And he plays at stocks and shares,
And he goes to the Regatta,
And he adores the girl next door,
'Cause he's dying to get at her,
But his mother knows the best about
The matrimonial stakes.

'Cause he's oh, so good,

Hiding out between the lines

Not up a hill â¦ but down to an old wharf shack

Inside I heard the trumpets call
I salute to the champions on the wall
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced

And the night she looked so fine to me
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
And so tie me to the mast I must believe!

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite
Still I kept the sight of my desire

And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
Lights dimmed but she shone like mythology
And I must admit she felt so alive

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

She waves for everybody down on the floor
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
And there we were in the depths of the wild below

Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
She whispered 'wait for the trumpets call'
It's not exactly love it's to adore

Everyday Is a Winding Road,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/everydayisawindingroad.html,"I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He says he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there but the brochure looks nice
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low,
These are the days when anything goes

[Chorus]
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

[Chorus]

I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on coffee and nicotine
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen
Were ever real, were ever really happening

And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo

Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime

Put my glasses on

Heaven for the Weather,The Streets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/streets/heavenfortheweather.html,"I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

There's something in the sun this day, I feel it 
Or maybe it's just my hay fever 
The weeds are green, the sky is shining 
But it'll soon be night which is nicer 
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room 
And the devil gestures to you 
You've never seen such a Beelzebee 
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening 
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out 
What do you make of this doubt? 
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up 
Easy - I know what my speech should be 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

The devil beams a big beaming grin 
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin 
He holds up paperwork - sign the line 
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine 
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet 
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreat 
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin 
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin 
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars 
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating - 
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

You tell the devil in no uncertain terms 
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned 
What is this evil? And who decides this? 
When left to devices some humans try shit 
This is the reason we should all be tied up? 
We're just normal people exploring our minds 
We don't go around here putting poison in wine 
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right 
People are intricate, people aren't swines 
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds 
Sign on the line 
You sign on the line 
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide

I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare

Save us all, tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh, crystal ball, hear my song
I'm fading out, everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong",2006,happy
Life,Des'ree,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/desree/life.html,"Mmm, yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Oh life, oh life

I'm afraid of the dark
Especially when I'm in a park
And there's no one else around
Ooh, I get the shivers

I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo doo

I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbit's tail

I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there
Bungee jumping, I don't care

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo
Life, doo, doo doo
Doo, doo doo

So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Life indeed can be fun
If you really want to

Sometimes living out your dreams
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world
In a beautiful balloon

Happiness Runs,Donovan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donovan/happinessruns.html,"Little pebble upon the sand
Now you're lying here in my hand,
How many years have you been here?

Depending in which land
You may find yourself.

Everybody is a part of everything anyway,
You can have everything if you let yourself be.

Rainbows in the Dark,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/rainbowsinthedark.html,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naÃ¯ve son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
We finally had front-page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the colour's so vibrant , the colour's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river",2006,happy
Hold Music,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/holdmusic.html,"Hey you know my friend lisa
she's down from LA
we've been places like this
there always the same
we'll loosen the rope just enough to make you pay
when my memory is hazy
we're moving away
to rent a display home
avoid all the grey
2 bees in a storm
the honey's stuck us by the hair

hold music
give it to me baby don't you dare lose it

when we're sleeping in daily
there's ice on the road
I bought us a dragon
to lighten the load
he's keeping us warm
the blood keep flowing to your head
Say I've never been stately
I'm legless at sea
my spirit has felt you since 1903
I'm trying to be normal
but there's evil in my head

hold music
give it to me bay don't you dare lose it

You're so dangerous
everybody's gonna hide out back
it doesn't matter that you're serious
move along sad face your cover's blown
cmon there you are
and we're outta space and you're out of space
change the beat fast
or your enemies will see you naked

hold music hold music hold

When we were out drinking
I found you a home
4 million in prizes
you left me alone
when we were forlorn
I found some poison in your bed
Though you may mistake me
I'll never be free
I'm stuck in the crossfire
between you and he
tattoos on his arms
he got a needle for a head

Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens

With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember
She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air

So lovely...
She was everything to me

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault...
She was a gymnast, happily swinging
On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon",2008,happy
Gypsy,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/gypsy.html,"Broke my heart on the road
Spent the weekend sewing the pieces back on
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly

Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying but you can't always win

'Cause I'm a gypsy
Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements
Just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy

('Cause I'm a gypsy)

I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

'Cause I'm a gypsy
Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
I don't make agreements
Just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy

And I say
""Hey, you! You're no fool if you say 'No'""
Ain't it just the way life goes?
People fear what they don't know

Come along for the ride (oh, yeah)
Come along for the ride (ooh)

Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.

But, oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
It sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine

Why can't we be making love nice and easy,

Take a trip somewhere far, far away,

Song Against Sex,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neutralmilkhotel/songagainstsex.html,"And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, ""Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string""
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream - 
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind 
So I'm always sober
Always aching 
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you...
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving - 
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.",1996,happy

And i'm high enough from all the waiting

Can't help but love, you know...

What - part of no - don't you understand - i've told you before
To just get - off my case - this isn't happening - stop this now
And i - where was i? - i have to be somewhere
Now where did i put it?

And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling

To ride a wave on your inhaling

Yes - hello we're back - and we're taking calls

Come Fly With Me,Frank Sinatra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/comeflywithme.html,"Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along

If It Makes You Happy,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/ifitmakesyouhappy.html,"I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos,
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, o.k. I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

[Chorus]
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, o.k. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

[Chorus]

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between
Well, o.k. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

Ugly,Sugababes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugababes/ugly.html,"When I was 7
They said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was OK
They said you're more beautiful
And that's the way they show that they wish
That they had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous cos

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
Cos I didn't know my body would change
I grew taller than them in more ways
But there will always be the one who will say
Something bad to make them feel great

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do

And never realises how it affects somebody

Envy is the only thing it could be

First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/firstdayofmylife.html,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005,happy
Saint Simon,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/saintsimon.html,"After all these implements and text designed by intellects
So vexed to find evidently there's just so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night

Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside

There's no measuring of it
As nothing else is love

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

And feel, feel what its like to be new

Cause in my head thereâs a greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
where theyâre far more suited than here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one anotherâs
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe itâs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause youâre the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body

Anyone Else But You,The Moldy Peaches,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moldypeaches/anyoneelsebutyou.html,"You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
Kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swingin' from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So, why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3, DVD, rumble-pack guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, ""b"", ""a"", start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

You are always tryin' to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

We both have shiny, happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan!
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Squinched up your face and did a dance
Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Your folks told me you should be left alone, 
on a mountain top 
knocking the aeroplanes down with stones. 

Do the whirlwind 
and carry the hope that stings all night long, 
Don't abandon him 
'cause he quivers when he hears your song.

Believe me, it's safe to see,
At least be confused about right and wrong, 
Plan to settle down, 
Over the moon under the sun. 

Do the whirlwind, 
and shotgun the seat that beats (beats) 
Hanging on to the one you love 
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on. 

Folks given up under the quivers and lines, 
You do the whirlwind, 
Don't abandon, 
Get a handle of yourself, son

Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation
And I'll say FUCK BUSH AND FUCK THIS WAR
My war paint is sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful

Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true

Would it make it better?

Would we have somewhere to go?

We could go to the cinema 
Big effects and big named stars 
And we can go to that private view 
But darling these days my favorite view is you 
Lets just bend the invitation 
And leave our bikes down at the station 
Lose our sense of direction 
There's nothing here to lose 

Oh you will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly 
You're my love 
So come away with me 
Lets get lost till empty 

We could stay here till closing time 
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime 
We could dance till our feet turn red 

But the beats so boring 
And I'd rather be home in our bed 

This towns skipping like a record 
Reruns get me so bored 
So with enough that I can afford 
Lets get lost 
Again 

Yeah we will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly 
You're my love 
Come get lost with me 
Till we run on empty 

Lets go 
Lets go 
You're my love come get lost with me 
You're my love come till empty 
Lets go",2007,happy
Wonderwall,Oasis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/wonderwall.html,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)

Where it goes, you'll know
Where it leads
Follow your instinct

Find the one missing link

What you never believe
Could be your scene

It's your call
Iron out the creases
Pick up the pieces
Wherever they may fall

What you never believe
Could be your scene

After all, the world is yours
If you take it for its flaw
Don't expect too much for what you want
Diamonds in the rough, I'll keep
The devil wants to make a deal
But you should take to heart
The sound of life

Love Song,Sara Bareilles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarabareilles/lovesong.html,"Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today, today

I learned the hard way
That they all say things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me, you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight my guide gone
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this

Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush.
Start to rush by.
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone.

What's going on, on the floor?

In the mean time stay, let me watch you break it down.

Out by the fire breathing

Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

You'll never wait so long

Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

Woah woah. Woah woah

Skipping beats, blushing cheeks I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner cafÃ©
And then i'm left in bits recovering tectonic tremblings
You get me every time

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing
Got lucky, beautiful shot you taking everything off watch the curtains wide open
Then you fall in the same routine flicking through the TV relaxed and reclining
And you think you're alone...

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

One of these days, you'll miss your train and come stay with me
We'll have drinks and talk about things, any excuse to stay awake with you
You'll sleep here, i'll sleep there, but then the heating may be down again
at my convenience
we'd be good, we'd be great together.

Wonderful World,James Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmorrison/wonderfulworld.html,"I've been down so low
People look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong

Staring through a window
Standing outside, they're just too happy to care tonight
I want to be like them
But I'll mess it up again

I tripped on my way in
And got kicked outside, everybody saw...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love
It just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything
I'd never, never, ever let you feel alone
I won't I won't leave you, on your own

But who am I to dream?
Dreams are for fools, they let you down...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me, or maybe just a little letter
Oh, we could start again

But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well

What did you do? What did you say?
Did you walk - or did you run away?
Where are you now? Where have you been?
Did you go alone - or did you bring a friend?

[Hook #1]
I need to know this - cause I notice when you're smilin'
Out in the sun havin' fun and you're feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me

What went right? What went wrong?
Was it the story - or was it the song?
Was it overnight - or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

[Hook #2]
Or all the above - oh how I love to see you smilin'
And oh yeah - take a little pain just in case
You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smilin' face
Hey, put on a smilin' face

[Bridge]
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

[Hook #3]
I want to be you - whenever I see you smilin'
Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face",2006,happy

Past pier thirty nine
Early p.m.
Can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab
Stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of
But it turned out just right

It started straight off
""Coming here is hell""
That's his first words
We asked what he meant
He said "" where ya' from?""
We told him our lot
""When ya' take a holiday
Is this what you want?""

Lie around all day
Have a drink to chase
""Yourself and tourists, yeah

If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you

I want to get along with you

Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),Garbage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garbage/cherrylipsgobabygo.html,"She gave you everything she had 
But she was young and dumb 
She'd just turned 21 
She didn't care to hang around 
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found 
This life can turn a good girl bad 
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

With your cherry lips and golden curls 
You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past 
And in your hot pants and high heels 
They could not believe that such a body was for real 
It seemed like rainbows would appear 
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear 
Because you looked just like a girl 
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts 
You make the whole world wanna dance 
You bought yourself a second chance 

Go baby go go 
We're right behind you 
Go baby go go

Maxwell's Silver Hammer,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/maxwellssilverhammer.html,"Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so"" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

On a Peavea amp in 1984

Playing Sara-with-no-h's favourite song

(La da da da, la da da, la da da)

Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Because at home they got her smacked

Zak called his dad about layaway plans
And Sara told the friendly salesman that:
""You'll all die in your cars,
And why's it gotta be dark?
And you're all working in a submarine""

(Asshole) 

She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped

Foundations,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/foundations.html,"Thursday night,
Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eye,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say.
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends.

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoyin'
And say something like
""Yeah, intelligent input darlin'. Why don't you just have another beer then?""

Then you'll call me a ""bitch"" and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

You said I must eat so many lemons,
'Cause I am so bitter.
I said, ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate,
'Cause they are much fitter.""

Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget,
But I can't.

Your face is pasty,
'Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
'Cause it's making me sick.

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these yesterday.
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this.

Well I'll leave you there 'til the mornin',
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile.

So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find â you painted flowers on it
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon.

Well, I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all,
Over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine,
We're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You'd play me boogie woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are.

We built our get away up in a tree we found.
We felt so far away, but we were still in town.
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at.

Well, all these times they come and go

I have found in this place

And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Oh how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all",1998,happy

Amber,311,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/311/amber.html,"Brainstorm
take me away from the norm
I got to tell you something
this phenomenon
I had to put it in a song

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
you ought to know what brings me here
you glide through my head blind to fear
and I know why
whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

You live too far away
your voice rings like a bell anyway
don't give up your independence
unless it feels so right
nothing good comes easily
sometimes you gotta fight

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy

Well, I heard ole Neil put her down

A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Where the skies are so blue

Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two

They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

Solsbury Hill,Peter Gabriel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petergabriel/solsburyhill.html,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
(I) just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said ""Grab your things,
I've come to take you home.""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
""Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" he said ""Grab your things
I've come to take you home.""
(Back home.)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said ""You can keep my things,
they've come to take me home.""",1977,happy
Your Song,Elton John,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/yoursong.html,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

It's been a perfect day
We're all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California

We watched the sunset from my car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah

And if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you

We've been singing Billie Jean
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
We've got strangers stopping by
And though you're out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And all I'll say is I don't wanna say good night

There's no quiet corner
To get to know each other
And there's no hurry

One Week,Barenaked Ladies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barenakedladies/oneweek.html,"It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me saying
""Get back together come back and save me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
'Cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
That vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air
And said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault
Not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set a' better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides
And said, ""I'm sorry.""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me
Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground

Somewhere it's not dark, dark, dark, dark

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
And don't go finding a replacement,
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart

Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that that it feels like it is ending

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you

And you shout out loud
And you're bursting with pride
'Cause they don't let you talk
And your heart is finally mending

It's not too late now to change your mind
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line

Tire Swing,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/tireswing.html,"I took the Polaroid down in my room.
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend.
It's not as if I don't like you.
It just makes me sad whenever I see it.

'Cause I like to be gone most of the time,
And you like to be home most of the time.
If I stay in one place I lose my mind.
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride,
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason.
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan.
Paul Baribeau took me to the giant tire swing,
Gave me a push and he started singing.
I sang along while I was swinging.
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

Now I'm home for less than 24 hours.
That's hardly time to take a shower.
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall.
Check my e-mail, write a song and make a few phone calls.

Before it's time to leave again
I got one hand on the steering wheel, one waving out the window.
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My yarns will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.

And had it nailed to my forehead again 
To keep this boat afloat 
There are things you can't afford to know 
So I save all my breath for the sails. 

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Walking a bridge with weakening cables 
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through. 

Most ideas turn to dust 
As there are few in which we all can trust 
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mind? 
So let's abandon that track 
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack 
Cause we are way too wise-assed for that. 

You might find some fools at your doorstep 
Hustling the latest changes to the book 
That's the strangest in an attempt to multiply 
Marionettes on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate 
Because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through. 

We've taken on a climb 
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs 
Walking up a slide 
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track.

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice

Wishbone,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/wishbone.html,"Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away (Romantic)

Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?

Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cuz I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)

Tambourine style, walking in a single file
You whisper half thoughts to me

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?",2005,happy

Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive

Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive

I dwell in the darkness
I let in the light
I sleep in the afternoon and become the noise in the night
I trespass in temptation suffer in sacrifice
But I awake each day with the new sunrise

On the Wing,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/onthewing.html,"Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone? 

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades

That you have to choose
What you win or lose

Don't you love in vain

And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me

Just wanna be happy, yeah

Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just tryna play my role
Slowly disappear, oh

But all these days,
They feel like they're the same
Just different faces, different names
Get me out of here

Well, I can't stand by the side, oh, no,
And watch this life pass me by, pass me by

No better than fine, perfect in my mind
In fact, I wish your heart was mine
And I can hear the memory in my ears
Back to the years and all those tears
But hear me when I say I'm glad we steered that way
Because now we're here

Do you want to get away? get in the car we can leave today
Do you want to celebrate our just made little holiday?
Cause now today is your day
All that stuff you used to take 
I'm glad you threw all that away cause now you look so great
You never need to be afraid just know you went the right way

Because even though we never get things right
And it gets so old just saying we'll keep trying
It's mine to decide when I'll be alright

I know you're going crazy (crazy)
But happy is all that you make me (all you make me)
And now things are gonna get better baby
I know everything went wrong OK (OK)
But now it's time to get some better days (some better days)

Walking like strangers among these states
Only time will tell how long I can wait

Sultans of Swing,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/sultansofswing.html,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south London town

You check out guitar, George
He knows all the chords
Mind it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band
It ain't what they call ""Rock 'n' Roll""
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole, Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home.""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing,
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing.""",1978,happy

He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover."" (yeah)

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty.""
And he said:

""Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover.""",1981,happy
I Can See Clearly Now,Johnny Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnynash/icanseeclearlynow.html,"I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky

I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind

The Underdog,Spoon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/spoon/theunderdog.html,"Picture yourself in the living room
Your pipe and slippers set out for you
I know you think that it ain't too far

But I hear the call of a lifetime ring
Felt the need to get up for it
Oh you cut out the middleman
Get free from the middleman

You got no time for the messenger,
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive!

I want to forget how conviction fits
But can I get out from under it?
Can I gut it out of me?
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
Can't let go of it,

Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,
You will not back up an inch ever,
That's why you will not survive,

The thing that I tell you now
It may not go over well
And it may not be photo-op
In the way that I spell it out

But you won't hear from the messenger,
Don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive! (Hey!)",2007,happy

Has got a body like you

Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

Say please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me

For Khrushchev and Kennedy

You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

Dynamite with a laser beam

Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

Was doing a thing called ""The Crocodile Rock""
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace

It's no way to be

The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen

The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

My life overturned
Unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself

What's my release??
What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Are you fucking happy?

She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And god only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need moreâ

There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
Got my mind made up now

How you behave
Not much like a lover
More like a slave

She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit fooling around""

Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Making one as lovely as she

Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

In a green field somewhere near a freeway
I'm all tan and smiling and running from third base
It's hot and the kids keep on playing the driving game
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
And the sky is a bluish gray

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone

In my dreams, i see you at the foot of some mountains
And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
It's late and the sun keeps shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up

I've become just like a terrible mess
Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
But the crowds keep me coming back
Cheering

In my dreams, i see you asleep in a twin bed
The covers pulled up over your head
Am i asleep or awake?
It's morning and the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am i asleep or awake?

It just feels good when we're waking up
It just feels good when you're next to me
It just feels good when you're coming home
It just feels good when it's waking up
My slumbering heart

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there

I'm not a failure i swear
I wish you could see it from over there
I've got a lot over here without you

Girl,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/girl.html,"I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye

Life Is a Flower,Ace of Base,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aceofbase/lifeisaflower.html,"We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today, ah-ah ah...

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind...

I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye
Can help you from yourself

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind...

Please Mr. Agony
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life

We live in a free world...

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either

Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos 
Of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure,
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole
life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on
the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

Otherwise the bar is ours,
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
cars
The sun and the moon but

A willow tree,
Whose tears didn't care,
They just hung in the air,
And refused to fall, to fall.

And I knew I'd made a horrible call,
And now the state line felt like the Berlin Wall,
And there was no doubt about which side I was on.

'Cause I built you a home in my heart,
With rotten wood meant to cave from the start.

'Cause you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I braved treacherous streets,
And kids strung out on homemade speed.
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep,
At all

'Cause at night the sun in retreat,
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth,
In the mouth of a man who was devouring
Us both.

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech,
But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I'm a war of head versus heart,
And it's always this way.
My head is weak, my heart always speaks,
Before I know what it will say.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No, you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

No, you can't find nothing at all,

Billy Liar,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/billyliar.html,"Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
Staring over at the neighbor's, knickers down.
He's got his knickers down.

So the summer is eternity for you?
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
He's shaking you down.

And the mailroom shift gets a real short shrift
As you dole out the packages, no-one seems to want you around
All skulking around.

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.

All a-drifting, he's a no-good boyo
Sent a-fishing for a whalebone corset frame
(His only catch all day)

So he sits and lets the current take him
A gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray
And at his ankles laid.

As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.",2003,happy

Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

Câmon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, at least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, itâs been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You shouldâve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

Câmon can you count all the loves that didnât last?
Itâs such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said we wouldâve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youthâs taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing....

So I left, that is it. Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât keep friends, I keep acquainted,
Iâm not a prophet, but Iâm here to profit.

Thatâs all, Iâm gone! Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.

Ain't as bright as the star I've found
Every drawing that I drew
Was never ever as cute as you

Serious as a heart attack
I'm looking in my almanac
I gotta find out all the things
And find out where she got her wings

How can I check lost and found
When I'm too busy getting down

Gotta get it back to
A backup plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one

I swear that I'm not kidding
We're just looking to fit in
With all the other answers
Questions never confirmed
States that keep us far apart
Track the beating of my heart
Mark the places in my book
With photographs we never took
I swear that I'm not kidding
The night time is so pretty
With all the stars above your eyes
I'm sneaking out and making ties
States that keep us far apart
Track the beating with a chart
Mark the rhythms that I shook
Everytime I caught you look

It got blurry cause I'd had enough
And he tried to take your soul
But didn't realise you keep it in a different hole

Won't you come on over

A loaded gun, I don't know if he

Maybe I'll go traveling for a year
Finding myself, or start a career
Could work the poor, though I'm hungry for fame
We all seem so different but we're just the same
Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat
Aren't things more easy, with a tight six pack
Who knows the answers, who do you trust
I can't even separate love from lust
Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans
Working nine to five, answering phones
But don't make me live for Friday nights
Drinking eight pints and getting in fights
Maybe I'll just fall in love
That could solve it all
Philosophers say that that's enough
There surely must be more
Love ain't the answer, nor is work
The truth eludes me so much it hurts
But I'm still having fun and I guess that's the key

Carried Away,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/carriedaway.html,"Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold in
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper, my money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend

Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

All your appeal
Once again we'd feel it
Higher education making sense

Justify your thesis
Certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defence

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can

Let's agree there's no need
No more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Won't you have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

Carried away from you

Captains and Cruise Ships,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/captainsandcruiseships.html,"I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you",P:  ,happy

The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you
I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep
They wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask for me
Open up the gate for you
I want you, I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you.

Now all my fathers they've gone down
True love they've been without it
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter
I want you, I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you.

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn't very cute to him - Was I ?

Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hungover
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
And just what it was worth

And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable 
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through 
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world

And I feel like....

So I take my 
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving

Gypsy landslide

Like some modern-day

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/yourbodyisawonderland.html,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em

Last Christmas,Wham!,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wham/lastchristmas.html,"Happy Christmas

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone

I'll give it to someoneâ

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someoneâ
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someoneâ

I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someoneâ

You gave it away

Lady-lady glitters, but there's no gold.
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas.

Or is she bringing me on?

Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise

But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to

And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was) and she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
Drifting this way and that
Not touching ground at all
Up above the yard

[CHORUS]

She was glad about it... no doubt about it
She isn't sure where she's gone
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

Missing enough to feel alright (and she was)",1985,happy

I say, ""Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""

Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""

The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses

Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on

Oh girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocking through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the air-strip to the sunset 
Yeah ride the arrow to the target
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Fly the great big sky see the great big sea
Kick through continents bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness

I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good
And you might want to smile, smile, smile.

Don't you let your demons pull you down

The World at Large,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/theworldatlarge.html,"Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud.",2004,happy

They're like,
""Alright""
What ya saying,
""Yeah can I take your digits?""
And you're like, ""no not in a million years, you're nasty
please leave me alone.""

Cut to the pub on our last night out,
Man at the bar cos it was his shout,
Clocks this bird and she looks OK,
Caught him looking and she walks his way,
""Alright darling, you gonna buy us a drink then?""
""Err no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend...""

She's got no taste hand on his waist, tries to pull away but her lips on his face,
""If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer""
""Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture.""

Can't knock em out, can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you can't have my number,
""Why?""
Because I've lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant, having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah...

""I recognize this guy's way of thinking...""
As he comes over her face starts sinking,
She's like,
""Oh here we go..""
It's a routine check that she already knows, she's thinking: ""They're all the same.""

""Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?""
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag, tries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light,
""Here use mine""
""You see the thing is I just don't have the time.""

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?
Go away now I've made myself clear,
Nah it's not gonna happen,

Just touched down in London town.

Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
Yes.
Tell the promoter we need more seats.
We just sold out all the floor seats.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.

He said, ""Hey, sister.
It's really, really nice to meet you.""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type.
Like the way he's speaking,
His confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans
But I'm 'a like what's underneath them.

And, no, I ain't been to MIA.
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake.
First let's see the West End.
I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm liking this American boy, American boy.

Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping, maybe, then we'll go to a cafÃ©.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.

Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneakers looking fresh to death.
I'm loving those Shell Toes.
Walking that walk.
Talk that slick talk.

Everybody gonna say, ""You, K.""
Reluctantly 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me.

Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool. Oww, oww.
Ain't nothing new now now.

He crazy. I know what you thinking.
Ribena I know what you're drinking.
Rap singer. Chain blinger.
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking.

What's your persona
About this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer.

Dressed smart like a London bloke.
Yes.
Before he speak his suit bespoke.
And you thought he was cute before.
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke.

And I know you ain't into all that.
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that cash
'Cause a lot of wags wanna hear it.

And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest.
Like The Pips at they Gladys.
And I know they love it.

Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy

Shot callers, what are you, a preacher?

Until we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard 'til they sparked

What else can I say?
(Can I say)
My heart is beating double time, yeah
And do you feel the same?
(Do you feel the same)
Don't leave me in the dark, no
But baby don't put out this spark, no
I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Caught in the inquisition
Under these conditions
I need a definition
Is it love that we're sharing?
Show me that you're caring
You see my fascination
Tell me I'm not mistaken
Give me the information I need

1, 2, 3

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Baby, please don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Baby, please don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Baby, please don't let me go (Don't let me go)
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no",2010,happy
Goodness Gracious,Ellie Goulding,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliegoulding/goodnessgracious.html,"I lost a signal and put you away
Swore upon my sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosened the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back it has to go

I keep calling your name
(Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close
But I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night
(Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close
I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

I found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you til a
Nightless day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

I keep calling your name
(Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close
But I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night
(Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close
I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

Oh my goodness here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand
Cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms",2013,happy
Don't Bother,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/dontbother.html,"She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free

She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got the perfect friends
Oh isn't she cool

She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me

Hey hey

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry

And don't bother
I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

I'm sure she doesn't know
How to touch you like I would
I beat her at that one good
Don't you think so?

She's almost 6 feet tall
She must think I'm a flea
I'm really a cat you see
And it's not my last life at all

Hey hey

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry

Don't bother
I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

For you, I'd give up all I own
And move to a communist country
If you came with me, of course
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
And lose those pounds, and learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

So don't bother,
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry

And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry

So don't bother,
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry

And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type, not your type, not your type, not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry",2005,happy
Superstition,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/superstition.html,"Very superstitious, writings on the wall, 
Very superstitious, ladders 'bout to fall, 
Thirteen-months-old baby broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way 

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands, 
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can, 
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong, 
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way, yeah, yeah 

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say, 
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way, 
Thirteen-months-old baby broke the lookin' glass, 
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past 

When you believe in things that you don't understand,

Saturday in the Park,Chicago,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chicago/saturdayinthepark.html,"Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs
Eh cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar (play a song, play a song, play on)
Singing for us all (singing for us)
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost
Oh no, no

Forty days in the park
And every day's the Fourth of July 
Forty days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, people touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all (waiting for us all)
If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day
Yeah, yeah, yeah",1972,happy
Banquet,Bloc Party,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blocparty/banquet.html,"A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away

A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out
And why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light
Becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy
To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
No, no, no she don't think straight

She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

Turning away from the light
Becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy
To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

And if you feel a little left behind
We will wait for you on the other side

And if you feel a little left behind
We will wait for you on the other side

'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire when you come
'Cause you know I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire so stomp me out
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire",P:  ,happy
My British Tour Diary,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/mybritishtourdiary.html,"On our trip to England I noticed something obscene
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
and Brighton's lovely in the Fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
Paul and Sorrel too
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley

Performing with the Apples
and then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
because we hadn't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station

Up to our necks in crisps and litter
in the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter",2004,happy

The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

Our house it has a crowd
There's always something happening
And it's usually quite loud
Our mum she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down
And a mess is not allowed

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

Our house, in the middle of our street

Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt
Then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss
She's the one they're going to miss
In lots of ways

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

I remember way back then when
Everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time
Such a fine time
Such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play
Simply waste the day away
Then we'd say
Nothing would come between us
Two dreamers

Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house, was our castle and our keep
Our house, in the middle of our street
