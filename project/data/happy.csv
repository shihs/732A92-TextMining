Yellow Submarine,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/yellowsubmarine.html,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

She knows how to rock-n-roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready

Hey Man (Now You're Really Living),Eels,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eels/heymannowyourereallyliving.html,"Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

Made you feel like it's not such a bad world

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what

Never used to give me much of a thrill
But hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh cut grass
And thought about the moment and when it will pass
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what
This life is all about

Now what would you say if i told you that
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat

And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

Made you feel like it's not such a bad world

In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea

Through smeared mascara

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

The rest of the summer was the best we've ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forevermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

And we would too

And my dear dear dear Khalana

Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Great DJ,The Ting Tings,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tingtings/greatdj.html,"Fed up with your indigestion.
Swallow words one by one.

who said he had some songs to play.

gave hope and a brand new day.

Oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
gotta love the BPM.
When the smoke was all baton
Remembering how this begun.
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
Where the future plays it all night long.

Penny Lane,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/pennylane.html,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Spaceman,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/spaceman.html,"It started with a low light.
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed,
And then they took my blood type.
It left a strange impression in my head.

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind,
But when they cut me open,
I guess, I changed my mind.

And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name.

And the zipping white light beams,
Disregarding bombs and satellites.

That was the turning point.
That was one lonely night.

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad.""

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live.
You know it's gonna haunt me.
So hesitation to this life I give.

You think you might cross over.
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.
You better look it over
Before you make that leap.

And you know I'm fine,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes.
They justify my claim.

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised.

But it was the turning point.
Oh, what a lonely night!

The dream maker's gonna make you mad.

Dancing Queen,ABBA,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/abba/dancingqueen.html,"Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance

Where they never close

You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over

With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Oh, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody love me,
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""

Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

What you and I spoke of

Others only read of the love, the love that I love.

Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice

You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

Whistle for the Choir,The Fratellis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fratellis/whistleforthechoir.html,"Well it's a big big city and it's always the same
Can never be too pretty tell me your name
Is it out of line if I was to be bold to say ""Would you be mine""?

Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen
I know I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream
Though it's 3 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk.

So if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye,
A girl like you's just irresistible

Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out
But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces
And my head's a mess
And it's 4 in the morning, and I'm walking along
Beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong
And it's you, woo hoo
That's got me going crazy for the things you do

So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me
But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
And only a girl like you could be lonely
And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
A boy like me's just irresistible

So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me no you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try oh my, you caught my eye

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita, maid, ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid, Rita meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh Lovely Rita meter meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)

Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life

My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight

I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick

My Rollercoaster,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/myrollercoaster.html,"You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
And if home is really where the heart is
Then we're the smartest kids I know
Because wherever we are in this great big world
We'll never be more than a few hours from home... 

And that's important because I need to travel
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And before I had a mini van I road the greyhound bus
My mom would say ""i hope some day you get paid for being kimya dawson"" 

And now I do and it's not much
But it's enough
I've got my scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy 

On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again 

From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be do do do do do do
I'll be the greatest man of your life 

'cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes
And playing video games in the middle of the night
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride it'll be out of sight
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Four five six seven minutes in the closet 

You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
You know just when to jump off
You're so brave
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight 

Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
As long as it keeps goin' round it's unbelievable

A Sentence Of Sorts In Kongsvinger,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/asentenceofsortsinkongsvinger.html,"I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in Norway
I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
Just slept way too much, just slept

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me

I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
While trying to restructure my character
Because it had become vile to its creator
And through many dreadful nights
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
And waiting for some high times to come again

My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile

Don't play your games with me

If you don't hurt me then you die

We rarely practice discern
We make love to some weird sin
We seek out the taciturn

Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walked to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet

Two kids, a dog and then a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man.

He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he'd newly found
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Don't let the stars get you down.
Don't let the waves let you drown.
Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Oh Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go.
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind.
Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind.

And on his journey and his travels on the way,
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say,
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind.
Oh Billy Brown you are a victim of the times.

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Don't let the stars get you down.
Don't let the waves let you drown.
Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
Oh Billy Brown.

Brown... oh Billy Brown.
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
Gonna shake the water out of every nook.

Two kids, a dog and then a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man",2007,happy

I can't forget the time or place

I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware

Me back again

The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite

No song that I could sing

Our dreams,
And they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer.
At least for most of the questions in my heart.
Like: ""Why are we here?"", ""And where do we go?"",
""And how come it's so hard?"".
It's not always easy,
And sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing:
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do

But if all of these dreams
Might find their way into my day-to-day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me

You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I swap the bruising for a bumping sensation
I'll be Ctrl-Alt-deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting

I'm just thankful to be facing the day.
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone.

One hundred telephones shake and ring
One of those was someone who knew you

And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling

When they could never have persuaded me,
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools

I Don't Feel Like Dancin',Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/idontfeellikedancin.html,"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what you done?'
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one.
You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns.
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile.
You got so many colours, make a blind man so confused.
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So, I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
So, please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No, sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound.
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light.

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway

Just these three miserable cunts

although your husband may cut us
he is an animal
though everything is possible

give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
it's hard to miss you when you follow us about
buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
we'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

And it's
clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
you can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
these are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on...

Though the girls love us we're so
into you incredibly

we'd love to hate you but we don 't have no choice

I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable

What I Got,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/whatigot.html,"Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot

Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity
Love is what I got
It's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served
Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got

(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

Telepathic beautiful creature 
Understanding all of my weakness 
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it 

Cynical and hurt was just me

Took so long to finally see

Good Day,Nappy Roots,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nappyroots/goodday.html,"Let's begin now

Know today, I woke up this morning, and I said
You know, instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around, through ups and downs, waitin' on somethin' to happen
I just said...

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good, change the colors to my phone
Orange Kool-Aid go good with Patron
Oh no, hell no, boy is still my ring tone
Free car wash, had to clean up the Dodge
Give back when I can, just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry, mustard, hot sauce
Light bread and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bop
Last night, hit the pick three, bought some Air Force Ones
Four tall tees, man I'm loving B.G.

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

And I ain't finna worry 'bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground, and that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up, now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks, say I'm headed their way
Heard my cousin cookin' out, I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit, ain't even out in the States
So if I ain't speakin' too soon, but this a hell of a day
And this sticky got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My new grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm A-ok

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today

Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Skinny DeVille:]
We might as well do exactly what the children sayin'
Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few, and put up your deuce
If it's beef, put down the peace down, throw up your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your √¢¬Ä¬î
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind
Forever and a day, the choice you make is really all fine

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day

We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

That it's never too late
To get up and go

Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house!
Burn down the street!
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye",1992,happy

Born to Run,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/borntorun.html,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines

Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby, we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider

But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide

Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 

And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Come on, Wendy, tramps like us

Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Can't wait for tomorrow

I'll tear my heart out

To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

To let go of the hand that has been 
Clinging by its thick country skin
To my yellow country teeth

Far - Far away from West Virginia

Explaining that the sky holds the

With a shotgun can shoot down
Honeybees that sting
BUT THIS BOY COULD USE A LITTLE STING!

Who - Do I have yet to meet?
You - You look a bit like coffee
And you taste a bit like me
How - Can I keep me from moving?

Understand the movement of the wind
Or the waves out in the ocean or how

I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/imyours.html,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
There's no need to complicate.
'Cause our time is short.

Watching the fire as we grow old

And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

In his dad's closet, boy, in a box of fun things

He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?""

Accidentally in Love,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/accidentallyinlove.html,"So she said what's the problem baby
What's the problem I don't know
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
Think about it every time
I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it

How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
Because everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love

Well baby I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love

These lines of lightning
Mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, Come on
Move a little closer
Come on, Come on
I want to hear you whisper
Come on, Come on
Settle down inside my love

Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once
Upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love

Always the same

I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now

So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away
Listen to me, I'm not
Although I'm dressed up, out and all with
Everything considered they forget my name
(ame, ame, ame)

[Chorus]

[Jules in the background:]
This song was in my head, now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
Though I realize, I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around, but just a promise, nothing binding
However can't you see, that you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-along, this song is monotone
I gotta get some soul, gotta get some feeling....

Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?
Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?

And make the fireflies dance

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

When we can say goodnight and stay together

In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

Time to Pretend,MGMT,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mgmt/timetopretend.html,"I'm feeling rough I'm feeling raw I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars

This is our decision to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We were fated to pretend, to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We were fated to pretend, to pretend

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah",P:  ,happy
Fidelity,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/fidelity.html,"(Shake it up)

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind all this music

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

And suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose we never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall

All my friends say that of course it's gonna get better
Gonna get better
Better better better better
Better better better

I never love nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost
In the sounds

Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day

So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hair do

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
All twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say
What you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Keeping versed and on my feet

Well, I, ""Jared, I love you!""

[Sharon:]
I was lying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws
Out of big fat Slurpee treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

From ten thousand lightning bugs

A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain

I just wanna write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
OK
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast, I'm
Driving too far. I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
A yellow lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

Sing: dah...

I'm sitting here, I miss the power, I'd like to go out,
Taking a shower, but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed, where nothing ever
Happens - and I wonder.

Isolation - is not the good for me.
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy. Baby anyhow I'll get
Another toy and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.

'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
Another lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down

That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch,
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio,
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening

And that frankly will not fly.
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,

And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were its not the scene you're thinking of
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion

It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
If only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing

And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Says as long as we're here everything is alright

And I always get confused,
because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
but in discos they turn them on.
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.

Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels its always near

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

(and while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the
Birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)

Unwritten,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/unwritten.html,"I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Brown Eyed Girl,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/browneyedgirl.html,"Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah.

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing

Laying in the green grass

Crawling on your knees toward it

But it's sending me shivers

Crying out for attention

Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decisions to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not

So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain
That there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away,
But it's a great escape
Escape... escape... escape...

Semi-Charmed Life,Third Eye Blind,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thirdeyeblind/semicharmedlife.html,"Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said...

How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive,
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress one

And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else to get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I was taking sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)

Dancing in the deepest oceans

I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Listened as the crowd would sing,

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

No!

Born to, born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies,
All you want's one more Saturday.

Well, look here, until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air
And your feet in the fetters
'Til the day...
They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes.

You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with a dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried.

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands,
You keep 'em folded in your lap,
Or raise them up to beg for scraps,
You know, he's holding you down
With the tips of his fingers just the same,
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late,
Or changed by a potion,
And find a handsome young mate
For you to love.

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe,
Well do it now or grow old,
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.

Been alone since you were twenty-one,
You haven't laughed since January,
You try and make like this is so much fun,
But we know it to be quite contrary.

Dare to be one of us, girl,
Facing the android's conundrum,
I felt like I should just cry,
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,
You're Himmler in your coat,
You don't know how long I have been,
Watching the lantern dim,
Starved of oxygen,
So give me your hand,
And let's jump out the window.",2007,happy

Wipe the sleep out of my eyes

As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

Daylight,Matt & Kim,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mattkim/daylight.html,"We cut the legs off of our pants
Threw our shoes into the ocean
Sit back and wave through the daylight

Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight
Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself

Maybe I'll paint them in myself [x4]

These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight
It rings like all through the daylight

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
I'll just unplug it for today

Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight

And float down Grand Street in daylight [x4]

New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time

Dog Days Are Over,Florence + the Machine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florencethemachine/dogdaysareover.html,"Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back

She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it, she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind

She's crawling out her window 'cause her daddy

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you gave us quite a scare

Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray,

Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid,
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

And look me in the eyes. Take off that stupid fitted cap.

Pumpkin Soup,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/pumpkinsoup.html,"You're chatting to me, like we connect
But I don't even know if we're still friends
It's so confusing,
Understanding you is making me not want to do

And things that I know I should do
But I trip fast and then I lose
And I hate looking like a fool

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss

The lights are on
And someone's home
I'm not sure if they're alone
There's someone else inside my head
Living there too fills me with dread

This paranoia is distressing
But I spend most of my night guessing
Are we not, are we together
Will this make our lives much better

I'm not in love
I just wanna be touched

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
Whoops I think I've got too close
'Cause now he's telling me I'm girl that he likes most
Now I messed up it's not the first time
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss",2007,happy

Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do

Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

I really don't think it gets any better than this

And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again?
I know we should!!!

I'm so fizzy I could burst!
You wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow! it feels so big it almost hurts!

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more?

Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this
Forever and ever and ever...

Hey Julie,Fountains of Wayne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fountainsofwayne/heyjulie.html,"Working all day for a mean little man

You're always there to rub my back

Hey Julie,
Look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up
Trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
And I'd never make it through without you around

Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of papers that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Counting down the hours 'til I get to see your face

Hey Julie,
Look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up
Trying to wear me down

How did it come to be
That you and I must be
Far away from each other every day?
Why must I spend my time
Filling up my mind
With facts and figures that never add up anyway?
They never add up anyway

Working all day for a mean little guy
With a bad toupee and a soup-stained tie
He's got me running 'round the office
Like a gerbil on a wheel
He can tell me what to do
But he can't tell me what to feel

Look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up

just when you think that you've got a hold,
just when you get on a roll,
here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,
but here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.

It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy, something inching past the edge of the reserve.
Now through lines of the cheap venetian blinds your car is pulling off of the curb.

Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/bowloforanges.html,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002,happy

Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas

Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh",2008,happy
Mouthwash,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/mouthwash.html,"This is my face
Covered in freckles
With the occasional spot
And some veins

This is my body
Covered in skin
And not all of it
You can see

And, this, is my mind
It goes over and over
The same old lines

And, this, is my brain
It's torturous analytical thoughts
Make me go insane

And I use mouthwash
Sometimes I floss
I got a family
And I drink cups of tea

I've got nostalgic pavements
I've got familiar faces
I've got a mixed-up memory
And I've got favourite places

And I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night
And I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night
And I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright
And I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright

This is my face
I've got a thousand opinions
And not the time to explain

And this is my body
And no matter how you try and disable it
Yes I'll still be here

And, this, is my mind
And although you try to infringe
You cannot confine

And, this, is my brain
And even if you try and hold me back
There's nothing that you can gain

'Cause I use mouthwash
Sometimes I floss
I've got a family
And I drink cups of tea

I've got nostalgic pavements
I've got familiar faces
I've got a mixed-up memory
And I've got favourite places

I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night
And I'm singing ""oh oh"" on a Friday night

Digital Love,Daft Punk,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/digitallove.html,"Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right
To put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do!

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wondered
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Sleepyhead,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/sleepyhead.html,"And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going

And you said
It was like fire around the brim
Burning solid
Burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I dragged you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

Go ahead",P:  ,happy
Upside Down,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/upsidedown.html,"Who's to say
What's impossible
Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
I don't want this feeling to go away

New Shoes,Paolo Nutini,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paolonutini/newshoes.html,"Woke up cold one Tuesday,
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick,
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life,
So I quickly opened the wardrobe,
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean,
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes,
That were ripped around the seams,
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me.

[Chorus:]
Hey, I put some new shoes on,
And suddenly everything is right,
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling,
It's so inviting,
Oh, short on money,
But long on time,
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
And I'm running late,
And I don't need an excuse,
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.

Woke up late one Thursday,
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes,
And I felt like there were two days missing,
As I focused on the time,
And I made my way to the kitchen,
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found,
A room full of all off my friends all dancing round and round,
And I thought hello new shoes,
Bye bye them blues.

[Chorus]

Take me wandering through these streets,
Where bright lights and angels meet,
Stone to stone they take me on,
I'm walking till' the break of dawn. [x2]

Blended angels, whispered love
Countdown 'til it's gone, for long
Velvet voices, haunting slow
Darkened nooks, with bright decor
Georgian femmes are gone for weeks

I'm staring down the Eppley gate
Two more days before the plane arrives
And you'll be standing here with your smile
Carving up the lobby seats
Pushing down the caffeine drinks
Checking the arrival screens for yours

A hundred feet above the landing
There's a girl gliding down
She's floating toward me now
Her sleeves are all stretching out
And the jet is following behind

Wake up

London skids a grinding halt
Last night left to spend apart
Your bags are packed but now for home
Stories of the tour unfold

Butting heads with creeping dolts

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slipping dues down to see

That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below

Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules,
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

I've gotta have you, I've gotta have you.

The road gets cold, there's no spring in the meadow this year
I'm the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears
Oh, such a prima donna, sorry for myself
But green, it is also summer
And I won't be warm 'til I'm lying in your arms

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine
No, no, no, no, no
Nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have you

I see it all through a telescope: guitar, suitcase, and a warm coat
Lying in the back of the blue boat, humming a tune...hmmmmmmm

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no wine
No, no, no, no, no
Nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have

You Were Always the One,The Cribs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cribs/youwerealwaystheone.html,"I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out

It's all about escaping

Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get trouble with that

You're gonna get trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one

And I hope to be free
But I guess that you've heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?

Got to find me a place in the sun

Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea

Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you",2008,happy

I need to get away to feel again.
Try to understand why,
don't get so close to change my mind.
Please wipe that look out of your eyes,
it's bribing me to doubt myself;
Simply, it's tiring.

This love has dried up and stayed behind,
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide.
Excuse me first love, but we're through.
I need to taste a kiss from someone new.

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.

You had all the answers but no human touch

If life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up

So busy showing me where I'm wrong
You forgot to switch your feelings on, (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So, so superior, are you not
You love a little bit but you forgot

Goodbye Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch

If life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up

Goodbye Mr. A
Goodbye Mr. A

Goodbye Mr. A
The world was full of wonder until you opened my eyes
Goodbye Mr. A
Wish you hadn't blown my mind and killed the surprise

Goodbye Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch

Your life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction

My Best Friend,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/mybestfriend.html,"When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue

You are such a blessing and I wont be messing 
with the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness

You are my best friend
and I love you, and I love you
Yes I do

There is no other one that can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because I speak sincerely
and I mean it when I tell you I need you

You are my best friend
and I love you, and I love you

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you

No Man's Land,Sufjan Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sufjanstevens/nomansland.html,"Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours; this land is mine.
I see the Captain in red,
and Cairo at his head.
This land is yours; this land is mine.

The lightning over the park,
the waters--brash and dark
We take a swim; we take a swim.
I never meant to escape
the carpet and the trade
This land is yours; this land is mine.

And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back; I take it back.
The numbers over the dam,
Jo Davies and the band,
I count them out; I count them out.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
to the floor

The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
In Charles, we climb the hill 
and Danville window sill
I take it back; I take it back.
My sister she counts the bars,
the Macon county cars,
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.

The Mississippi amends
the Carver and the bends
This land is yours; this land is mine.
My brother punches my ear.
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad; I call my dad.
We skip inside of the store
the Mason winter door
This land is yours; this land is mine.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can,
ransacks with the mad man.
For this land is not yours or mine to have.
This land was made for the good of itself.)",2006,happy
Freckles,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/freckles.html,"I used to care so much about what others think about
Almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark
On the journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
If I knew then what I know now
I would have told myself don't worry any longer it's OK

[Chorus:]
'cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable,
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me
Sometimes I still feel like the little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm getting better
And I'm reminding myself

[Chorus]

Reflecting who you are
Reflecting who you are
Hmmm
Whoooooo whoa hmmmm oooooo

I would do it all over again

You said ""Hey, what's your name?""
It took one look
And now I'm not the same
Yeah you said ""Hey""
And since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I-I-I

I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

I'm All Over It,Jamie Cullum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiecullum/imalloverit.html,"Hello Innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing
How I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one
And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please

Let me go
Don't you know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I tried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

She's a melody
That I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me
When I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't fight
That song going round in my head
Like the last things you said

Please don't go
You think I know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change but I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back

One dark morning
She left without a warning
And took the red-eye back to London town

I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now

I'm all over it now

Yeah you

You had a dark, sexy vibe about ya
And in a strange way you turn me on

As if you really didn't give a-unh!
I told myself not to fall for you
'Cause I can see that you don't follow rules
I should've just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on

It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

A real rebel kinda fella
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a-hey!
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls though they try
It's if they just can't stay away

Girls they want to watch them ride

Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember

We felt like fighters when we caught the plane
Until that day we'd never heard its name
We did some things we didn't understand
And now we feel like strangers in our own land

Headstart For Happiness,The Style Council,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stylecouncil/headstartforhappiness.html,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.",1983,happy

Or wherever to get away from me

I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me

I'll be there for you

My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

See somthing I want then I just take and make it mine

I likc my lips and then just think how sweet it is to be me
So to date me must be hot
Well if you gon keep hanging round
U gone have to figure out
Cause there

Ain't no defense
When I'm calling
Red hot scowling
And I'm calling 4 u.. what else can u do

Oh I 
I don't think you realize
That u
U don't even have a chance
When I
Spit my G @ u I bet u won't know how 2 act
(act) it's that bad
(act) I lick my lips and then I think about how sweet my touch is baby
So to feel me must be hot (hot)
So if you didn't know you know now
exactly how it's going down

Don't Deconstruct,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/dontdeconstruct.html,"Something is changing inside of me
Colors seem darker in light
And i don't know what that means
But it's not a good sign

You can just add them upthen you could memorize prehistoric bones
All of those old memories you can push them out and prep yourself for brand new information

Don't deconstruct and then fill me in
I'm not that basic i swear
I've had enough of break downs and diagrams

Judging from picture books apparently heaven is a partly cloudy place
And if the sky opened up and they let you in and gave you a formal invitation
Would you go?
You can work for home",2001,happy
Better Make It Better,Swing Out Sister,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/swingoutsister/bettermakeitbetter.html,"Take it fast, take is slow

For that final blow

Better use your wits or you'll lose your mind...
There's a world to discover and you're running
Out of time
Life's a roller coaster ride
That took you by surprise
Now you're burnin' up inside

Better make it better
Better make it better
Better make it better

You can scream you can shout
But when your time runs out
Deep inside you'll know
May be rich, may be poor
But when you knock at Heaven's door
Well you have to go

Make the most of what you've got
For it's better than to not have anything at all
Take each day as it's your last
Or you'll find the future's passed and you're left
With nothing at all

Better make it better
Better make it better
Better make it better

Dog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and me

All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)
Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""

Dreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbed
(Long dead rows of daffodils and marigolds)
Changing her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said,

It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, every time I see my little boy child.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, sometimes I even jump for joy, child.
He knows just how to make me happy, he gives me loves and calls me Daddy.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, c'mon giggle for me.

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall. It just blows me away to be part of it all.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, just singing these love songs for you.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, there ain't nothing that I'd rather do.
I like to see you with a smile on your face, I'd like to give one to the whole human race

Everybody has their fight

No, don't let it take your light

Make it what you want it to be
If you're listening to me now
Set your inner spirit free

Cupid,Sam Cooke,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/samcooke/cupid.html,"Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, if your arrow make her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid
Don't you hear me
Calling you?
I need you

Oslo In The Summertime,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/oslointhesummertime.html,"Oslo in the summertime; nobody can fall asleep, staring out the window from my bed.
At 4 A.M., the sun is up. Look, the sky is peppered with sea birds and with crows all cackling.

Up in treten Heimdalsgate, me and Nina making fun of footballers in Rudolf Nilsen Plass.
I practice my Norwegian on poor befuddled waitresses, who shake their heads completely at a loss.
Oslo in the summertime -- the streets are strangely quiet 'cause everyone's away on holiday.

Oslo in the summertime; Pakistani children play locked inside of the courtyard all day.
Pretty people everywhere, sun-lamp tans and flaxen hair -- just tell the American not to stare.",2005,happy

We'll pick berries and recline
Let's hit the road dear friend of mine
Wave goodbye to our thankless jobs
We'll drive for miles maybe never turn off
We'll find a cathedral city you can be handsome I'll be pretty

Everyone else thinks it's the bee's knees
What does this city have to offer me?
I just can't see

Smell the Jasmine my head was turned

Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me

It's all the same, save the shame for me

I didn't believe in destiny.

Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine;
And it's brighter than sunshine.

I never saw it happening.
I'd given up and given in.
I just couldn't take the hurt again -
What a feeling.

I didn't have the strength to fight.
Suddenly, you seemed so right.
Me and you -
What a feeling.

But give me your hand, and you will see.
Your heart is keeping time with me.

Which will refresh my broken mind

I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke

And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

√¢¬Ä¬òCause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again",2009,happy
Existentialism On Prom Night,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/existentialismonpromnight.html,"When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,

And when the gas runs out, just wreck it, you insured the thing

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in

It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star

Forget the caffe latte,

A Malibu and Coke for you, a G&T for me
Alcohol, Your songs resolve like
my life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill

I love you more than I did the week before

For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

I thought that Alcohol was just for those with
nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time
and there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
self-control and self-abuse

found me on the floor
Trying on your camisole?

We're overrated, anyway.

We're kissing without kissing... got it down to a fine art.
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky; we grew up and wide apart.
Not now, not ever, no... it's never a good time.
How will the good times ever roll along?
Comparing photos then and now.
Just wondering...wondering...where it all went wrong.

If I sliced you up real itty bitty

And I'm pretty sure, baby, if you'd hold my head
I could live like I've wished for and undo my dread
Cause I see candygrams up in the ceiling tiles
Witty postcards sent off from the sandwich aisles
And these towns where vacations will lead us
I'll hold out my treasures and their welfare feed us
But oh she does what she wishes
And, no, she won't be your missus
The kingdom it widens and no, they're alone with all that love and the void on your throne

I found the answer lookin' in your eye

Take away this lonely man soon he will be gone

Yes I can see you girl can you see me

You don't need to know what I do all day
It's as much as I know watch it waste away

'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl can you see me

Go and see the sorcerer look into the ball
You may find the answer written on the wall
The left one was a dancer can you see the answer, oh!

Put her in a mansion on top of the hill
Please don't make her do things against her will
I found something special I don't know why
Looking into her pretty little eye

'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free",2006,happy
Horchata,Vampire Weekend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vampireweekend/horchata.html,"In December drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

(Whoaaaaa ooooh)

In December drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

(Whoaaaaaa ooooh)

You'd remember drinkin horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on masada

Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Ooh you had it but oh no you lost it
Lookin back you shouldn't have fought it

In December, drinkin horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Falling down and nearing the rose beds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh you had it but oh no you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on",2010,happy
San Francisco,Foxygen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/foxygen/sanfrancisco.html,"Up in the San Francisco where the forest meets the bridge
I thought I saw you standing there and then you fell into the well
But that was many years ago and I am so much older now
My brother is a soldier now
I can't see them anyhow, I moved up in the wind
And you swimming up tide or just tuning in radio stations

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in a field
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

And we're restating on this hill
That Jesus came from Israel
Isaac followed the sacred cow
So not to wake a sparrow splashing mud

But that was many years from now
And I hope from here on now
That I always seem to want to shout
Your eyes are like a cup of tea
You're sending to the sun with me

You swimming upstream or just tune into new sensations
I was broken, you were broken

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

Birds of a Feather,Phish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phish/birdsofafeather.html,"It's easy sometimes when you just coast along
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
Of ritual drumming although at first glance
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance

It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
They hang on emotions they bottle inside
They peck at the ground
And strut out of stride",1998,happy

At whose blind word
So clear but so unheard

I've been waiting

It's just a matter of time

To appear sad
With the same old decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Lost and loaded
Still the same old decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate

The room the sun and the sky

Songs of Love,The Divine Comedy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/divinecomedy/songsoflove.html,"Pale, pubescent beasts
Roam through the streets
And coffee shops
Their prey gather in herds
Of stiff knee-length skirts
And white ankle socks
But while they search for a mate
My type hibernate
In bedrooms above
Composing their songs of love

Young, uniform minds
In uniform lines
And uniform ties
Run round with trousers on fire
And signs of desire
They cannot disguise
While I try to find words
As light as the birds
That circle above
To put in my songs of love

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you have time
Let the sun shine down from above
And fill you with songs of love
Take me

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So let's sing while we still can
While the sun hangs high up above
Wonderful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love",1996,happy

The Good Left Undone,Rise Against,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/riseagainst/thegoodleftundone.html,"In fields where nothing grew but weeds,
I found a flower at my feet,
Bending there in my direction,
I wrapped a hand around its stem,
I pulled until the roots gave in,
Finding there what I'd been missing,

But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

Inside my hands these petals browned,
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now.
I pushed my fingers through the earth,
Returned this flower to the dirt,
So it could live. I walked away now.

But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long,
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

All because of you...
All because of you...

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
Inside these arms of yours.

All because of you,
I believe in angels.
Not the kind with wings,
No, not the kind with halos,
The kind that bring you home,
When home becomes a strange place.

All you have to do is shout it out.",2006,happy

So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969,happy
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/maninashed.html,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969,happy

Because I sold off my personal property

We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea,
We sold some ecstasy,
We sold nitrus, opium, acid, heroin and PCP

I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one",1970,happy
Sympathy For The Martyr,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/sympathyforthemartyr.html,"You just can't relax,
And you can't rely,
On anyone for anything,
So you make your complaints,
And all everyone's let you down,
You just cant,
Ever win,
Convinced there's a war on,
It's always everybody versus you,
Convinced that your critics are watching,
And you've always got something,
You've always got something to prove,

So tie the noose,
And raise the cross,
The martyr's arrived,
A desperate plea for sympathy,
It's all you'll need,

A laundry list of problems,
Doesn't make you interesting,
And never getting help doesn't make you brave,
Not listening to reason doesn't mean that you have faith,
Your just cutting off your nose to spite your face,

So tie the noose,
And raise the cross,
The martyr's arrived,
A desperate plea for sympathy,
It's all you'll need!

And you want it all
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,
You want it, you want it all,

If Not for You,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/ifnotforyou.html,"If not for you, babe, I couldn't find the door
Couldn't even see the floor

If not for you, baby, I'd lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it will not be new if not for you.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
Oh what would I do if not for you ?

Dispatch the Troops,Matisyahu,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/dispatchthetroops.html,"Daughter of Zion
Once precious princess
Left her father's house
To walk the streets that never rest
Maybe they'll hear me in the metropolis
So I'm sending out and SOS
Fighting with her ""ta""
She wants out of this mess
And those big city lights
Might brighten up the darkness
You know that I'm tired and you know that I'm stressed
You can't stop me and you can't stop this
You could call the police try to make an arrest
Today is the day that repossess
Leaving on the first bus that I can get
Now its rings around the eyes sopping wet from rain droplets
Window shopping for some solace
No address and penniless
Thats the price you pay from running away from the stress
Feeling the pain likes the dance by the DJ
Reminds me of a time when things were OK
Frightened by her own shadow
Now she wants to go home
Many names for one God
Trotting on through the facade
You were all my children
Got a dig for that feeling
Love will break through the concealment
Strip away the serpents skin
We came to win
Dispatch the troops
Send out the captain
My gem is held captive in the dungeon
Don't come back again until you end the mission
If it takes a long time
Don't lose the vision
If you're stuck
Check the blueprint
Look within
Reflection
Got to find the rhythm
Won't you please return child
Where you been?
She says I can't come home because he won't let me in
And besides we don't need no more friction
Used to look so nice how'd you get so thin?
With a heart of ice it's a heart of sin
Skin white like a ghost with a pale complexion
Pray to God for the dead we need resurrection
Don't you know wherever you go thick and thin
You are still my children
Since you've been gone my soul's been hearting
Wondering through this world
We are all just boys and girls
Many names for God
Trotting on through the facade",2006,happy

Let me take you there

North of the river all the streets are the same

And the heat is turned all the way to full
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull

I am trying to say

You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
I really knew you

We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome

Do You Believe In Magic,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

And the market stalls are all filling up, spilling over the streets.

I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh-
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends-
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.
Yeah we will unravel, unravel the moments.

Oh...

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will come to your window.

I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
you were the last good thing about this part of town

When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
the hope I forget
that you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you (for you, so...)

You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
you were the last good thing about this part of town

Someday I'll appreciate in value
get off my ass and call you
In the meantime I'll sport my
brand new fashion of waking up with pants on
at four in the afternoon

You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

1-2-3-4!

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
you were the last good thing about this part of town

Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time

And begging down upon his bended knee

Tatters,Lou Reed,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loureed/tatters.html,"Some couples live in harmony
some do not
Some couples yell and scream
some do not

But what you said was something
that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not

Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters

But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
I suppose that we all could say
that nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
to see everything in tatters",2000,happy

The fool in me
It's like a dream, you see
But if the world is right
I'll drive all night
And meet you there someday

Six in the morning, never felt so sweet
Just put on Lucinda baby, and dance with me
I know I'm hard to count on
Forget half what I'm told
You probably only know my voice from
A goddam microphone

It's a waste
A teenage taste of me
But if Daddy cries
Just say goodnight
And I'll come
If I could change
I'd keep away the rain
And the sun would shine every night
And I'll come meet you there someday...

The Space Between,Valencia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/valencia/thespacebetween.html,"There's something strange going on in my head
That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing, so stare up at the clouds
And at least you know you're always looking up

So Casey can you remember (Do you remember)
Sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
And talking about life

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we'd stay inside just to watch the time go by
And sleep the whole day till the night
With everything you said
I'm sure you've got some place that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song and thinking about me

Carolina was waiting for you
It's what you always wanted

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away
Cause the sky looks different when you're in another state
It's everything I've always wanted
And everything I've worked so hard for

Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?
Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?

Well is it in me

The blood red on an empty street
It's not night, it's not day
It's no more, for an unfortunate soul who
Witnessed his life violently erased, 
From the horror of the human race
Bright futures exchanged for profit, living half alive

Because in death as in life

Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!

In life now pay respects to your blood
Those in the vast of the great
Unknown, unite there, your heart's one 
in moments you'll never forget, yeah
History lessons direct from the grave
Lost souls of the lost divide
Liberate your generation, living, rotting flesh

Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life

Call out tyranny!
A spark of dissent can light a fury of flame
Call out to be free!

Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation

Strip away! Be the voice of a generation
Strip away! You've got a choice to make
Cut away! Cut away!
Strip away! Strip away!
Cut away! Strip away your chains!

It's a last chance, when they've given up

I hope that you're ready now.

Get caught out in the rain. I hope you're ready now

It's a cheap date, when you're out of cash
It's a bad day, another bad day
It's a feeling, when you've lost your touch
It's a plane ride, if on the right drugs
And can you take it?
Honestly, I can't take it...

We'll fight the seconds inside every clock

I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl

[Bridge]
I could be reeling them in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

Then why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
The sound's off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world

[Outro]
(just a) she's just another girl,
Don't let her stick it to your heart, boy
(just a) she's just another girl
All of my friends say
(just a) she's just another girl
Another girl",,happy
Streets of Nowhere,Lostprophets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lostprophets/streetsofnowhere.html,"She won't let me go,
Don't put me down,
I've seen the scenes and I've been around.

Big city lies,
The bullshit smiles,
The inside jokes and the changing style.

But when I'm here,
I leave behind,
What I don't need
'Cause everytime I walk these streets I know they're mine.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything's ok.""

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Your faded signs,
Your tiny crime,
Your endless jokes that go on for miles

Your errant daughter,
Walks on water,
You wouldn't have a word said against her.

But I agree,
The factories,
The shopping carts sing a symphony,
That sounds like home to me.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything's ok.""

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Oooooooooooo,
Oooooooooooo.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,
Everything will be okay.""

These streets of nowhere!

Oh these roads they should talk,
Yeah, feels good just to walk,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere",2010,happy

Focusing on things that will make my feelings go up

Are so cute that I'm happy

Who only chase after that
They are truly unhappy
The world is filled with
Happy things and great things
That it's been a while since we stopped caring about
Money and power

I'm a little different
I just do what I want to do
If you just worry and become an adult
You'll have regrets

I'm happy that she ran over to me
And linked her arm in mine with a smile
The groups of boys who are always joking around

When I pass them

She may nag
But my mom says she loves me the most in this world
Hey hey, take out
Those adults who only fight on TV

I like it more and more
I'm happy that I'm me
What makes me even happier
Is that you're next to me

Uncatena,Sylvan Esso,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sylvanesso/uncatena.html,"I'm washing with all my friends in the kitchen
Drying dishes turning twisting until we can run out go swimming
I feel you behind me ringing bowls right next to my ears
Toe was so clear so that we all could hear when the water washed around us
Salty holding us steer

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

Skinny skinny skinny man with a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast to be swallowed let it last

I'm swimming with all my slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting
Limbs clenched so hard, mouth so resistant

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

All I want from you is a letter and to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time",2014,happy

Strange Encounter,Father John Misty,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fatherjohnmisty/strangeencounter.html,"Only ever be the girl who just almost died in my house
Half naked, looking through your telephone
Run you a bath and try hard not to freak out

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

Wanna find somebody
Not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Little aimless

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away

Humming,Turnover,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/turnover/humming.html,"Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young.
Positively unattached, 
Naive and unattracted to the buzz.
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song.
Show me why you're always smiling.
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space.
Drawn outside the lines,
your words, a vibrant illustration you create.

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole,
Deep down into an old slope.
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go,
Spinning out of control

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
The past was yours
But the future's mine
You're all out of time

I don't feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion fruit and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her here she comes

She bangs the drums

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard

The Magic Number,De La Soul,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delasoul/themagicnumber.html,"(Got to have soul!) 

[POS:]
3 
That's the Magic Number 
Yes it is 
It's the magic number 
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community 
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me 
And that's the magic number 

(What does it all mean?) 

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
Measure in my music, raised in three parts 
Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky 
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires 
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet 
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

Everybody wants to be a deejay 
Everybody wants to be an emcee 
But being speakers are the best 
And you don't have to guess 
De La Soul posse consists of three 
And that's the magic number 

[DOVE:]
This here piece of the pie 
Is not dessert but the course that we dine 
And three out of every darn time 
The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind 
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
When that negative number fills up the casualty 
Maybe you can subtract it 
You can call it your lucky partner 
Maybe you can call it your adjective 
But odd as it may be 
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
My 3 
Mase Pos and Me 
And that's the Magic Number 

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
Time is a factor so it's time to count 
Count not the negative actions of one 
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 

Now you may try to subtract it 
But it just won't go away 
Three times one? 
(What is it?) 
(One, two, three!) 
And that's the Magic Number 

(Yo, what's up?) 
(1, 2, 3) 
(I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
(I wouldn't lie to you) 
(No more no less, that's the magic number) 
(No more no less) 
(What it is?) 
(No more no less) 
(Is this the future?) 
(No more no less) 
(Do the shang-a-lang) 
(No more no less) 
(No one on the subway ever chats to me) 
(No more no less) 
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(Three feet high and rising) 
(No more no less) 
(Three) 
(That's the magic number)",1989,happy

To march down the street like the Duracell bunny

Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
Traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
'Cos he's fucking up even the simplest lines
They say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the streets I'll be the only shit that's left behind

Rainbowarriors,CocoRosie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cocorosie/rainbowarriors.html,"Of all the white horses

In these times of evil spirits
Of material thugs and mischief
Fearing Saint Noni's wisdom
And his love for rainbow spirits
Jealous of their faithful heart-bond
And their dancing and their laughing
Made at last a league against them
To molest them and destroy them
Saint Noni wise and heart-strong
Often said to Rainbowarrior
""O my brother, do not leave me!
Lest the evil spirits harm you!""
Rainbowarrior of two spirits
Gentle hand and lion-hearted
He laughed and then he answered
Like a child he softly whispered:

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears

He's dead, our sweetest mother
Loving father and our teacher
He's gone forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the master of all laughter
To the master of all song
O my brother, O my brother
Crystal brother of two spirits
Then we gathered in a circle
Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning ember's hearts united
We remember mystical beauty
If you look hard you can find a
Rainbow trail it's deep inside ya
Fear not you're a Rainbowarrior
Golden light on everything gleaming

Heart Attack,Sum 41,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sum41/heartattack.html,"Remember when there was nothing else to do,
But lie in bed
And wonder how it was always up to you
And no one else.
And early mornings,
Made by warnings,
What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining,
I'm not complaining,
But waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay.
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day,
And we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say,
'Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring,
Slept in mornings,
Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming.
It's not important
If days are shortened.
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

What's a day
When it all ends up the same
And lasts forever?
Can't complain
When there's nothing there to blame,
And things can't be better.

Summer evenings,
Teenage grievings,
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration
On hesitation,
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do

So, turn my head it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day,

A chimbley, chimbley sweep.""

My fortune's made, I'll shake you from your sleep

Bridges and Balloons,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/bridgesandballoons.html,"We sailed away on a winter's day
with fate as malleable as clay;
but ships are fallible, I say,
and the nautical, like all things, fades.

And I can recall our caravel:
a little wicker beetle shell
with four fine masts and lateen sails,
its bearings on Cair Paravel.

O my love,
O it was a funny little thing
to be the ones to've seen.

The sight of bridges and balloons
makes calm canaries irritable;
and they caw and claw all afternoon:
""Catenaries and dirigibles
brace and buoy the living-room √¢¬Ä¬î
a loom of metals, warp-woof-wimble.""
And a thimblesworth of milky moon
can touch hearts larger than a thimble.

Hounds Of Love,The Futureheads,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/futureheads/houndsoflove.html,"When I was a child, running in the night, i was afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark and hiding on the street, and of what was following me

The hounds of love are calling
I've always been a coward, and I don't know what's good for me

Well here I go,it's coming at me through the trees
Help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off, and i will throw them in the lake, and I will be, two steps on the water

I found a fox, who was caught by dogs, he let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed to be running away
From nothing real, i just can't deal with this
I feel ashamed to be there

Among your hounds of loving
And feel your arms surround me
I've always been a coward, and i dont know what's good for me

About making lots of money and such
And I always seemed to land upon my feet
And though there's been some difficult times
The good times were never far behind
I snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat

When I hold you in my arms

My charmed life

Baby, I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life

They broke my heart, and I broke theirs, too
And breaking up was so very hard to do
But I knew I'd find the one
And sure enough, she came along
And not long after that, along came you

Well, sometimes this life is like being afloat
On a raging sea in a little rowboat
Just trying not to be washed overboard
But if you take your chances and you ride your luck
And you never, never, never, never, never give up
Well, those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore

The Trapeze Swinger,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/thetrapezeswinger.html,"Please remember me, happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

The General,Dispatch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dispatch/thegeneral.html,"there was a decorated general with
a heart of gold, that likened him to
all the stories he told
of past battles, won and lost, and
legends of old a seasoned veteran in
his own time

on the battlefield, he gained
respectful fame with many medals
of bravery and stripes to his name
he grew a beard as soon as he could
to cover the scars on his face
and always urged his men on

but on the eve of a great battle
with the infantry in dream
the old general tossed in his sleep
and wrestled with its meaning
he awoke from the night
just to tell what he had seen
and walked slowly out of his tent

all the men held tall with their
chests in the air, with courage in
their blood and a fire in their stare
it was a grey morning and they all
wondered how they would fare
till the old general told them to go home

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

but the men stood fast with their
guns on their shoulders not knowing
what to do with the contradicting orders
the general said he would do his own
duty but would extend it no further
the men could go as they pleased

but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
till one by one
they stepped back and not a word was said
and the old general was left with his
own words echoing in his head
he then prepared to fight

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting, no
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living

Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom

Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home

she prays for days 
when boys mean she's protected 
and she wants someone to see her 
she needs to hear she's beautiful 
she's beautiful

save me too

An Old Fashioned Love Song,Three Dog Night,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/threedognight/anoldfashionedlovesong.html,"Just an old-fashioned love song 
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music 
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony

To weave our dreams upon and listen 
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings 
That we've come to know
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

And everytime they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'

Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing

Life Is Sweet,Natalie Merchant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nataliemerchant/lifeissweet.html,"It's a pity
It's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again? 
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside 

It's a pity
It's a downright crime
But it happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
Wanna hide from the vicious world outside 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

Your daddy he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied, 
And you know
That's not right 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 
It's high time that you decide
In your own mind 

Tried to comfort you
Tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind
They can't see 

Fortune gonna come some day
All gonna fade away
Your daddy the war machine and
Your mama the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she can not see 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 

It's high time you decide
It's time you make up your own sweet little mind 

They told you life is long
Be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more
You should be grateful 

But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know
It will be over 

Cause life is sweet
And life is also very short

Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine

All the words that we said
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen

For somebody's sake
Now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep,
It's all that we need
When we wake we would find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

It's foreign on this side,
And I'll not leave my home again.
There's no place to hide
And I'm nothing but scared.

You dream of colors that have never been made,
You imagine songs that have never been played.
They will try to buy you and your mind.
Only the curious have something to find.

It's foreign on this side,
And the truth is a bitter friend.
But reasons few have I to go back again.

Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day.
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain.
There's no path to follow, once you're here.
You'll climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs.

It's foreign on this side,
But it feels like I'm home again.

But I don't think I'm scared.

In a sky so clear and blue

In their day

Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way

Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again

Has turned to Sunday's rain

The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,Gil Scott-Heron,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gilscottheron/therevolutionwillnotbetelevised.html,"You will not be able to stay home, brother
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and
Skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
In 4 parts without commercial interruptions
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon
Blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John
Mitchell, General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by the
Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie
Wood and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia
The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs
The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner
Because the revolution will not be televised, Brother

There will be no pictures of you and Willie May
Pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run
Or trying to slide that color TV into a stolen ambulance
NBC will not be able to predict the winner at 8:32
On reports from 29 districts
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of Whitney Young being
Run out of Harlem on a rail with a brand new process
There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy
Wilkins strolling through Watts in a Red, Black and
Green liberation jumpsuit that he has been saving
For just the proper occasion

Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville
Junction will no longer be so damned relevant, and
Women will not care if Dick finally got down with
Jane on Search for Tomorrow because Black people
Will be in the street looking for a brighter day
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no highlights on the eleven o'clock
News and no pictures of hairy armed women
Liberationists and Jackie Onassis blowing her nose
The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb or
Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom
Jones, Johnny Cash, Engelbert Humperdinck, or The Rare Earth
The revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be right back
After a message about a white tornado, white lightning, or white people
You will not have to worry about a dove in your
Bedroom, a tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl
The revolution will not go better with Coke
The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised
Will not be televised, will not be televised
The revolution will be no re-run brothers
The revolution will be live",1971,happy

Don't Let It Bring You Down,Neil Young,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/dontletitbringyoudown.html,"Old man lying
By the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking
From the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky

Cold wind ripping
Down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying
By the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Blind man running
Through the light
Of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down
To the river of sight
And you can really understand

Red lights flashing
Through the window
In the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying
In a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around",1970,happy

And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)
And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away

And we can start again
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away

And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again

Red Right Hand,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/redrighthand.html,"Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul,
but there won't be a single thing
that you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car? 
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand",1994,happy

You cannot bear

So insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas
To wash down all this pride

Just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool
But you just run to hide
And I can't abide

Don't be so sensitive
We're not playing
A game anymore
You don't have
To be so defensive
Don't you plead me your case
Don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face
'Cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock
From under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave
And all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame

I got my feet
On the ground
And I don't go
To sleep to dream
You got your head
In the clouds and
You're not at all

She's got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the food of the ages

She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution

She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery bog
Throwing troubles to the dying embers

She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution

She's got a paradise camouflage
Like a whip-crack sending me shivers
She's the boat in a strip mine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers

She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution",1996,happy
Halfway Up the Hindu Kush,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/halfwayupthehindukush.html,"The first time that I saw you 
I said for goodness sake 
That man's got the power 
he's a charmer with a snake 
I was thrille and fascinated 
but somehow liberated, 
When you took me to a place I'd never been. 
You showed me lots of things I'd never seen 

You set me free 
as if you'd taken me, 
Halfway up the Hindu Kush 
And I love you, 
for showing me the view 
from halfway up the Hindu Kush 

The next time that I saw you, you looked into my eyes 
I was sitting on your carpet when I felt it begin to rise. 
I kinda got the feeling, 
I was floating to the ceiling, 
Instead of looking at the sky 
you picked me up and showed me how to fly. 

You set me free, as if you'd taken me, 
Halfway up the Hindu Kush 
And I love you 
for showing me the view, 
From halfway up the Hindu Kush 

From halfway up the Hindu, 
from halfway up the Hindu, 
From halfway up the Hindu Kush. 

You set me free, as if you'd taken me, 
Halfway up the Hindu Kush 
And I love you, 
for showing me the view, 
From halfway up the Hindu Kush.

Breaking It Up,Lykke Li,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lykkeli/breakingitup.html,"If you're going abroad I can't help you

If we're just waiting a second too long
Darling I'll leave and you won't come along

So give me the reason to stay
Give me the reason to wait
You know I don't look to get caught
'Cause darling we're here but my true love is not

Breaking it up, it's already gone
Breaking it up, I didn't mean to fraud
Breaking it up

If you're crossing the street I might be there

And I call you baby I will and I do
Persuade you in though I know that we're through
I let you think that I'm yours when I'm not
Keep you here though I'm ready to drop the last line

I'm breaking it up, before it's on
Breaking it up, it's already gone

Hurts to hold

Should release but just tighten my grip

I'll give it up to you

It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon

Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then),The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/yankeebayonetiwillbehomethen.html,"[Soldier:]
Heart-carved tree trunk, Yankee bayonet
A sweetheart left behind

[Girl:]
Far from the hills and the sea-swelled Carolinas
That's where my true love lies

[Soldier:]
Look for me when the sun-bright swallow
Sings upon the birch bough high

[Girl:]
But you are in the ground with the wolves and the weevils
All a-chew upon your bones so dry

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave?
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
Then

[Girl:]
When I was a girl how the hills of Oconee
Made a seam to hem me in

[Soldier:]
There at the fair when our eyes caught, careless
Got my heart right pierced by a pin

[Soldier:]
But O did you see all the dead of Manassas
All the bellies and the bones and the bile?

[Girl:]
No, I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with child

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then

[Soldier:]
Stems and bones and stone walls too
Could keep me from you
This skein of skin is all too few
To keep me from you

[Soldier and Girl:]
But O my love though our bodies may be parted
Though our skin may not touch skin
Look for me with the sun-bright sparrow
I will come on the breath of the wind",2006,happy

Size of the entire universe man
Usually kind to smaller man

Millenium hand and an eon hand
When they meet it's a happy land
Powerful man, universe man

Person man, person man
Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can

Does he feel totally worthless?

Go out and sit on the lawn

But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine

Mom and Dad you made me so uptight
I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight

Sendin' dirty vibes my way

Ah pollution fills my lungs 
And convolution fills my mind 
Ah my legs do ache 
I contemplate 
That living's less than fine 
My spine does tingle 
When I think of being 
Freed from this curse 
But what is worse I feel 
Life is a bubble 
Blown until it's burst 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
To get rid of this feeling 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
For some good soul healing

And reached into his bag

Got a record with a tag

With hip shaking and such things

Grabs a mic and starts to sing 
You need some 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
To make you high to make you high 
When heaven falling from the sky 
To make you high to make you high 

Doctor I am feeling better 
What was that you sang 
Did you write it or recite it 
Or just steal it from a band 
Ah my bones are feeling stronger 
And my spirit's feeling fresh 
Ah that dose of 145 has put the life 
Back in my breath 
'yes yes yes' the doctor said 
Then he sat me down and say 
'young man don't think I wrote 
These chords they're written in 
Your brain' 
And when you hear them 
There's a shakedown that begins within 
The mind 
Cos these three chords make people 
Feeling better all the time ah 
They keep repeating 
Like a scratch on a cd 
But it's quality cos these three harmonies 
Breed positivity 
Protecting against insanity 
Of modern insecurities 
Believe me when I tell you 
All you need is to be hearing all that 

One four five

To make you high to make you high 
When they said what and you said why 
To make you high to make you high

The Mariner's Revenge Song,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/themarinersrevengesong.html,"We are two mariners
Our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs are ceiling beams
Its guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you
And I will relay to you
How our histories interweave

At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease

As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind

Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried,
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat

But never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty

The following day
I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind
I could almost hear
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea:
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed.""

And then, that fateful night,
We had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath

The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale
(oh, oh)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive as well as me

It gives my heart great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(oh, oh)",2005,happy

Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia

Black Friday Rule,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/blackfridayrule.html,"I want to believe in myself once again 
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end 
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you 
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye 
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy 
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold 
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane 
Flew all the way to California 
This mess in my head is a mess getting out 
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry 
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine 
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed 
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still 
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill 
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe 
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

So I must remain in my new adopted land 
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can 
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name 
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken

With you I might start to feel
With you I will get there
With you I will live for real
I will breathe the air, I'll dance
And you will wonder why
It's because you made me see
This chance was moving by
Because I'm not going to live forever
But as long as I do
I'd love to live for real
With you I might get there
With you I might start to feel
With you I will get there
With you I will live for real
When a cloud becomes my head
Play your music loud instead
And we'll dance until
The both of us are dead",2000,happy
Silent Sea,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/silentsea.html,"I was happy in my harbour 
When you cut me loose 
Floating on an ocean 
And confused 
Winds are whipping waves up 
Like sky scrapers 
And the harder they hit me 
The less I seem to bruise 

Oh when I 
Find the controls 
I'll go where I like 
I'll know where I want to be 
But maybe for now 
I'll stay right here 
On a silent sea 
On a silent sea",2004,happy
Save Me,Jem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jem/saveme.html,"Save me save me save me wooh

I've gotta stop my mind
Working overtime
It's driving me insane
It will not let me live
Always so negative
It's become my enemy

Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh
Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh

Why would I think such things
Crazy thoughts have quick wings
Gaining momentum fast
One minute I am fine
The next I've lost my mind
To a fake fantasy

And none of these 
Thoughts are real
So why is it that I feel
So cut up and so bad
I need to take control
Coz my mind is on a roll
And it isn't listening to me

Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh
(thinking and thinking)
Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dumbest of them all
Insecurities keep growing
Wasted energies are flowing
Anger, pain and sadness beckon
Panic sets in in a second
Be aware it's just your mind
And you can stop it anytime

Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh

Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh

If it works I'll let you know

The Dumbing Down Of Love,Frou Frou,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/froufrou/thedumbingdownoflove.html,"Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love

Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without
Without love

No no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
Cause no-one's receiving
This tunnel vision
Is turning out all wrong

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love
Without love
Without love

Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

What will happen
Lover alone without love

True Affection,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/trueaffection.html,"I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Down to the bottom

I wanted a junction and often there was one
You'd surfaced face-first and we'd
Share thought bubbles and
I still believe in the phrases that we breathed
But I know the distance isn't fair to cross

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

Your depths made a pressure that
Punctured my works and all your fluids couldn't tolerate the
Force of my thirst
I love the place where we shared our tiny grace
But just because its real don't mean its gonna work

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

And true affection floats
True affection sinks
Like a stone
I never felt so close
I never felt so all alone

And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea

You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see

Why so serious

Just acting tough
Maybe you're just not bad enough

Is the very same one
You're dying to reveal

Admitting that you just can't go through it alone

Ghost of Corporate Future,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/ghostofcorporatefuture.html,"A man walks out of his apartment,
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings,
Trying to save his suit,
Trying to save his suit.
Trying to dry, and to dry, and to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform,
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""
Everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""

But he doesn't care,
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Ghost of Corporate Future
The ghost said, ""Take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet.""

He also said,
""Imagine you go away
On a business trip one day
And when you come back home,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan.""

""And people make you nervous
You'd think the world is ending,
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic,
And everyone's sarcastic,
And all your food is frozen,
It needs to be defrosted.""

""You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.""

""Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee,
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news,
Maybe you should kiss someone nice,
Or lick a rock,
Or both.""

""Maybe you should cut your own hair
'Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead""

""And people are just people,
They shouldn't make you nervous.
The world is everlasting,
It's coming and it's going.
If you don't toss your plastic,
The streets won't be so plastic.
And if you kiss somebody,
Then both of you'll get practice.""

""The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
And take off both your shoes.
'Cause people are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.
People are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.""

Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely

Salty Dog,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/saltydog.html,"I'll wait for you till I turn blue 
There's nothin' more a man can do 
Don't get your bollocks in a twist 
Settle down, don't take a fit 
Ya drank with demons straight form Hell 
They almost nearly won as well 
Ya wiped the floor with victory 
Then puked until you fell asleep

Blackened was the banshee's wail 
These boot will never fill her jail 
So you crawled into an empty boat 
For the Gulf of Mexico 
Till Cortez came an' when so did you 
From the ashes charred and blue 
Smellin' like a Salty Dog 
Back from Hell where you belong

Anarchy, the scourge of every sea 
The Antichrist aboard a rig 
With us your cutthroat thieves 
The ship went down we all near drowned 
Ya stood there on the deck 
Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse 
And dragged you from the wreck

They threw a rope around yer neck 
To watch you dance the jig of death 
Then left ya for the starvin' crows 
Hoverin' like hungry whores 
One flew down plucked out yer eye 
The other he had in his sights 
Ya snarled at him, said leave me be 
I need the bugger so I can see",2000,happy

Life on Mars?,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/lifeonmars.html,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say

Drifting into my solitude,

Walking In Memphis,Marc Cohn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marccohn/walkinginmemphis.html,"Put on my blue suede shoes and
I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
And she's down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian, child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight!""

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothers and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustling, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them

This is street radio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama
Standin in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people sake
The People

Pretty hairdos
And those lipstick kisses
Blown yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

Now take me down
Don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
Don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound

Stop Me,Mark Ronson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markronson/stopme.html,"[The Smiths cover]

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never ? I never !
Who said I'd lied because I never ?
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my knee
And broke my spleen
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied ? - because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied ? - because I never

Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...
...I drank more

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

Set free me why don't you
get out my life why don't you
Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on

Set me free why don't you girl
get out my life why don't you babe
Cause you don't really love me, no, no
You just keep my hanging on",2007,happy

Sacred parts, your get aways
You come along on summer days
Tenderly, tastefully

And so may, we make time
Try to find somebody else
This place is mine

You said today, you know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts little girl
I'm in love with something real
It could be me, that's changing!

And so may, we make time
To try and find somebody else
Who has a line

Now season with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long ending fast

And in the evening, when we are sleeping
We are sleeping. Oh, we are sleeping

Nibble on your ear

You leave me tangled in a knot (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

I see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Eyes forgot)

Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should sit down

Yeah, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down

Oh, well, we made love
Like a pair of black wizards
You freed me from the past
You fucked the suburbs out of me (The suburbs out of me)
And all those ugly days
That made us so sick (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
They are just fossils now
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)

You Can't Steal My Love,Mando Diao,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mandodiao/youcantstealmylove.html,"I was walking down the street 
with my chains chains chains 
tied up to my feet 
I leaned instead of jiggie 
with the sidewalk 
Now this street tells the same old boring tale 
that has failed in so many ways of life 
To trust its stories 
you've got to be dull as them 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah, yeah!!! 

I met her in a crowded room 
where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand 
I watched her beauty from an armchair 
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film 
with those kids in New York in the eighties 
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway"" 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch,

Congratulation Mr. Major 
you savior, 
betrayer, 
you stinking master of trusts 
How does it feel to ride all those horses 
You cannot touch our hearts 
when we're in bloom 
I assume that we'll win over the heads again 
We conceal non, 
you'll feel none, 
that's what I promise 

And all the love we've got in store, 
you can't kill You peasants! 
We won it all 
And the love I have for her 
you cannot touch, 
my golden hand, 
'Cause it's guarded by your filthy promises 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants

Half Asleep,School of Seven Bells,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/schoolofsevenbells/halfasleep.html,"Sometimes I go whole days
listening bored, half asleep
I won't say anything
that's worth a thing to me
One day, suddenly, time
took a turn that once felt so brief
I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly

What begins as an unguarded
train of thought slowly can become
an addiction to the slumber
of disconnection and the resonance
of memory that no longer has a shape
but keeps you numb through
the hours till gone is another day

Be aware, my darling
these things I say I mean
are just traces of something
I long to feel again
I see our time expand
in the air almost forcibly,
spreading thinner till it dissolves completely",2008,happy

Stuff me in your bones

You're still driving my car
Sticks and stones break my bones
But tears don't leave any scars
So I'm all alright
I'm all alright
I've been lonely before

Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends

I know that you want me I can
See it in your eyes
You might as well be honest 'cause the
Body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll
I'll tell you mine
I'm fellin' quite sexy
And I want you for tonight
If I move too fast just let me know
'Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement
And I like a man that goes

If you want me
Let me know it
I'll make time but
You've got to show it
If you need me
I want to see

I don't want you down on your knees

I need someone who understands
I'm a woman a real woman
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

Runaway,Janet Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janetjackson/runaway.html,"I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh under the moon glow down in Mexico I dreamed
One thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll sail the waters of many colours
We won't need a compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, as long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I wanna share the world with you, you see
Spring time in Paris feels so good to me
Oh this is for me reality
So please make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

But when you break me into nothing
Don't you know

Over and over again
Stupid fights
Wrong or right
Goodbye...

I Remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again
With nothing left inside
No I don't wanna but I gotta let you go

You're the one mistake
I really didn't mind
So beautiful, unmerciful
It took me down
Too little and too late
So now I know your kind
You fake it easy, just to please me
Don't you know

It's not like we haven't tried
Over and over again
Sleepless nights wrong or right

Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn

Holding onto things that vanished 
Into the air 
Left me in pieces 
But now I√¢¬Ä¬ôm rising from the ashes 
Finding my wings 
And all that I needed 
Was there all along 
Within my reach 
As close as the beat of my heart

Apples In The Trees,Mirah,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mirah/applesinthetrees.html,"There should be no hesitation

What a way to compromise 
It's a long long way 
Before you get to claim that final prize 

Looking at that sorry face 
I can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night 
The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me, 
There's food for you 
There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide 
And there is love beyond compare 

There's apple in the trees

There's no escape so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through

Crying Shame,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/cryingshame.html,"It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?

How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning under the same sun?
By now we say it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really wanna play?

We could close our eyes, it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we gonna blame now?

And, oh, it's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home

I can close my eyes, it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I can close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all

It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out

But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me (we`ve got a good life).

What can I compare you to, a window the sun shines through? 
Maybe the silver moon, a smile rising
The magic of the fading day, satellites on parade
A toast to the plans we've made to live like kings.

I lose my breath despite the air
When the rain falls down I give in to despair
Pink magnolia in winter she doesn't care 
if you don't show up to have another cup.

What can I compare you to, when everything looks like you?

Flowers that bloom your eyes, hummingbirds side by side

Who love you now and loved you then 
And some were sweet and some were cold and snuffed you 
And some just layed around in bed 
And some, they crumbled you straight to your knees 
Did it cruel, did it tenderly 
Some they crawled their way into your heart 
To rend your ventricles apart

The perfume that the air would bring

Where the barkers call the moon down

There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world
But the angles and the corners
Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And here in Spain I am a Spaniard
I will be buried with my marionettes
Countess and courtesan
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
While you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seat belts on
We live this close to death

When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoats
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach

With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle
And she's laid in bed on the upper deck

And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Til at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions, and their opinions

And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her thirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed, and this is how you're fed

So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep",2002,happy

Missing my gay Paree
In this desert dry

And I wrote my girl
Told her I would not return
I've terribly taken a turn
For the worse now, I fear

It's been a year or more
Since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war
So far away from my home

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine

La la la low

Medicating in the sun
Pinch doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage!
A bottle of ancient Chiraz!
The smattering of distant applause
Is ringing in my poor ears

On the old left bank
My baby in a charabanc
Riding up the width and length
Of the Champs Elysee

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards

Fish heads running from rain
You know i'll do anything you want me to
Lamp oil lovers may say
""freedom hangs like heaven over everyone""
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But his papa's going to hide shaking gristle
And shaking like bone

Mary, carry my name
Hoof marks hacked up all i had to offer you
Looked all over this place
Lost your portrait lately when the winter blew
In like herod and them
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But a dollar says he'll lick that devil
And do it alone",P:  ,happy
Amsterdam,Peter Bjorn and John,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peterbjornandjohn/amsterdam.html,"Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow

Baby went to Amsterdam
4-5 days by the big canal
Now it's so slow, so slow

And I was heading up north to a place that I know
Eating well, sleeping well
But still I was way, way out of line
Amsterdam was stuck in my mind

Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone

Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow

Baby went to Amsterdam
4-5 days by the big canal
Now it's so slow, so slow

And I tried to go away to a place of my own
Working hard, fill my time
But from early on till I hit the bed
Amsterdam was stuck in my head

Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone

Baby went to Amsterdam

Within a Mile of Home,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/withinamileofhome.html,"Dust falls on the empty halls of my old school
Where the memories fade like the casualty, a forgotten fool
Now the wide-eyed has become the blind of spoken rule
As equal only deep is now the word
The lesson's not the answer you once heard

""Don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down""
She said, ""I picked you up each time before you hit the ground
Your selfish face is now erased when someone mentions you
And the darkness that you left is overstepped aside
With disappearing clouds, the sun arrives
Within a mile of home, within a mile of home""

Oh worry, oh my worry has it been that long?
The whistle keeps on blowing but the chills all gone
His empty frame cannot explain, there's nothing left inside
So sing to me a song from yesterday
When laughter filled the tears that we now make

""Don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down""
She said, ""I picked you up each time before you hit the ground
Your selfish face is now erased when someone mentions you
If only you had seen what I now see
And turned the corner where you would of been
Within a mile of home, within a mile of home""

So sing to me, sing me a song, a song from yesterday
And when the laughter turned these tears before the promises, then they'll slip away
Don't turn your back on me, don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down
Don't turn your back on me, don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down
We are within a mile, we are within a mile, within a mile of home
We are within a mile, we are within a mile, within a mile of home

Your clever eyes could easily disguise 
Some backwards purpose 
It's enough to make me nervous. 
Do you harbor sighs, or spit in my eye 

But your lips when we speak 
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire. 
So let me walk these coals till you believe 
I can cut the mustard well enough 
Cause you know as soon as breathe we scrutinize 

Unknown quotients, you must be using potions 
How else could you tie my head to the sky 
This new convection has left me wondering why 
I can't concern myself with ordinary tripe. 

Like what's this morning's paper got to say 
And which brand of coffee to make 
This is no umbrella to take into the wind 
And before we begin is there nothing to kill this anxiety. 

But your lips when we speak 
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire.

Where is the wind
Why does it feel still again

What i get slow is how to bounce back
You'll have to invent what you lack

Now I turn to the seasons, the sleeping demons
I want your attention, your infection
For every new reason, do you know how i need it?

Oh your face and everything that you say
And Oh your face and everything that you say
And Oh your face and everything that you say

The call came like a wave of relief
I'm such a lucky mess

The Good Thing,Talking Heads,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/talkingheads/thegoodthing.html,"I will fight; will fight with my heart.
I will fight; will fight with understanding.
In my mind, the weather never changes
Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A straight line exists between me and the good things.
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.
So I say:
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.",1978,happy

Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I have drank my beers
And watched my fears
Fly away

And until this day
She still swings my way

Sometimes she says she loves me not

To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today

Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers, and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves

The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails

i got buried rumors waiting in the woods,

and call me over,
skies they rape and skies are sober.
minds they fake and minds rolled over

i know that it's true
i know theres seven thousand things you rather be and rather do,
and i know that you fuck what you love
and you love what you fuck.

i'll keep them out girl, i'll keep it true
i'll do anything inside the skin of you
cause i know that the sound of your heart
is a god i can trust,
like a man,
not a boy
i don't love i just fight with the violence in ourselves
its all gonna break

their is no lie to save your life
keep it coming

you'll never be as weird as Uncle Alice

And if you want me to

When you threw me out of bed
Well are you sure there's a heaven
For I'd rather be
A bad, bad...

To you there's a light ahead
I keep on talking to myself

There's no beaten cause surrounding me now
There's no bleeding heart
And I don't know you right now...

For all we contained was once just written of
And all of the dances are rituals of which you were
And who's dancing now

Dropped out of school

Warm just like the winter

Staring at my shoes thinking of something to say
But nothing's better than what silence is saying
Every time I turn around
she's always looking away
It's just the nature of the game that we're playing

And I think I'm tapping out
I think I'm gonna skip the title bout

One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
It's only life after all

Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety 'til I sank it
I'm crawling on your shores

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

I stopped by the bar at 3 A.M
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain

We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain

We go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, we stand up for the lookout

I take him by the collars look him in the eye

I'm stupidly happy
This world's making sense

I'm stupidly happy
I roll like a train
I'm stupidly happy

All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar
I'm a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are

I'm stupidly happy
Like the words to that song
I'm stupidly happy

And should the Devil walk up with his business card out

Drowning in my id

Of the chains that pull the cars up 
The roller coaster mountain top so high
When it comes down it shoots back up
Straight back to the sky
I gotta laugh and then i'm asleep 
And then i walk around and wanna cry
Out at night to do the strand
The little candles make the bottles glow
Got ink all over my right hand
Getting crushes with no chance to grow
It's like i'll never ever land
There's always too much sun 
Or too much snow
I get slow days and no days
I get rusty and it's hard
But i get notions that oceans 
Are coming to my call
You can learn to get along

Stuck with the heart of an old punk
Drowning in my id
Always hungry like it's on junk

In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set

Next thing you know you are asleep in someone's lap
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

Quit so our thoughts could rest
Rest them, I'll never move?

But now you're here
Brighten my northern sky

I've been a long time that I'm waiting
Been a long time that I'm blown
I've been a long time that I've wandered
Through the people I have known
Oh, if you would and you could
Straighten my new mind's eye

Would you love me for my money
Would you love me for my head
Would you love me through the winter
Would you love me √¢¬Ä¬òtil I'm dead
Oh, if you would and you could
Come blow your horn on high

I never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here

Brighten my northern sky",1970,happy
Suffer For Fashion,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/sufferforfashion.html,"We just want to emote until we're dead

Pretty sirens don't go flat

Not like that
Not like that

When our tellies are six hours away
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever

Losing My Edge,LCD Soundsystem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lcdsoundsystem/losingmyedge.html,"Yeah, I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
The kids are coming up from behind.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London.
But I was there.

I was there in 1968. 
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks.
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978.
I'm losing my edge.

To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin.
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties.

But I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge, but I was there.
I was there.
But I was there.

I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks.
But I was there.
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City.
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience.
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band.
I told him, ""Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime.""
I was there.
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids.
I played it at CBGB's.
Everybody thought I was crazy.
We all know.
I was there.
I was there.
I've never been wrong.

I used to work in the record store. 
I had everything before anyone.
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan.
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes.
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988.

But I'm losing my edge to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent.
And they're actually really, really nice.

I'm losing my edge.

I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody.
Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits.
All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import.
I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87.
I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.

I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record.

I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables.

Said I tried to but I can't hold back what's deep in my soul

I'll find the courage and I'll find the grace

Summertime Clothes,Animal Collective,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animalcollective/summertimeclothes.html,"(Summer...)

Sweet summer night and I'm stripped to my sheets
Forehead is leaking, my AC squeaks
And a voice from the clock says, ""You're not gonna get tired""
My bed is a pool and the walls are on fire
Soak my head in the sink for a while
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you, we're going.

(I'm not sure where...
I'm not sure where, but I have seen you today)

It doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze, get a midnight meal
I point in the windows, you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard, smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go when our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yarn you'll be sleeping soon
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down, we'll go out again.

Don't cool off, I like your warmth.

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it whets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls, says that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you

Just you, just you, just you.",2009,happy

poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning,
as you hear the bodies burning.
No more war pigs of the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.

Moves away so fast
Fall down to the ground

There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times 
He runs washing his face in his hands

Oh how I meant no harm 
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him

Body of water
Toxic and timeless

That wipes the slate clean

No don't get lied to
Love was always cruel

And don't act strange
Don't be a stranger

Well if I could tame
All of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The winds indecision 
The sorrowful rain

Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind

And now I'm riding
All over this island
Looking for something 
To open my eyes

But I still sing glory from my high rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time, when we'll be set free

So don't stay mad
Just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new

And if I don't come back
I mean if I get side tracked

And got no place else you've found
There's only one thing left to do

In the desert, floored

I could never steal your gold away.

Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail

there's a flaming red horizon that screams our names 
And as your fantasies are broken in two 
Did you really think this bloody road 
would pave the way for you? 
You better turn around 
and blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel 

Racist everyman, what have you done? 
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son... 
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun 
All I want to do is love everyone...

would pave the way for you? 
You better turn around 
and blow your kiss hello to life eternal

There's no time for hatred, only questions 
Where is love, where is happiness, what is Life, 
where is peace? 

When will I find the strength to bring me release? 
And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said? 
Man, It sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead 
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell

In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)

Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)

For I am the parasite of this town

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two

I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him

With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar

I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Yeah we stare at the beautiful women

When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/dayisdone.html,"When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.",1969,happy

Won't be long till the truth comes out 
First impressions never last 
Lover's bonds they hold so fast

The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 

Welcome swallows dip and swing 
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
Rolling fog into my room 
Why did you give up on me so soon? 
So soon

Never heard the warning bell

Beautiful World,Colin Hay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/colinhay/beautifulworld.html,"My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like swimming in the sea
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free (or a woman if you are one)
I like swimming in the sea

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like drinking Irish tea
With a little bit of Lapsang Souchong
I like making my own tea

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like driving in my car
Roll the top down, sometimes I travel quite far
Drive to the ocean and stare up at the stars
I like driving in my car

All around is anger
Automatic guns
Death in large numbers
And no respect for women or our little ones
I tried talking to Jesus
But he just put me on hold
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And he could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
When you've given up the drink
And those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early, at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up, I watch it as it sets
Yeah, this is as good as it gets

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like sleeping with Marie
She is one sexy girl full of mystery
She says she doesn't love me
But she likes my company
For now that's good enough for me

I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free (or a woman if you are one)

I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair),Sandi Thom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandithom/iwishiwasapunkrockerwithflowersinmyhair.html,"Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar,
Not everybody drove a car,
When music really mattered and when radio was king,
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop-stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
My mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs,
And playing games meant kick-arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Look beautiful to me
Was sweeter than a kiss
I wish you all could see
I'm a long long way from home

By all of the petty things that I couldn't do

I wanna get out but there's no in-between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that I've sunken so low

If I wanna be free
I gotta stop playin' round and runnin' from me

And nothing ever lasts that hesitates

The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Back from holiday in my head
The ocean calling
Magic in the grave at the end
The old way falling

Something calling asking to create
The only other lasting love to make

Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Cause there's something within
There is something within, I'm awake
All my friends
There's something between
Because something within, I'm awake
You're all my friends
Alone, enough, awake [repeat]

We've got a feeling of the day
Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way
Love is our only true escape
Fearing nothing washed away the weight away the weight

Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way",2012,happy

Positively 4th Street,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/positively4thstreet.html,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down you just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on the side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you? Good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand it's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is to see you",,happy
Three Hours,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/threehours.html,"Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep 
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slave

Three hours from London
Jacomo's free
Taking his woes 
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known

Three hours from speaking
Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder
And three hours to fall

Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep 
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search for a master
In search for a slave",1969,happy
Fruit Tree,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/fruittree.html,"Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish 
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
Till time has flown 
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show

Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
Till you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why
Safe in a womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light

Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know 
What you are really worth

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while 
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
Till time has flown far from their dying day

Fruit tree
Fruit tree
No one knows you but the rain and the air
Don't you worry
They'll stand and stare when you're gone

Fruit tree

Open your eyes to another year
They will know that you were here
when you are gone",1969,happy

When the glitter's gone

The frost in a broken tree.

Many many years ago.

I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies.

Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never.

I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more

Stepping outside she is free

Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin',
kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen.
Dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh.

Settle down far from town, get me a pirogue

Swap my mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o.

Philosophy,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/philosophy.html,"Won't you look up at the skyline
At the mortar, block, and glass
And check out the reflections in my eyes
See they always used to be there
Even when this was all was grass
And I sang and danced about a high-rise

And you were laughing at my helmet hat
Laughing at my torch

Go ahead and laugh all you want
I got my philosophy
And I trust it like the ground
That's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down

I see that there is evil
And I know that there is good
And the in-betweens I never understood
Would you look at me I'm crazy
But I get the job done
I'm crazy but I get the job done

So go ahead and laugh all you want
I got my philosophy
And I trust it like the ground
That's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down

I pushed you cause I loved you guys
I didn't realize
That you weren't having fun
And I dragged you up the stairs
And I told you to fly
You were flapping your arms
Then you started to cry, you were too high

Now you take this all for granted
You take the mortar, block, and glass
And you forget the speech that moved the stone
And it's really not that you can't see
The forest from the trees
You just never been out in the woods alone

So you can laugh all you want to
But I've got my philosophy
And I love you you're my friend
But you got no philosophy
Now it's time for this song to end",1995,happy

Best Imitation of Myself,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/bestimitationofmyself.html,"I feel like a quote out of context
Withholding the rest
So I can be free what you want to see
I got the gesture and sound
Got the timing down
It's uncanny, yeah, you think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent
Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck
I do the best imitation of myself

The ""problem with you"" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me

We leaned in slowly

I pulled away
cuz you see I didn't think it would be
right I said let's save this
for some other night
She said ""No, no, no I know
That everything is gonna be just fine""
How could I do this when I want her to be all mine.

Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl

Will it mean much to you

Would you do it some more
Or will you stop once and wonder
What you're doing it for.
Hey slow Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.

Slow, slow jane, fly on by.",1970,happy

Should you go home?

Don't keep my loving on my mind.

Because it's messy, yes, this mess is mine
Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine

Look we've had similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns

May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.

Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Lights and Sounds,Yellowcard,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yellowcard/lightsandsounds.html,"Hello, you, how was the rest?
You made it through, but nevertheless
I got you out on a wire.
You be love and I√¢¬Ä¬ôll be a liar.

Tell it all and fill up the air,
But make it loud cause nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there
And nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there
And nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there

[Chorus:]
Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds.
Let them bring you in.
Slow burn, let it all fade out,
Pull the curtain down.
I wonder where you√¢¬Ä¬ôve been?

Make it new, but stay in the lines.
Just let go, but keep it inside.
Smile big for everyone,
Even when you know what they√¢¬Ä¬ôve done.
They gave you the end but not where to start;
Not how to build, how to tear it apart.

So tell it all and fill up the air,
But make it loud 'cause nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there
And nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there
And nobody√¢¬Ä¬ôs there

If I Fell,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/ififell.html,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you

When she learns we are two

Disintegration,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/disintegration.html,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is",1989,happy

wondering, will you call
and now i'm feeling high
soon i'll be feeling left for dead
sometimes someone saying yes
changes what you'll bet

and all i wanted
was just to hold you close
a little sunshine
just to butter my toast

i had to let you know
that we were meant to be just right
heaven sent, not sympathized
by everybody's lie

now i'm feeling left so dead
kicking up the dust in bed
wondering, i guess

In Time,Zero 7,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/zero7/intime.html,"All the words are calling
Got time on my own
There's no destination

Take some time
Just hang around awhile

Falling down on me
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say
That's gonna change the way I feel

And you're running with your life
Won't you come inside

Tearin' me apart

They're much brighter than anyone.
Oh the girls in the Queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung.

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
through the Barrowland history
and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care it's
it's only me and you.
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
it's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you.
That people they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care
tonight, it's only me and you.

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band starts to play.
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

And when the night turns to day
And the lights they fade away
I wish that life and love would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear.

I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age.

I Don't Wanna Grow Up,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/idontwannagrowup.html,"When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up

Seems like folks turn into things
that they'd never want
The only thing to live for
Is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up


Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up",1992,happy

Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Watching the fire as we grow old
Old dirt road
Rambling rose
Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold",,happy

And we're walking, she'll lead
If she's waiting, we'll leave.
I'm so gracious.

If you touch it
It's cold.
If you drop it
It breaks.
If you hold it
It shakes.
Boom! she said.

My name's I dare.

Fire of Heaven/Altar of Earth,Matisyahu,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/fireofheavenaltarofearth.html,"[verse 1]
Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man-made
Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames
Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up
In your own domain
Fire crackers ohh and aah
But they never maintain

[bridge]
Fires burning
Flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides on an alter made from the ground

[chorus]
Fire descends on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on to Mount Zion
[repeat 2x]

[verse 2]
One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries but the other one sings
You walk around like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got, thank God for all that life brings
The poor man has it all but not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty but he's sitting like a king

[bridge]

[verse 3]
Backpack's getting heavy, moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders and lead around your waist
Making way, run in haste
There is no time to taste what you ate
WE should be grateful got a plateful
Fire burns like ice morsels falling fire like rain

D.J.S,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/djs.html,"All of the d.j.s surely have taken a lesson
Start talkin trash and we'll come with my smith & wesson
A little competition comes my way but it always winds up the same,
""the stone that the builder refuse shall be the head cornerstone""

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
All of the d.j.s surely have taken a lesson
Try talkin trash and we'll come with a smith & wesson

Enough d.j.s come with enough style
but when I bus my lyrics we all Know it's wicked-wily.
Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night

You better strap with the gat
If you wanna walk with me, bound to come down
With the new stylee, rockin rubadub know as reggae music
Gotta come down with some new lyrics
It just ain't nothing, it's been a real long time

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
Rubadub blender a new mixer
I am the one with d.j. with enough flavor
Hear the dub and say lord have his grilled cheese.
I ain't Jamaican, but I ain't no freak
Caught the man eno with the one pound bag o' tweak
And called him ghost rider everytime you see him he fulfill the danger

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
Dred gotta a job to do and he might fulfill his mission
To see his pain would be his greatest ambition
We will survive in this world of competition
To make sure that till the ..is done

I won't wait so long
For you
Stop your messin around,
Better think of your future
Time to straighten right out or you'll wind up in jail",1992,happy

Painted where all the clouds were wrong, 
With killer stares and sideways frowns, 
In keeping with, the universe all upside down. Twice, twice, twice.
And broken legs and arms in slings, 
You cry secretly. You won't wear my diamond rings. Why? Why? Why? 

A billion cares, a thousand stings we lie frequently, 
Choose the chapter where they start fights, fights, fights.
And millionaires have bought this town and changed everything.

Heard codes in the melodies
You heeded the call
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use em all

Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest you could just accrue it all

You'll be okay, anyway

Something about insurance policies

Ten stars on sticks and placed them in my small metal
Bucket and I gave the other half of the moon to you

Just as long as you're around 
And here I'll be dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down 
To each other we'll be facing 
By love we'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know 
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside 
My friend 
With each moment the more I love you 
Crush me 
Come on 
So much you have given love 
That I would give you back again and again 
Meaning I'll hold you 
And please let me always",1998,happy
Image Of The Invisible,Thrice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thrice/imageoftheinvisible.html,"We're more than carbon and chemicals

Free will is ours and we can't let go

We can't allow this, the quiet cull
We are the image of the invisible

We are the image of the invisible

We all were lost now we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are the named and we are known
We know that we'll never walk alone

We're more than static and dial tone
We are the image of the invisible
We're emblematic of the unknown
We are the image of the invisible
So raise the banner, bend back your bows
We are the image of the invisible
Remove the cancer, take back your souls

The shadow overtake us, we are known

The Mixed Tape,Jack's Mannequin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacksmannequin/themixedtape.html,"This is morning
That's when I spend the most time
Thinking 'bout what I've given up
This is a warning
When you start the day just to close the curtains
You're thinking 'bout what I've given up

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I rearrange the songs again
This mix could burn a hole in anyone
But it was you I was thinking of

I read your letter
The one you left when you broke into my house
Retracing every step you made
And you said you meant it
And there's a piece of me in every single
Second of every single day
But if it's true then tell me how it got this way

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I rearrange the songs again
This mix could burn a hole in anyone
But it was you I was thinking of

And I can't get to you
I can't get to you
I can't get to you (you, you)

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I conduct a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I'm cutting through you track by track
I swear to God this mix could sink the sun
But it was you I was thinking of

And where are you now?
And where are you now?

And this is my mixed tape for her
It's like I wrote every note
With my own fingers",2005,happy

I rock the cow girl blues

How could you watch innocence forgone
Does what we've done ever really belong?

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

Now, my mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a drunken man needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Lord, is when he's on the drunk

Somebody go get my baby sister
Tell her to do, not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Well, I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Yes, I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, the rising sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl

We've been had I know it's over

See me age 19 with some dumb haircut from 
1960 moving to New York City 
live with my friends there we're all taking the same steps

How could she pull it, if she's dead?

I've been this way a long while
I'd surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It's been a wild ride
I wouldn't change a minute
I can't slow down inside
Guess that's why I live it

The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth's hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown

I'm not used to it, you'd think I'd be by now
The ins the outs the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you we're gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You're lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display

It's something one won't understand
Unless they're in it with me hand and hand

Don't buy the fear don't buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn
Even if you're coming down

Sometimes it's wearable sometimes is bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is full

I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire

Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off

Which is times'd by the daggers and the root of all our fights,
The pass of your poem just to swathe me in your knowing

Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I am a dash and you are a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote

I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over-analysed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am ""Needing of your love""

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters

The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest

May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

You Give Me Something,James Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmorrison/yougivemesomething.html,"You only stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water

For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing 
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
Because someday I might know my heart

You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what they mean

I never thought that I'd love someone
That was someone else's dream

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing 
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
Because someday I might call you from my heart

But it might be a second too late
And the words that I could never say

Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door.

There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels.
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens.

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?
Doo, doo doo.
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician.

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/lucyintheskywithdiamonds.html,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile

But homework he can wait
I never start my homework till its already too late
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
But it's hard
When there's a basketball game in the park
It's 1998 
And everybody's saying:
""Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some day√Ç¬Ö""

It's Monday bloody Monday
And there's two things I forgot
I forgot to do my homework
And I've only got one sock
I'm halfway through a test
But I just can't concentrate
I'm sitting next to Fontaine
I want to ask her on a date
I really want to start a conversation
But each time she walks past
I start choking on my pencil
And fall flat on my ass
I need to concentrate
I have to get this grade
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday

But just right now
Can' think of anything better to do
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune

Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax

I'll buy an old car
Someday√Ç¬Ö

Imagine all the things I could do.

Bring it forward to the present day now
Cause some things have changed
but some things never change)

Who used to be in my class
I always gave him wedgies cause I thought he worked too hard
He said, ""Harry, life is great""
I feel so happy these days
I'm a litigation lawyer
So I got it made
I'm going out with Fontaine 
Rememer her from tenth grade?
I drive a Porsche so I can't complain√Ç¬Ö

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight)

You're the Only One,Maria Mena,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariamena/youretheonlyone.html,"Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

And I probably forgot to tell you this
Like that time when I forgot to tell you about the scar
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?
See you're not what I expected
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

I hope you can forgive me for that time
When I put my hand between your legs
And said it was small
Cuz its really not at all
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down
Just to keep you around
Cuz the day that you realize how amazing you are 
You're gonna leave me

You're the only one who
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

Exactly what I mean

Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground",2004,happy
Superman,Goldfinger,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfinger/superman.html,"So here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am
pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to keep
the ground on my feet
it seems the world's
falling down around me

The nights are all long
I'm singing this song
to try and make the answers
more than maybe

And I'm so confused
about what to do
sometimes I want 
to throw it all away

So here I am
growing older all the time
looking older all the time
feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am
pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to sleep
I lost count of the sheep
my mind is racing faster 
every minute

What could I do more
yeah I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles
but I can't quit

And I'm so confused
about what to do
sometimes I want 
to throw it all away

Controlling everything in site
I'm feeling weak
I don't feel right
you're telling me 
I have to change
telling me to act my age
but if all that I can do
is just sit and watch time go
then I'll have to say good-bye
life's too short to watch it fly
to watch it fly

So here I am
growing older all the time
looking older all the time
feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kidrock/allsummerlong.html,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no Internet
But, man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Sweet Home Alabama
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon ohhhh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me

[Chorus:]
Oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your...
Strength

Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a feigning to a slip
And a kickin' from the hip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie Chin and little Sammy Chong
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
We took the bow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing

Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ha

Sure enough

Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
Make sure you have expert timing

Parentheses,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/parentheses.html,"Some philosophies fuel the belief in the self
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
Built well, you're a strong letter ""I""
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
Now and then you can bend
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
You fear that you can't do it all
And you're right
Even day takes relief every day
from its work making light from the night

And when you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms

When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase

If something in the deli aisle makes you cry

Scar,Missy Higgins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/missyhiggins/scar.html,"He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said ""use these down to your bones""
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought ""this one knows better than I do""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, she smelled like sugar and
Spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one, looked at my insides clicking
Her tongue and said
""This will all have to come undone""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Did he ask if I would come along
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy
Just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky",2002,happy
Escapade,Janet Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janetjackson/escapade.html,"As I was walkin by
Saw you standin there
With a smile
Lookin' shy
You caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang
For a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check
I'm ready to go
I promise you
I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Es-ca-pade
We'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade
Leave your worries behind
Es-ca-pade
You can be mine
Es-ca-pade
An escapade

So don't hold back
Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Worked so hard all week

Set Yourself on Fire,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/setyourselfonfire.html,"In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing [x6]
There is only one... thing

20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever...",2004,happy

Of better nights and better days
Hiding in a refuge
Of memories I've made

For the all time high

To put your troubles aside
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
Throw it away
Gotta throw it away
All the colorful days my friend
Are coming around again

I got someone waiting for me
It's been so long since we met
And I may not be your salvation but I'll offer nonetheless
And if like me u wanna take that chance
It's coming around again

No more riding on my love
Feel the weight is off my shoulders
As my feet become unstuck

Make it look whiter than it seems 
Paint me over with your dreams 
Shove away my ethnicity 
Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
And say just what is on my mind 
Without offending your might 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today 
Weatherworn, looking all the rage 
They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster 
Now it√¢¬Ä¬ôs moccasins we sport 
We take the culture and contort 
Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you

And your toes creepin' around

Hand me down my pants and get me off this street

I'm passed out in your garden,
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body,
I'd come into your party but I'm soft

Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes,
And in your nose blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes,
You let you perfect nipple show",2005,happy

Do You Believe In Magic?,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

I wanna try to be the person you want the person you need
It's hard to conceive that somebody like you could be with someone like me

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
Ooh-ooh

You're lookin' so fresh, it's catchin' my eye
Why oh why did I not see this before
The girl I adore was right in front of me
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
And ask why it took so long to see we're meant to be

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
On the good, the bad, the ugly
The smiles, the laughs, the funny
Oh, the things we put each other through
It's for you, for you, for you

You make me happy, whether you know it or not
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
I am so happy
Knowin' you are the one that I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce

Fumble,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/fumble.html,"Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
I set her straight, it's not based on your life. 

There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight. 

No need to be uncalm, 
We'll leave it by the phone, 
A message you can swallow, 
A letter to sign, 
No need to be alarmed, 
We'll leave this all alone, 
And all the guilt will follow you in a line.

We'll have butterflies soon,

You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you

I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
But I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while

You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the inside
There's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I'm got to search out for your clues

I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift that I stole from
just wanting to live
Now I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise

Trying to outrun your fear
Your running to lose, heart on your sleeve
And your soul in your shoes
Take a left, a sharp left
And another left, meet me on the corner
And we'll start again",2000,happy

Common People,Pulp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pulp/commonpeople.html,"She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College,
That's where I
Caught her eye. 

She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, ""In that case I'll have a rum and coca-cola.""
She said, ""Fine,""
And in thirty seconds time
She said,

""I want to live like common people.
I want to do whatever common people do,
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you.""

Well, what else could I do? 
I said, ""I'll see what I can do.""

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it
Somewhere,
So it started there. 

I said, ""Pretend you've got no money,""
She just laughed and said, ""Oh, you're so funny.""
I said, ""Yeah?
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here."" 

Are you sure you want to live like common people?
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people, 
You want to sleep with common people like me. 

But she didn't understand,
She just smiled and held my hand. 

Rent a flat above a shop,
Cut your hair and get a job. 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school. 

But still you'll never get it right 
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching 'roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all. 

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
And dance and drink and screw 
Because there's nothing else to do. 

Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do. 
Because you think that poor is cool. 

I want to live with common people like you,
I want to live with common people like you [etc..]",1995,happy

Her heels so high, and my hopes so low

And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
How we'll be in love by the morning

I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier.

Has broken up into bits in my moat

Walk the cramps off
Go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin
Hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade
Far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And the whole mess of roads we're now on

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is

I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks

And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up...I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
Until I believed I was the crazy one, 
and in a way
I guess I was...

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading a sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

If you wrote me off I'd understand it
Because I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up...
I've landed

And you will be so
happy to know
I've come alone,
it's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's by my goodbye I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's OK to call
Now I'll answer for myself

Come pick me up,
...I've landed",2005,happy
Sleep All Day,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/sleepallday.html,"His after moan though cries oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here And time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons, oh, time to end the pain
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
Why don't we?

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us
and we knew it was time to take a chance here
and time to compromise our lives just a little while
and it was time for all the wrong reasons
but time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun
to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines
then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
and they knew it was time, time to take a chance here
time to compromise our little lives just a little while
and they knew it was time for all the wrong and, lonely, lonesome reasons, oh
as time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands

The Fear,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/thefear.html,"I want to be rich and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
I heard people die while they are trying to find them

And I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous.

[Pre-chorus:]
I'll look at the sun and I'll look in the mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm on to a winner.

[Chorus:]
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic

And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault it's how I'm programmed to function

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner
Now everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner

Heartbreak, cigarettes and songs, with a winters chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter, and a run away

Eight hours for what

That times are holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes

Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose

Sad to think that she don't see what I see

I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

Sends you flyin', cryin'

Dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie
On the corner of the street

And the people, passin' by
Stare in wild wonder
And the inside juke-box
Roars out just like thunder

And ev'rything looks so complete
When you walk out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79

Wasted days you've come to pass

So go I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor

Coronation rickshaw grab

So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass

Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass",2008,happy

The chaos that controlled my mind

Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind

Well, you started off with nothing

Slap you on the back and say, ""Please, please""

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?

Now you only get it in your night dress

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag

Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me",2003,happy

Head in the ground

Emerges from the mist we'll sound

Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo

Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

Going to the candidates' debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at it you lose

A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, wo wo wo

'Joltin Joe' has left and gone away, hey hey hey

Songbird,Oasis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/songbird.html,"Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone",2002,happy

So hard to leave you all alone

See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

We sink to be sunk, but life is no race
When I'm not happy I'm in disgrace
So I spend time with guessing on you
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart

Firework,Katy Perry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/firework.html,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through, -ough, -ough

Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed

It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You told us of your new life there
You got someone comin' around
Gluing tinsel to your crown
He's got you talking pretty loud
You berate remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
You say you're still in love
If it's true what can be done
It's hard to leave all those moments behind

Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed

Everythings Just Wonderful,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/everythingsjustwonderful.html,"Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental,
It seems to me that it's spiraling outta control and it's inevitable,

This time is yours, this time is mine,
It's temperamental,
It seems to me, we're on all fours,
Crawling on our knees,
Someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ almighty,
Do I feel alright? No not slightly,
I wanna get a flat I know I can't afford it,
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage,
Well it's very funny cos I got your fucking money,
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble,
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

Oh yes, I'm fine,
Everything's just wonderful,
I'm having the time of my life.

Don't you want something else,
Something new, than what we've got here,
And don't you feel it's all the same,
Some sick game and it's not insincere,
I wish I could change the ways of the world,
Make it a nice place
Until that day, I guess we stay,
Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw

Why can't I sleep at night,
Don't say it's gonna be alright,
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognaise,
and not feel bad about it for days and days and days.
In the magazines they talk about weight loss,
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss,
Oh no it's not the life I chose,
But I guess that's the way that things go,

As licky as trips

Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say I'll keep on holding you in
My arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah as smitten as that
I can't get that small
The way you fur
The how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make-believe
It makes me pull my hair all out

And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
For two drunk kids trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
But eventually the sky did return and I was there outside in green
I watched the world being reborn until one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know it was beautiful slow dancing
To tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love just like blood will always stain
And if I could reverse it I don't think it would be worth it
I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
No, I'll never let you go

Don't Get Me Wrong,The Pretenders,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pretenders/dontgetmewrong.html,"Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in awhile
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the 'mode of passion'
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong",1986,happy
Good Thing,Reel Big Fish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reelbigfish/goodthing.html,"I never felt too good but in this world who would
I was always thinkin√¢¬Ä¬ô somethin√¢¬Ä¬ô wasn't right

now I feel ok I hope it can stay- this way 

You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end
You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end 
Are these the good days that I've heard so much about-
there goes the heartbreak that I can live without 
I've been so frustrated, bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted all the things I've got
But now that you are here this anger disappears
and I feel happy too this is sappy but it's true

The Bird and The Worm,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/thebirdandtheworm.html,"If you're the bird
Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
I know the part, it's such a bummer

But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine
(Feel the shine)
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast a line
(Well, I'll try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
(It depends)
As they arrive
(If they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well,
Who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears

If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make
Each other blush
(you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well,
Who needs anemones?

You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

Pennies and dimes for a kiss

Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why,
Without you, it's hard to survive.

And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.

I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.

The good and the bad times: we've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.

The Saltwater Room,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/thesaltwaterroom.html,"I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?

Why does it feel so alone?

Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, Bar-B-Q. 
Look at all the people, happy faces all around. 
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds 

It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun. 
Get your green, green tambourine, let's play in the park. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun 

Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming 
and reaching for their food. 
Let's go buy an ice-cream and a magazine with an attitude 
and put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star 
cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la 

It's a bright June afternoon... 

There's a painter painting his masterpiece. 
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees, 
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon. 
All my life I've longed for this afternoon.",,happy

I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

The Rhythm,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/therhythm.html,"And for all of the sweet loving that
I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your soul?'

Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along:

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
'why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'

And she'll show you some rhythm

And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place
And continue to:
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and
Continue to -
She said I'll show you some rhythm

And she'll show you some rhythm",2003,happy
County Line,Sugarland,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugarland/countyline.html,"There's a place I like to go
Cherry bombs and cherry wine
Just past the Texaco
Down on the county line

Beer cans and cemeteries
Spanish moss on a welcome sign
Catch a buzz, we all get scared
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Kettle corn and 4H fairs
Pink slips and white wall tires
Bet you twenty I'll beat you there
Down on the county line

It's first love and football wars
A French kiss and battle cries
Further then I've been before
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

All the church yards and whitewash fences
All the widows and teenage brides
We're all searching for redemption
We're all looking for a sign

Down on the county line (down on the county line)
Down on the county line (down on the county line)

The best things in life are free
It's been right here all the time
It's everything that's home to me
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find ya
Out where we have a real good time
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Eye Know,De La Soul,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delasoul/eyeknow.html,"[POS:]
Greetings, girl, and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[DOVE:]
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[POS:]
Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

(Eye know I love you better)

[DOVE:]
It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee,
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two,
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything

Neurotic to the bone

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said ""My life's a bore""
So quit my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps

I'm carrying the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
this is how we feel

Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep

Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you 'bout it

The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket costs only your mind
The driver said, 'Hey man, we go all the way.'
Of course we were willing to pay

My name is Wepeel
I got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still makin' noise (makin' noise)

Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else?

Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

If I Ever Feel Better,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/ifieverfeelbetter.html,"They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life I can't control

They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait...

A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away

Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how

Breakdown,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/breakdown.html,"I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now I...

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down

This engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time
That I got to get to
Where I don't need to be
So I

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now",2005,happy
Kodachrome,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/kodachrome.html,"When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder
I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall

Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's
a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together
for one night
I know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse
in black and white",1973,happy

Should I address all my letters to the well to be
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done
Should I better not take it so personall if all the good loving is never received
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice

No not i..

I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah

Some guys were shootin pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage In this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
myself a ""J""
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began
to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away
The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor

I dont know
Higher now than ever before 
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now
Watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane 
That started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water
It ain't so sweet
You dont have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to 
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now

Hands Open,Snow Patrol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/handsopen.html,"It's hard to argue when
you won't stop making sense
But my tongue still misbehaves and it
keeps digging my own grave with my

Hands open, and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
the best thing that I have
Well, it makes it easier to know
exactly what I want with my...

Hands open and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
that your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

[x2]

Put Sufjan Stevens on
and we'll play your favorite song
""Chicago"" bursts to life and your
sweet smile remembers you, my

Hands open, and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it

The Sign,Ace of Base,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aceofbase/thesign.html,"I, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
Why, why do I bother
When you're not the one for me
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes

Mariella,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/mariella.html,"I'm heavy handed
To say the least
My mother thinks
I'll be an awful clutcher
'Cause I spill things from stirring 'em too quickly
I'm far too loud
It's like, as soon as I've got an opinion
It just has to come out
I laugh at stupid things
Just 'cause they tickle me

And
Sometimes I wish
Sometimes I wish I was like Mariella
She got some prittstick
And she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak
Never had to speak
Never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse
She just doesn't make a peep

She marched to her wardrobe
And threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious
But it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby
In patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms
And so she cried for hours

Mariella, Mariella
My pretty baby girl
Unglue your lips from being together and
And wear some pink and pearls
You can have your friends 'round
And they can stay for tea
Won't you just try to fit in please
Do this for me

But Mariella just crossed her arms
As she walked up the stairs
And she went into her bedroom
And she sat on her bed
And she looked in the mirror
And she thought to herself
""If I wanna play, I can play with me
If I wanna think, I'll think in my head""

At school, Mariella didn't have many friends
Yeah the girls they all looked at her
And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase.
But Mariella just smiled as she skipped down the road
Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yes, she always got the crossword puzzle right everyday
And she could do the alphabet backwards
Without making any mistakes

Mariella, Mariella
Pretty, pretty girl
Mariella, Mariella
Happy in her own little world
Happy in her own little world

And she said
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together
She said I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together",2007,happy
Music Is the Victim,Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/musicisthevictim.html,"I left my heart in San Fransisco 
I'ts at some motherfucking disco 
The people there where dancin' on it 
And that's including Ms. Matronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then som am I 

Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my bag in Pasadena 
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
Them bitches sure where crunked up on it 
I said I'd rather smoke som chronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I

Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my man in Houston Texas 
Just before he finished breakfast 
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 

Hell if Jesus had the power than so do I 
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by

Girl All the Bad Guys Want,Bowling for Soup,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bowlingforsoup/girlallthebadguyswant.html,"8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin' 
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me. 
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring, 
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means. 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She doesn't notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange 
Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad 
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty 
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She'll never notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

She likes 'em with a mustache 
Racetrack season pass 
Drivin' in a Trans-Am 
Does a mullet make a man? 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

There she goes again 
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair 
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated 
All I wanted was to see her naked! 

Now I am watchin' wrestling 
Tryin' to be a tough guy 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in my eyes 
I can't grow a mustache 
And I ain't got no season pass 
All I got's a moped...moped....moped..... 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 

She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want!

The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?

And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.

'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.

And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.

And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
Cause when I'm here I'm always something.

This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,

Mystical? Maybe

Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide

Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)

No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

After Hours,We Are Scientists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wearescientists/afterhours.html,"This door is always open,
This door is always open,
No one has the guts to shut us out.
But if we have to go now,
I guess there's always hope that,
Some place will be serving after hours.

This night is winding down but
Time means nothing,
As always at this hour
Time means nothing,
One final final round cos
Time means nothing,
Say that you'll stay
Say that you'll stay

We're finally drunk enough that,
We're finally soaking up,
The hours that everyone else throws away.
And if we have to go now,
I guess there's always hope,
Tomorrow night will be more of the same.

This night is winding down but
Time means nothing,
As always at this hour
Time means nothing,
One final final round cos
Time means nothing,
Say that you'll stay
Say that you'll stay
Say that you'll stay.

We're all right where we're supposed to be,
We're all right where we're supposed to be,

Dashboard,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/dashboard.html,"Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.

After you had proved my point wrong,
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh.

Hard-wired to conceive, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants.

I just want to be bothered with real love.

So I heard it's no good to run,
but it feels so much better now that it's done
and tonight I have to leave it.

So I've heard you know how to write it,
does it mean you're good at putting things on paper?
Rumours say that you're very sorry.
Oh no you're not sorry, no you're not.

If You Got the Money,Jamie T,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiet/ifyougotthemoney.html,"If you got the money,
I think it would be funny
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

An' all the boys they go:
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...

I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gum
While a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.

'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody the sound of spit
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
So toot what took man choke on it

We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?

Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap

If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free

With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead

Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter

With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

Move outta' the way man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray

And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay

Let the good times roll let the good times roll,
Cowgirl king of the rodeo let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start

Take off your overcoat you're staying for the weekend,
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

Good time to roll on",2005,happy

She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded

Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey (mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey (yeah)

Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?

Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong

Know Your Onion!,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/knowyouronion.html,"Shut out, pimpled and angry.
I quietly tied all my guts into knots.
Gave up on trying to make them,
I figured it'd take them too long to look up and besides...

It was undeniably clear to me i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew what worthless dregs we've always been.

Lucked out and found my favorite records
Lying in wait at the birmingham mall.
The songs that i heard,
The occasional book
Were the only fun i ever took.
And i got on with making myself.
The trick is just making yourself.

But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight...

Three thousand miles north east
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads.
""what kind of life you dream of? you're allergic to love.""
Yes i know but i must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me, i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are,
The selfless, loving saints we are,
The melting, sliding dice we've always been.",2001,happy

It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine),R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/itstheendoftheworldasweknowitandifeelfine.html,"That's great! It starts with an earthquake,
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;
and Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.
World serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs.
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no strength.
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down height.
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site.
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck.

Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
Look at that low plane! Fine, then.
Uh oh, overflow, population, Common Food,
But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right.
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light;
Feeling pretty psyched.

It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

Six o'clock. TV hour.
Don't get caught in foreign tower.
Slash and burn, return,
Listen to yourself churn.
Lock him in uniform and book burning, bloodletting.
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.
Light a candle, light a votive.
Step down, step down.
Watch a heel crush, crush.
Uh oh, this means no fear; cavalier.
Renegade and steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament,
A tournament of lies.
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline.

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

The other night I tripped a nice
Continental drift divide.
Mountains sit in a line.
Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev,
Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly beans, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right? (Right!)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

And I just want to be a part of this

The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew, 'cause it's hell on the engine 
You are the dreamer and we are the dream.
I could write it better than you ever felt it.

So hum hallelujah,
Just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you
It was just how you looked in the light.

""Till tonight do us part""
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith to hell with our good name.
A remix of your guts-your insides X-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills.
I could write it better than you ever felt it.

The taste of summer sweetness on my mind
It's a clear day
In this city
Let's go dance under the street lights
All the people in this world
Let's come together
More than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it

Come on over
Down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
Can't you feel that sunshine telling you to hold tight
Things will be alright
Try to find a better life
Come on over
Down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers there for one another
Come on over
Man I know you wanna let yourself go

Some people
It's a pity
They go all their lives and never know
How to love or to let love go
But it's alright now
We'll make it through this somehow
And we'll paint the perfect picture
All the colors of this world will run together more than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it

We may never find our reason to shine
But here and now this is our time
And I may never find the meaning of life
But for this moment I am fine
So",2005,happy
Two Shoes,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/twoshoes.html,"One day one woman asked him
'What do you to survive?'
He said 'oh my dear listen here'
And this is what he cried

On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
'Dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy

My knees they've got some cuts and bruises
From skating all my days
When I'm skating with my friends
My troubles drift away

I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
I like to move around
Cos getting down and jumping up
These are some good things that I found

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin

My waist it's got a slinky belt
With a clip that's quick to open
Because loving is the sweetest thing
And from my waist it happen

And my stomachs got some tasty food
That's making me feel good
Cos sharing some meals is something
I wish the world could do

And my chest it wears a singlet
Ah my chest it beating proud
My chest suggest I am a man
That no institution can knock down
And around my neck is superstition
Hanging from a chain
Because I've got my gods but in the end
I make my own way

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin

And my mouth it's got a great big smile
That shows some great big teeth
To friends it brings a happiness
And to enemies it brings defeat

And my eyes they've got some vision
That can see through many lies
Ah my eyes they look for better things
The better things to see in life

And my ears are wearing head phones
That do play my favourite songs
Not music I'm told to like
But the songs that make me dance along

Cos on my feet are shoes for dancing
'Dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy

Happy Jack,The Who,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/who/happyjack.html,"Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

Fire With Fire,Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/firewithfire.html,"You can see that you're being surrounded
From every direction
And love was just something you found
To add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one
But now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from
Some blazing arrows yesterday
You said, ""Fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire.""
Now the city blacks out the sun
That you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done
Your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone
Hiding out between the lines
What will we be when we come undone
Just a simple meeting of the minds?
And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
Underneath your skies
There's a million lights
Burning brightly just like fireflies
It's cold and heaven surrounds you from every direction
'Cause there's someone behind every hand
That you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
We've got a reason to be holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today
And we'll fight fire with fire

Fishies,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/fishies.html,"I left the house left the room with the foxy on my back
And my supplies in a magic pack
And I followed the sound of music
Not up a hill √¢¬Ä¬¶ but down to an old wharf shack

Inside I heard the trumpets call
I salute to the champions on the wall
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced

And the night she looked so fine to me
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
And so tie me to the mast I must believe!

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite
Still I kept the sight of my desire

And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
Lights dimmed but she shone like mythology
And I must admit she felt so alive

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

She waves for everybody down on the floor
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
And there we were in the depths of the wild below

Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
She whispered 'wait for the trumpets call'
It's not exactly love it's to adore 

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook",2007,happy

Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes Sunday girl

Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams Sunday girl

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home Sunday girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl

When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

Everyday Is a Winding Road,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/everydayisawindingroad.html,"I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He says he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low,
These are the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low

I've been living on coffee and nicotine

And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues

And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven

Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over

I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime

Heaven for the Weather,The Streets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/streets/heavenfortheweather.html,"I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

There's something in the sun this day, I feel it 
Or maybe it's just my hay fever 
The weeds are green, the sky is shining 
But it'll soon be night which is nicer 
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room 
And the devil gestures to you 
You've never seen such a Beelzebee 
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening 
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out 
What do you make of this doubt? 
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up 
Easy - I know what my speech should be 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me

The sort which leads you up the streets of sin 
He holds up paperwork - sign the line 
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine 
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet 
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreat 
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin 
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin 
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars 
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating - 
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven

But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather

You tell the devil in no uncertain terms 
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned 
What is this evil? And who decides this? 
When left to devices some humans try shit 
This is the reason we should all be tied up? 
We're just normal people exploring our minds 
We don't go around here putting poison in wine 
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right 
People are intricate, people aren't swines 
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds 
Sign on the line 
You sign on the line

When Did Your Heart Go Missing?,Rooney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rooney/whendidyourheartgomissing.html,"Love don't come so easily
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
I have you and you have me
We're one in a million
Why can't you see?

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing, yeah?

I meant every word I said
I never was lying when we talked in bed
I'm retracing every step in my head
What did I miss back then?
I was so, so misled

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?

I don't understand
How could you forget what we had,
It's so wrong

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?

Yeah!

Things were so good
We had a little dream
A little dream together
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
But you disappeared on me
And your heart, your heart went missin'
I don't know how to find it
I don't know where it is
I don't know where your heart went
It was here just the other day
Now it's gone
I'm gonna call the police
Call the investigator, the heart investigator",2007,happy

Get off this situation and feel fine,
Get off this situation and feel fine.

What did i do to deserve her love,
I have to ask myself.
When i am such a bad man but only to her (only to her, only, only to her)

You Owe Me an IOU,Hot Hot Heat,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hothotheat/youowemeaniou.html,"He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take

And behave like we're trippin'

All we need for some romance,
Go get dolled-up
And I'll pick you up.

There's no line for you and me
'Cause tonight we're V.I.P.

I see that twinkle in your eye,
You shake that ass and I just die,
Let's check our coats and move out to the floor.

When I'm dancing with you
Tomorrow doesn't matter.
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one who can get me on my feet.
And I can't even dance.

Just look at me, Silly Me,
I'm as happy as can be-
I got a girl who thinks I rock.
And tomorrow there's no school,
So lets go drink some more Red Bull,
And not get home 'till about 6:00.

When I'm dancing with you
Tomorrow doesn't matter.
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one who can get me on my feet.
And I can't even dance.

Everybody here is staring
At the outfit that you're wearing-

Cover's only twenty bucks,
And even if the DJ sucks
It's time to turn this mutha out!

I look myself in the eye

I fall upon the earth
I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare

Rainbows in the Dark,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/rainbowsinthedark.html,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a na√É¬Øve son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
We finally had front-page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the colour's so vibrant , the colour's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river",2006,happy

to rent a display home
avoid all the grey

the honey's stuck us by the hair

there's ice on the road
I bought us a dragon
to lighten the load
he's keeping us warm

Say I've never been stately
I'm legless at sea
my spirit has felt you since 1903
I'm trying to be normal
but there's evil in my head

everybody's gonna hide out back
it doesn't matter that you're serious
move along sad face your cover's blown
cmon there you are
and we're outta space and you're out of space
change the beat fast
or your enemies will see you naked

When we were out drinking
I found you a home
4 million in prizes
you left me alone
when we were forlorn
I found some poison in your bed
Though you may mistake me

he got a needle for a head

People Should Smile More,Newton Faulkner,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newtonfaulkner/peopleshouldsmilemore.html,"People should smile more

And you've got
Everything laid out for you
Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start another war
Keep buying, keep moving
This city, is sitting
Next to me
We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain

I can't change the world
'Cause trying to make a difference
Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people should smile more

And people should smile more
But the lights are so bright that they blind you
Just one more
Meaningless scientific breakthrough
The more we know, the less we care, what's damaged on the way
Keep moving, keep buying

We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain

I can't change the world
'Cause trying to make a difference
Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people could smile more
People should smile more

English Tea,Paul McCartney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulmccartney/englishtea.html,"Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea
Very twee
Very me
Any sunny morning

What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes
Fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

Miles and miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

Do you know the game croquet
Peradventure we might play
Very gay
Hip hooray
Any sunny morning

Miles and miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost suppertime
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning",2005,happy

The Boy Does Nothing,Alesha Dixon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aleshadixon/theboydoesnothing.html,"I got a man with two left feet

That his rhythms go go go

How you been?
I got a thousand lines
Where do I begin?
And I
I been here, been there
Traveling
I saw you at the corner
My vibe kicked in
And
Two fields
I clock you
Wearing tight jeans
A real nice suit
He was smiling like you
Was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance
He said 'yes please'

Take a sip of dancing juice
Everybody's onto you
Through the left and to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm
It's on tonight
I'm gonna feel the heat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

Work it out now
Work it, Work it out now

Do the mumbo
Shake it all around now

Everybody on the floor
Let me see you clap your hands

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

Must Have Done Something Right,Relient K,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/relientk/musthavedonesomethingright.html,"We should get jerseys 'cause we make a good team

I spend with you is the new best day of my life

It's jealously, they can see that we've got it going on

Maybe I'm just lucky, 'cause it's hard to believe
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
That we have got something real good going on

Super Honeymoon,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/superhoneymoon.html,"Glamour and fashion
Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember
She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air

So lovely...
She was everything to me

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault...
She was a gymnast, happily swinging
On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run

Gypsy,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/gypsy.html,"Broke my heart on the road

Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying but you can't always win

I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements

And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me

I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.

But, oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
It sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

Song Against Sex,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neutralmilkhotel/songagainstsex.html,"And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, ""Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string""
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream - 
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind 
So I'm always sober
Always aching 
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you...
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving - 
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.",1996,happy

It's like the apple eating people that we once were aren't there
Did they empty out their pockets and debase their younger faces
And you must make sure you're happy when you leave your summer places

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair there
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

I was very nervous how I felt in there
I was very cautious what'd you say
Hey there

Would you like to see me often?
Though you don't need to see me often
'Cause I'd like to see you often
Though I don't need to see you often

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!",2005,happy

You've got your dreams I've got mine too.
Be strong get off at the next stop.
Don't worry about a thing.
Keep taking it easy.
This time it's not personal.
The universe will help you now.
To find a place you can breathe.
And do what you've got to do.
Keep taking it easy.
Keep taking it easy.
Come on.
I'll let you borrow my four leaf clover.
Come on.
Take it with you, you can pass it on.
Come on.
You know I'm not the kind to say that it's over.
We'll be rubbing shoulders once again in the sun.
Come on.
Take your dreams, where nobody can find them.
Come on.
You know I won't be happy till you've won.
So come on.
Come on over, borrow my clover.
Is there anything left that you haven't done?
Go on do what you've got to do.
You've got your dreams I've got mine too.
Be strong get off at the next stop.
Don't worry about a thing.
Keep taking it easy.",2004,happy

Bones,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/bones.html,"Come with me.

We took a back road.
We're gonna look at the stars.
We took a backroad in my car.
Down to the ocean,
it√¢¬Ä¬ôs only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands.

But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, but on a heartbeat glide.

Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold, wet dirt I cry.
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry.

Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt you wanna come with me? Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
It's only natural.

A cinematic vision ensued
like the holiest dream.
It's someone's calling?
An angel whispers my name,
but the message relayed is the same:
√¢¬Ä¬úWait till tomorrow,
you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind.
I always hear them
when the dead of night
comes calling to save me from this fight.
But they can never wrong this right.

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
It's only natural.
Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt you wanna swim with me? Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?
It's only natural.

(Never had a lover)
I never had a lover
(Never had soul)
I never had soul
(Never had a good time)
And I never had a good time
(Never got cold)
I never got gold.

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones

Now everything has worked out to plan
But believe me it started as long as it can

Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know

Now put your feet back on the ground

And you try so hard
But your hearts on a switch
And I know you try so hard

What's My Age Again?,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/whatsmyageagain.html,"I took her out. It was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops, and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is Call ID?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

That's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?

Rewritten by machine on new technology

I met your children
What did you tell them?

We can't rewind, we've gone too far

You hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go,

You were the first one
You were the last one

I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, o.k. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/firstdayofmylife.html,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005,happy
Saint Simon,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/saintsimon.html,"After all these implements and text designed by intellects
So vexed to find evidently there's just so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night

Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside

There's no measuring of it
As nothing else is love

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing really holds a candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you",2003,happy
Soul Meets Body,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/soulmeetsbody.html,"I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel, feel what its like to be new

Cause in my head there√¢¬Ä¬ôs a greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
where they√¢¬Ä¬ôre far more suited than here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another√¢¬Ä¬ôs
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe it√¢¬Ä¬ôs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause you√¢¬Ä¬ôre the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

And I do believe it√¢¬Ä¬ôs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near

Good People,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/goodpeople.html,"You win
It's your show, now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people
Will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see?
Before we lose touch of
We thought this was low
Well, it's bad, getting worse, so

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one two,
Man, what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused,
Got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now whose side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting 'round feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
'Cause it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your reasons
It's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Bad news, misused, give me some truth
You got too much to lose

Whose side are we on today, anyway?
OK, whatever you say.
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation

My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan!

Squinched up your face and did a dance
Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants

knocking the aeroplanes down with stones.

'cause he quivers when he hears your song.

Believe me, it's safe to see,
At least be confused about right and wrong, 
Plan to settle down, 
Over the moon under the sun. 

Do the whirlwind, 
and shotgun the seat that beats (beats) 
Hanging on to the one you love 
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on.

Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation

And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful

My Interpretation,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/myinterpretation.html,"You talk about life, you talk about death
And everything in between
Like it's nothing, and the words are easy
You talk about me, and you talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's something, that needs repeating
I don't need an alibi oh for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
You toss me up and down
It doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?
If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation

It's really not such a sacrifice

If I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say

To a worn out 12"" of Marquee Moon

And we can go to that private view 
But darling these days my favorite view is you 
Lets just bend the invitation 
And leave our bikes down at the station 
Lose our sense of direction 
There's nothing here to lose 

Oh you will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly 
You're my love 
So come away with me 
Lets get lost till empty 

We could stay here till closing time 
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime 
We could dance till our feet turn red 

But the beats so boring 
And I'd rather be home in our bed 

This towns skipping like a record 
Reruns get me so bored 
So with enough that I can afford 
Lets get lost 
Again 

Yeah we will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly

The breathing gets harder, even I know that

It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today, today

I learned the hard way
That they all say things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

Did you walk - or did you run away?
Where are you now? Where have you been?
Did you go alone - or did you bring a friend?

[Hook #1]
I need to know this - cause I notice when you're smilin'
Out in the sun havin' fun and you're feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me

[Verse]
What went right? What went wrong?
Was it the story - or was it the song?
Was it overnight - or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

[Hook #2]
Or all the above - oh how I love to see you smilin'
And oh yeah - take a little pain just in case
You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smilin' face
Hey, put on a smilin' face

[Bridge]
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

[Hook #3]
I want to be you - whenever I see you smilin'
Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face",2006,happy
Have a Nice Day,Stereophonics,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stereophonics/haveaniceday.html,"San Francisco Bay
Past pier thirty nine
Early p.m.
Can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab
Stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of
But it turned out just right

It started straight off
""Coming here is hell""
That's his first words
We asked what he meant
He said "" where ya' from?""
We told him our lot
""When ya' take a holiday
Is this what you want?""

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day
Have a drink to chase
""Yourself and tourists, yeah
That's what I hate""
He said ""We're going wrong
We've all become the same
We dress the same ways
Only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Swim in the ocean
That be my dish
I drive around all day
And kill processed fish
It's all money gum
No artists anymore
You're only in it now
To make more, more, more

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day",2001,happy

Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),Garbage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garbage/cherrylipsgobabygo.html,"She gave you everything she had 
But she was young and dumb 
She'd just turned 21 
She didn't care to hang around 
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found 
This life can turn a good girl bad 
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

With your cherry lips and golden curls 
You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past 
And in your hot pants and high heels 
They could not believe that such a body was for real 
It seemed like rainbows would appear 
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear 
Because you looked just like a girl 
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts 
You make the whole world wanna dance 
You bought yourself a second chance

Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so"" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Came down upon his head

(La da da da, la da da, la da da)

Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Because at home they got her smacked

Zak called his dad about layaway plans
And Sara told the friendly salesman that:
""You'll all die in your cars,
And why's it gotta be dark?
And you're all working in a submarine""

(Asshole) 

She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped

Foundations,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/foundations.html,"Thursday night,
Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eye,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say.
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends.

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoyin'
And say something like
""Yeah, intelligent input darlin'. Why don't you just have another beer then?""

Then you'll call me a ""bitch"" and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

You said I must eat so many lemons,
'Cause I am so bitter.
I said, ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate,
'Cause they are much fitter.""

Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget,
But I can't.

Your face is pasty,
'Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
'Cause it's making me sick.

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these yesterday.
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this.

Well I'll leave you there 'til the mornin',
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile.
I know I should forget
But I can't.

And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile.

Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/meandjuliodownbytheschoolyard.html,"The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out he, began to shout
And he started the investigation

It's against the law
It was against the law
What mama saw
It was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, ""Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna put him in the house of detention""

Well, I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Good-bye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they come and
Take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest
Come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

And I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Good-bye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona

Do You Remember,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/doyouremember.html,"Do you remember when we first met? I sure do.
It was some time in early September
But you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find √¢¬Ä¬í you painted flowers on it
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon.

Well, I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all,
Over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine,
We're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You'd play me boogie woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are.

We built our get away up in a tree we found.
We felt so far away, but we were still in town.
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at.

Well, all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind,
We're locked in time
But you're still mine

Do you remember?",2005,happy
Sir Duke,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/sirduke.html,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over

And I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch

The time is getting closer
Oh who
Time to be a ghost

Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we been?

So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin

Oh who
The time is getting closer
Oh who
Time to be a ghost
Oh who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been, yeah?

Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see

Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town

Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes

I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Oh how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all",1998,happy

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
(I) just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said ""Grab your things,
I've come to take you home.""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
""Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" he said ""Grab your things
I've come to take you home.""

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant

But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song

Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me saying
""Get back together come back and save me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
'Cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
That vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

Threw your arms in the air
And said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault
Not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set a' better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides
And said, ""I'm sorry.""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?

The Owls Go,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/theowlsgo.html,"(Four, three, two, one)

Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground
How 'bout the tree back your house where the owls go
Or in between the attic and the basement
Somewhere it's not dark, dark, dark, dark

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
And don't go finding a replacement,
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart

Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that that it feels like it is ending

(Four, three, two, one)

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you

And you shout out loud
And you're bursting with pride
'Cause they don't let you talk
And your heart is finally mending

It's not too late now to change your mind
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line

An attic in a basement
Attic in a basement

And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that it feels like it is ending
It shouldn't feel like it is ending",2003,happy
I'm Like a Bird,Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/imlikeabird.html,"You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is 
(and baby all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

[Chorus]

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
Each and every single day I know 
I'm going to have to eventually give you away
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey I'm just scared
That we may fall through

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.,Noah and the Whale,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/noahandthewhale/lifegoeson.html,"Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes
That've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Loney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone

From the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said:

[Chorus]

You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way

What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home

Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

From the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say:

You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way

You've got heart and you're going your own way

On my last night on earth, I want to look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

Tire Swing,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/tireswing.html,"I took the Polaroid down in my room.
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend.
It's not as if I don't like you.
It just makes me sad whenever I see it.

'Cause I like to be gone most of the time,
And you like to be home most of the time.
If I stay in one place I lose my mind.
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride,
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason.
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan.
Paul Baribeau took me to the giant tire swing,
Gave me a push and he started singing.
I sang along while I was swinging.
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

Now I'm home for less than 24 hours.
That's hardly time to take a shower.
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall.
Check my e-mail, write a song and make a few phone calls.

Before it's time to leave again
I got one hand on the steering wheel, one waving out the window.
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My yarns will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
And even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.",2006,happy
Fighting in a Sack,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/fightinginasack.html,"Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
And had it nailed to my forehead again 
To keep this boat afloat 
There are things you can't afford to know 
So I save all my breath for the sails. 

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Walking a bridge with weakening cables 
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through. 

Most ideas turn to dust 
As there are few in which we all can trust 
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mind? 
So let's abandon that track 
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack 
Cause we are way too wise-assed for that. 

You might find some fools at your doorstep 
Hustling the latest changes to the book 
That's the strangest in an attempt to multiply 
Marionettes on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate 
Because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through. 

We've taken on a climb 
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs 
Walking up a slide 
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track.

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Crossing the brindge on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through",2003,happy

Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?

Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cuz I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)

Tambourine style, walking in a single file
You whisper half thoughts to me

And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

Sultans of Swing,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/sultansofswing.html,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south London town

You check out guitar, George
He knows all the chords
Mind it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band
It ain't what they call ""Rock 'n' Roll""
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole, Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home.""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing,
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing.""",1978,happy
All These Things That I've Done,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/allthesethingsthativedone.html,"When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on
Hold on

I wanna stand up
I wanna let go
You know, you know
No you don't, you don't

I wanna shine on in the hearts of men
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand

Another head aches
Another heart breaks
I'm so much older
Than I can take

And my affection
Well it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection
No no no no

Help me out
You know you gotta help me out
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out

And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be

You know you gotta help me out

While everyone's lost
The battle is won

The Sound of Settling,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/thesoundofsettling.html,"I've got a hunger
Twisting my stomach into knots

""if you've got an impulse let it out""
But they never make it past my mouth.

Baa bah, this is the sound of settling
Baa bah, baa bah

Our youth is fleeting
Old age is just around the bend
And i can't wait to go grey

And i'll sit and wonder
Of every love that could've been
If i'd only thought of something charming to say.

Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive!

I want to forget how conviction fits
But can I get out from under it?
Can I gut it out of me?
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
Can't let go of it,

Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,
You will not back up an inch ever,

It may not go over well
And it may not be photo-op
In the way that I spell it out

Holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital
I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
I'm the one who has the key
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too 

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up

I'm gonna soak up the sun

Little Secrets,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/littlesecrets.html,"When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
(higher, higher, higher, higher...)

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colours of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing

Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)

My life overturned
Unfair the despair

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

HAPPY?

What sets me free?

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

My Slumbering Heart,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/myslumberingheart.html,"In my dreams, i see myself hitting a baseball
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
I'm all tan and smiling and running from third base
It's hot and the kids keep on playing the driving game
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
And the sky is a bluish gray

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone

In my dreams, i see you at the foot of some mountains
And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
It's late and the sun keeps shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up

I've become just like a terrible mess
Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
But the crowds keep me coming back
Cheering

In my dreams, i see you asleep in a twin bed
The covers pulled up over your head
Am i asleep or awake?
It's morning and the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am i asleep or awake?

It just feels good when we're waking up
It just feels good when you're next to me
It just feels good when you're coming home
It just feels good when it's waking up
My slumbering heart

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone
I'm not a failure i swear
I wish you could see it from over there
I've got a lot over here without you
I've barely been gone

How to chase my blues away

Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye

Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye
Can help you from yourself

Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life

He says his name's William but I'm sure,
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on
the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

Otherwise the bar is ours,
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
cars
The sun and the moon but

Crooked Teeth,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/crookedteeth.html,"It was one hundred degrees,
As we sat beneath
A willow tree,
Whose tears didn't care,
They just hung in the air,
And refused to fall, to fall.

And I knew I'd made a horrible call,
And now the state line felt like the Berlin Wall,
And there was no doubt about which side I was on.

'Cause I built you a home in my heart,
With rotten wood meant to cave from the start.

'Cause you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I braved treacherous streets,
And kids strung out on homemade speed.
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep,
At all

'Cause at night the sun in retreat,
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth,
In the mouth of a man who was devouring
Us both.

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech,
But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I'm a war of head versus heart,
And it's always this way.
My head is weak, my heart always speaks,
Before I know what it will say.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No, you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

No, you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
There were churches, theme parks and malls,
But there was nothing there all along.",2005,happy

Hand in hand through their parklife

I get up when I want except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen

I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving the house

I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too
It gives me a sense of enormous well-being

City dweller
Successful fella
Thought to himself, ""Oops, I've got a lot of money.""
Caught in a rat race terminally

I'm a professional cynic
But my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the century's anxiety

Yes, it preys on him
He's getting thin
Try the simple life

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats
In the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills
In the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
Lots of rural charm
In the country

He's got morning glory
And life's a different story
Everything's going Jackanory
Touched with his own mortality

He's reading Balzac
And knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand
That makes you feel wonderfully bland
Oh it's a century's remedy

For the faint at heart
A new start
Try the simple life

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest
In the country
He doesn't drink smoke laugh
Takes herbal baths
In the country
But you'll come to no harm
On the animal farm
In the country

In the country, in the country, in the country

Blow, blow me out
I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out
I am so sad, I don't know why

She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.

You belong with me,
You belong with me.

In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see

Who understands you?
Been here all along.

So the summer is eternity for you?
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
He's shaking you down.

And the mailroom shift gets a real short shrift
As you dole out the packages, no-one seems to want you around
All skulking around.

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.

All a-drifting, he's a no-good boyo
Sent a-fishing for a whalebone corset frame
(His only catch all day)

So he sits and lets the current take him
A gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray
And at his ankles laid.

As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!

Let you legs loll on the lino

Centerfold,The J. Geils Band,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jgeilsband/centerfold.html,"Come on

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (wooh)
My memory has just been sold
(Angel is the centerfold)

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft, fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that neglig√É¬©e
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
Yeah, my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (oh yeah)
(Angel is the centerfold)

(Na, na, na...)

Yeah, now listen
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no Never-Never Land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take your car, yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (wooh)
My memory has just been sold

Alright, alright

Love It When You Call,The Feeling,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feeling/loveitwhenyoucall.html,"I found a switch
Turned it on
I hit the ditch

Are you quite sure
Just who you are

I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
O take a little time, take a little time

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call

Remember me, I used to be the best time buddy
That you couldn't wait to see
But getting old, it takes its toll
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold

I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
You could have it all
We should have it all

And I hope you enjoyed it
Now this would be our best song
That you have ever heard
The dirt bike's going on stage
Thank you

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where
The neighbors won't read meals

And the family heirloom jewelry
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never ever seen

Like the gods, like the glory, like the stories
That your fathers set before you
Ride the tiger 'round the kingdom, oh no
Oh no, there's a meeting in the canyons
Oh no, this is rising to the clouds

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

I'm shooting off the cannons
And the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave but the ones heap
Are the ones we'll never keep

Just pretend that things are mobile
And they're never staying put
And the way we were the day
We climbed to the top of the steeple

With it's people spewing angels out their mouths
And letting tables turn to charcoal
In the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening
Oh no, we were waving like the trees
Oh no, then they moved us to the sky

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

Two or three times the bell will ring
It's when we look for the better things
We search for this, we all have none
I feel it crash upon your skin

I find it hard to believe there's more
Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Do I miss you like you miss me?

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

Life is like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

'Cause broken legs can be replaced
Two steps to the finish line
Three sips 'til I finish mine
A straw will always suck it out

Beach was the place to go

Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a

Warmed up weather

Do it again

With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight

Been so long

Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend

Carried away from you

Sorry 'bout things that I've said

Once again we'd feel it
Higher education making sense

Justify your thesis
Certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defence

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can

Let's agree there's no need
No more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends

Wake up in the evening

Captains and Cruise Ships,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/captainsandcruiseships.html,"I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you",P:  ,happy

Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh - it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told.

Futures made of virtual insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad.
I know yeah

Of this virtual insanity, we're livin in.
Has got to change, yeah
Things, will never be the same.
And I can't go on
While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
Oh, this world, has got to change
Cos I just, I just can't keep going on, it was virtual.
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
That virtual insanity is what it is

Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have

Baby sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye

Then they'll give us a talking to
Then they'll give us a talking to

But not 'cause we want eternal sleep
And though our parts are slightly used
New ones are slave labor you can keep

With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty

Sunk in smoke dried faces
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no never), no not us (no never)
We are far too young and clever

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/yourbodyisawonderland.html,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em

Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was) and she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
Drifting this way and that
Not touching ground at all
Up above the yard

She isn't sure where she's gone

No time to think about what she's done

And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ""boom""
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ""boom""
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)

Animal,Miike Snow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/miikesnow/animal.html,"There was a time when my world
Was filled with darkness, darkness, darkness
Then I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something, something, something

In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
I knew before, long, long, long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up?

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal

There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money, money, money
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running, running, running
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
Who could be strong

Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up?

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip

You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way,
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,The Police,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/police/everylittlethingshedoesismagic.html,"Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve
As I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

(Every little thing she does is magic

If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about.

Like The Pips at they Gladys.

Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay.

You'll be my American boy, be my American boy.

Perfect Gentleman,Wyclef Jean,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wyclefjean/perfectgentleman.html,"(This one's goin' out to the strip joints
Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendez-vous
For every Go-Go Bar
I'm gonna send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs
Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex
I be seeing you all up in there late at night
I understand when your girl is stressing you out
(Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying?
Don't let the ladies fool you all now, fellows
They be doin' the same thing you all be doin'
Turn up my symphony, man.
Turn up my symphony!
Drop a BEAT!)

[Chorus:]
Just 'cause she dances go-go
It don't make her a ho, no
Maxine, put your red shoes on
We going to the disco
We gonna elope to Mexico
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo

[Verse 1]
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling down, type of tears that money couldn't buy

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2]
[Wyclef]
Excuse me, what is your name?
[Hope]
Uh, my name is Hope, yo
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses
Have you any idea how hard this is?
I could flex in 25 positions
But I only work here to pay my tuition
Yo, tantalizing teaser
Table-top pleaser
Give me what I need a Mastercard a Visa
Lap dance fantasy
Picture us on an all white canopy
Wyclef extended his hand to me
Like Billy D. said he's feeling me
Take me away from here, so far
Where they ride horses, no cars
No more stripping in bars
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds

[Chorus 2X]

(Yo a lot of you all sitting with you all girls
fronting like the Budweiser commercial
Talking about, 'I, I don't be going to the strip joints'
You're lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.
I got one question for you liars, man)

Shot callers, what are you, a preacher?
You're calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone.
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card
And told me if I ever have problems,
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2X]

Call up my mama said I'm in love with a stripper yo!

I tell you I got nothing but funny money, man.

All the Pretty Girls,fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/alltheprettygirls.html,"All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.

So I call your name, cross my fingers
Uncross the others, hesitate.
Oh, I don't think straight with nothing to prove.

I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I will stay until the weekend.
And you can take all your things;
The boxes and rings and get going.

'Cause I've been waiting for...

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, you'll come to me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

So I call (I call) you out (out, baby)
Just to feel a little bit better about myself (he does)
I do (you do), baby, I do, I do, I do
Until their lips start to move,
And their friends talk music
I say, ""I've never heard the tune.""
But I have, I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you.

Every single night ends up the same,
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name.
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be, you'll come with me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

But not you,
You still wear boots and your hair is too long
And then this one doesn't want to admit she's fallen in love
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things
That define you and me
Everything we've become,
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, you'll come with me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

But not you,
I feel your faith is destroying the world
And then this one never really understood
The 80s is over and done
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

The Calculation,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/thecalculation.html,"You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
Until we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so
Hey hey hey hey

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard 'til they sparked

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

Oo oo oo oo oo oo [until the song fades]",2009,happy

Good thing there's no mercy rule in love cause I would long be beat
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
Accept my loss and head back to the mound

How to touch you like I would

Though London girls aren't snobs at all
and Brighton's lovely in the Fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
Paul and Sorrel too
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley

Performing with the Apples
and then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
because we hadn't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station

in the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter",2004,happy
