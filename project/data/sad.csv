Without You,Harry Nilsson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harrynilsson/withoutyou.html,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
If living is without you",1971,sad
Down in a Hole,Alice in Chains,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/downinahole.html,"Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
In a tomb... in bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
Oh, you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now I'm a man who won't let himself be

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

Bury me softly in this womb
Oh I want to be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
Oh I want to be inside of you
In a tomb... in bloom
Oh I want to be inside...

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, out of control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied",1992,sad
Let It Be,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/letitbe.html,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer

This Woman's Work,Kate Bush,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katebush/thiswomanswork.html,"Pray God you can cope.
I stand outside this woman's work,
This woman's world.
Ooh, it's hard on the man,
Now his part is over.
Now starts the craft of the father.

I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you have a lot of strength left.
I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you have a lot of strength left.

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking

Of all the things I should've said,
That I never said.
All the things we should've done,
That we never did.
All the things I should've given,
But I didn't.

Oh, darling, make it go,
Make it go away.

Give me these moments back.
Give them back to me.
Give me that little kiss.
Give me your hand.

I know you have a lot of strength left.
I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you have a lot of strength left.)

All the things that you wanted for me.

Who Wants to Live Forever,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/whowantstoliveforever.html,"There's no time for us.
There's no place for us.
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us?

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us.
It's all decided for us.
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever
When love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,

And we can have forever,
And we can love forever.
Forever is our today.

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today.

Who waits forever anyway?",1986,sad
Fast Car,Tracy Chapman,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tracychapman/fastcar.html,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way",1988,sad

I lack the reason why I should be so confused,

I know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you,

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,
Playing the show and running down the plane,

No place to call home

My privacy is raked

The Eternal,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/theeternal.html,"Procession moves on, the shouting is over,
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,
Possessed  by a fury that burns from inside.

Cry like a child, though these years make me older,
With children my time is so wastefully spent,
A burden to keep, though their inner communion,
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden,
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,
No words could explain, no actions determine,
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.",1980,sad

Trapped in your hot car

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need

Lying in the reeds

We're strangers in an empty space

At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral

And coming up only to show you're wrong.

To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
For they don't have trees to hang upon.

Hey You,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/heyyou.html,"Hey, you!
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Don't help them to bury the light.
Don't give in without a fight.

Hey, you!
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey, you!
Out there on the road,
Always doing what you're told.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
Together we stand,
Divided we fall.",1979,sad
She's Leaving Home,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/shesleavinghome.html,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband ""Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)

She's leaving home
Bye bye",1967,sad

My burdens at the door

What I could never have

All this wasted
It's all inside
And I feel
All this pain
Stuffed it down
It's back again
And I lie
Here in bed
All alone
I can't mend
But I feel
Tomorrow will be okay

Tonight I Wanna Cry,Keith Urban,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/keithurban/tonightiwannacry.html,"Alone in this house again tonight

And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control

To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain

Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way

Cause I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control

Tears form behind my eyes
But I do not cry
Counting the days that pass me by

I've been searching deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
It feels like I'm starting all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said,

[Chorus:]
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right

[Chorus]

And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you
But I'm not giving in this time

And when the stars fall
I will lie awake
You're my shooting star",2000,sad

Through Glass,Stone Sour,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stonesour/throughglass.html,"I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, god it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope

So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins
Contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart
It never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
(Null and void instead of voices)

Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
And no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

The stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah

Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't someone missing me?

And if I bleed, I'll bleed
Knowing you don't care.
And if I sleep just to dream of you
I'll wake without you there.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't something?..

Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?

Can you stop the fire?
(please, please).
Can you stand to fight her?
(please, please).
You can't stop the fire.
(please, please).
You won't say the words.
(please, please).",2016,sad
Amie,Damien Rice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/damienrice/amie.html,"Nothing unusual, nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario, the same old rain
And there's no explosions here
Then something unusual, something strange
Comes from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?

Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
You know when you've found it,
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it when they take it away

Something unusual, something strange
Comes from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere

Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

And Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me",2003,sad

This life could be the last
And we're too young to see",2003,sad
The Blowers Daughter,Damien Rice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/damienrice/theblowersdaughter.html,"And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes...

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water

The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes...

Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you

Love Is a Losing Game,Amy Winehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amywinehouse/loveisalosinggame.html,"For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-storey fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Though you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",2007,sad
Happy Ending,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/happyending.html,"This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending

Like it's forever

But not together

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I'd guess I wish you well
Mm, a little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

No hope, no love, no glory

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

This is the way you left me

No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending

Little bit of love [repeat]
There ain't a better love
Little bit of love [repeat]
Need to be love, love
Little bit of love [repeat until the end]

Sad Eyes,Bat for Lashes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/batforlashes/sadeyes.html,"I don't like the things you don't say
Leaving it for such a long long time
Why do you show me those sad sad eyes
Each time you decide to pass on by

And when you smile those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still

Autumns hue in those sad eyes
Makes me love and love them more
I'll have a bath, I'll make the dinner and then I'll go away for a long long time
But still you haven't passed my door

And when you smile those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still

I can tell that you're lonely
But it seems now
There's nothing you want me to do
So I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love
Leave it open for someone else to

And when you smile those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still

Trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Sad eyes baby it's been such a long time
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
Come and spend the night

Trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Sad eyes baby it's been such a long time
Keep my heart breaking in the dark

It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more

Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon",2008,sad

What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down

What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask what I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new
No no just another phase of finding what I really need
Is what makes me bleed
And like a new disease she's still too young to treat
Like a distant tree
Volcanoes melt me down
She's still too young
I kissed your mouth
You do not need me",2003,sad
Streets of Philadelphia,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/streetsofphiladelphia.html,"I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the Streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the Streets of Philadelphia",,sad
Stranger in Moscow,Michael Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaeljackson/strangerinmoscow.html,"I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel

Raining In Baltimore,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/raininginbaltimore.html,"This circus is falling down on its knees
The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around
I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call
These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you paid for
But I just had no intention of living this way
I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat
And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same
There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?
I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train, baby, if I listen real hard
And I wish, I wish it was a small world
'Cause I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar
I guess it's time to put the top down
I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I really need a raincoat

Tiny Vessels,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/tinyvessels.html,"This is the moment that you know
That you told her that you loved her but you don't.
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.

I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me",2003,sad

She's good to me

She's a pretty thing
And she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's baby
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you've got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together
I'm nice to you
I could make it through
But you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile
If you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me, baby?
Because your candle burns too bright
Well I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
You're wonderful
And it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you
I'd disappoint you too

Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
What is closer to the truth

I just don't think I'll ever get over you

No longer moved to drink strong whiskey
I shook the hand of time and I knew
That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

A face that dances and it haunts me
With laughter still ringin' in my ears
I still find pieces of your presence here
even, even after all these years

I don't want you thinkin' that I don't get asked to dinner
Cuz I'm here to say that I sometimes do
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love

You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted

Where she belongs.

She wants to go home,
But nobody's home.
It's where she lies
Broken inside.
With no place to go,
No place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Open your eyes
And look outside,
Find the reasons why.
You've been rejected,
And now you can't find
What you've left behind.

Be strong, be strong now.
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs,
Where she belongs.

She wants to go home,
But nobody's home.
It's where she lies
Broken inside.
With no place to go,
No place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.

She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.

She wants to go home,
But nobody's home.
It's where she lies,
Broken inside.
With no place to go,
No place to go to dry her eyes.

As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was monday

That im going through

And when the night falls in around me
I dont think ill make it through
Ill use your light to guide the way
Cause all I think about is you

Well L.A is getting kinda crazy
And New york is getting kinda cold
I keep my head from geting lazy
I just cant wait to get back home

And all these days i spend away
Ill make up for this i swear
I need your love to hold me up
When its all too much to bear

And when the night falls in around me
I dont think ill make it through
Ill use your light to guide the way
Cause all I think about is you

And all these days i spend away

Snuff,Slipknot,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/slipknot/snuff.html,"Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...

My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your lights
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...

Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...

Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...",2008,sad
A Natural Disaster,Anathema,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anathema/anaturaldisaster.html,"It's been a long cold winter without you
I've been crying on the inside over you

And it's hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to go on and speak now of what's gone by

No matter what I do

I don't forget you, oh, it's so sad

I hope you can hear me

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

I hope you can hear me

I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened, you passed by

Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go

No

Was the day that I found it won't be the same

Follow the Cops Back Home,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/followthecopsbackhome.html,"The call to arms was never true,
Time to imbibe, here's to you,
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue,
Drum machines and landslides.

Just one more round before we're through,
More psychedelic yuppie flu,
It's such a silly thing to do,
Now we're stuck on rewind..

Let's follow the cops back home,
Follow the cops back home,
Let's follow the cops back home,
And rob their houses.

The call to arms was never true,
Let's take a ride and push it through,
Suspended animation in blue,
Blame it on apartheid,

Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's,
I'll give you coats and cheap shampoo,
I'll give you nothing else to do,
Now we're stuck on rewind..

Let's follow the cops back home,
Follow the cops back home,
Let's follow the cops back home,
And Rob their houses..

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses..

The call to arms was never true,
I'm medicated..how are you?
Let's take a dive swim right through,
Sophisticated point of view.

Let's follow the cops back home

Let's follow the cops back home
And Rob their houses..

Pierrot the Clown,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/pierrottheclown.html,"Leave me dreaming on the bed, see you right back here tomorrow, for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head, as the bruises turn to yellow, and the swelling goes down

And if you're ever around, in the city or the suburbs, of this town
Be sure to come around, I'll be wallowing in sorrow, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

Saw you crashing 'round the bay, never seen you act so shallow, or look so brown
Remembered all the things you'd say, how your promises rang hollow, as you threw me to the ground

And if you're ever around, in the backstreets or the alleys, of this town
Be sure to come around, I'll be wallowing in pity, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

When I dream, I dream of your lips
When I dream, I dream of your kiss
When I dream, I dream of your fists
Your fists
Your fists

Leave me bleeding on the bed, see you right back here tomorrow, for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head, as the bruises turn to yellow, and the swelling goes down

And if you're ever around, in the city or the suburbs, of this town, be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

Pieces,Sum 41,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sum41/pieces.html,"I tried to be perfect

My thoughts are so tempting
I donât know how it got so bad
Sometimes itâs so crazy
That nothing can save me

Cazando motivos que me hagan creer

Heartbeats,José González,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/josgonzlez/heartbeats.html,"[The Knife cover]

One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away

Both under influence
We had divine scent
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief

Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough",2003,sad
Sour Times,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/sourtimes.html,"To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me

'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times

'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do

After time the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....

'Cause nobody loves me

Not like you do

'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you
Nobody loves.. me

A Lack of Color,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/alackofcolor.html,"And when i see you
I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better
It picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around, turns you around

If you feel discouraged
That there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover
It's really bursting at the seams
For absorbing everything
The spectrum's a to z

This is fact not fiction
For the first time in years
all the girls in every girlie magazine
Can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone

To call at 7:03 [and] on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But i know it's too late
I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay [x3]

The A Team,Ed Sheeran,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/theateam.html,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

Go mad for a couple grams

High Hopes,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/highhopes.html,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever",1994,sad

Accidental Babies,Damien Rice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/damienrice/accidentalbabies.html,"Well I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place

And we ignored our others, happy plans
For that delicate look upon your face

Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows what we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands
And my foot in the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands
In the mild issue of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love

Do you come
Together ever with him?
Is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play?

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down.

Music played, and people sang
Just for me, the church bells rang.

And 'til this day, sometimes I cry

And made my way back home

I gazed a gazeless stare
We marked a million hills
I must have died alone

I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

They only hit until you cry
After that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore

Yes I think I'm okay
I walked into the door again
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown

Just don't ask me how I am [X3]

My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

And they only hit until you cry
After that, you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore",1987,sad

It must be for real 'cause now I can feel

It's not my time to wonder why

Everything's gray

I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

Don't let the days go by

I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
Are you at one or do you lie?
We live in a wheel
Where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields

I treated you bad
You bruise my face
Couldn't love you more
You got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by

Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me

You wanted us less
Could not kiss just regress
It might just be
Clear and simple and plain
Well, that's just fine
That's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you

Broken,Lifehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lifehouse/broken.html,"The broken clock is a comfort
It helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow
From stealing all my time

And I am here still waiting
Though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best
Like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain
There is healing
In your name
I find meaning

So I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm barely holdin' on to you

The broken locks were a warning
You got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded
I'm an open book instead

And I still see your reflection
Inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose
They're still looking for life

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain (in the pain)
Is there healing
In your name (in your name)
I find meaning

So I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm barely holdin' on to you

I'm hangin' on another day
Just to see what you will throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will, will be OK

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain (in the pain)
There is healing
In your name (in your name)

November,Azure Ray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/azureray/november.html,"So I'm waiting for this test to end
So these lighter days can soon begin
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly

I was afraid to be alone
But now I'm scared that's how I like to be
All these faces none the same
How can there be so many personalities?

So many lifeless, empty hands
So many hearts in great demand
And now my sorrow seems so far away
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain

But I turn them off, and tuck them away
Until those rainy days that make them stay
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs
And the words still ring, once here, now gone

And they echo through my head everyday
And I don't think they'll ever go away
Just like thinking of your childhood home
But we can't go back, we're on our own

Ohh...

But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself

So we're speeding towards that time of year
To the day that marks that you're not here
And I think I'll want to be alone
So please understand that I don't answer the phone

I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls
Until I can see nothing at all
Only particles, some fast, some slow
All my eyes can see is all I know

Ohh...

But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself

Set the Fire to the Third Bar,Snow Patrol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/setthefiretothethirdbar.html,"I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from 'A' to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their words mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground
I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms

I'm miles from where you are,
I lay down on the cold ground
and I, I pray that something picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms",2006,sad
Epitaph,King Crimson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kingcrimson/epitaph.html,"The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams

Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying

Between the iron gates of fate
The seeds of time were sown
And watered by the deeds of those
Who know and who are known
Knowledge is a deadly friend
If no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools

The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams

Confusion will be my epitaph

Cloudy Now,Blackfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackfield/cloudynow.html,"In a violent place we can call our country
It's a mixed up man and I guess that's me
The sun's in the sky but the storm never seems to end
It's a place of sorrow but we call it a home
And the darkest thoughts, yeah, I guess they're my own
There's wealth in the bank but there's nothing to show inside

It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now

In a special place that I call my life
The father was cruel and he lost his wife
But I don't see, either 'cause I live across the street
It's a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
A man who drinks just to drown the pain
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else

Shape Of My Heart,Sting,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/shapeofmyheart.html,"He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
[Studio version:] The hidden law of a probable outcome
[Live version:] The hidden laws of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

He may play the Jack of diamonds
He may lay the Queen of spades
He may conceal a King in his hand
While the memory of it fades

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart",1993,sad
Mockingbird,Eminem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/mockingbird.html,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)",2004,sad
One Last Goodbye,Anathema,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anathema/onelastgoodbye.html,"How I needed you
How I grieve now you're gone
In my dreams I see you
I awake so alone

I know you didn't want to leave
Your heart yearned to stay
But the strength I always loved in you
Finally gave way

Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Somehow I knew you could never.. never stay
And in the early morning light
After a silent peaceful night
You took my heart away
And I grieve

In my dreams I can see you
I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you
And it feels so real

I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love

And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And somehow I knew you would leave me
And in the early morning light
After a Silent peaceful night
You took my heart away
I wished, I wished you could have stayed

In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh Yeah

But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away

If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time...on my own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh Yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone

Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world
Mad world, mad world, mad world",2003,sad
The World at Large,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/theworldatlarge.html,"Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud.",2004,sad
So Sorry,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/sosorry.html,"I'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh actions of mine
When patience is in short supply

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh we, we could hold each other tight tonight

We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the ocean
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
No the answer isn't for us

[Live Version:
Oh, I'm sorry
But I'm hanging up my hat
No, I just can't go on
Mmm, that's how I feel until I hear that song]

I'm sorry
Two words I always think
Oh after you're gone

I Don't Love You,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mychemicalromance/idontloveyou.html,"Well, when you go
So never think, I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

Well, after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
Is where you ought to stay

Well, after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
Whoa, whoa

When you go
Would you even turn to say
""I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday""

Well, come on, come on

When you go
Would you have the guts to say

Ice Water,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/icewater.html,"Like I heard her backwards saying
""I can take one thousand showers
and never be clean""
Of course she lied awake

She is ten times heavier
Stronger, than you found the grave
Or ever was
He's got it down now

You know what I need
Who doesn't lie?
You know what I mean

If I'm ever in doubt you
Like you don't know
I am so, angry
I am so, at ease
I feel just like
Some great big disease

I think you need
Ice water
But the only thing that
You really hate
Is all its emptiness
I will swim
And I will drink myself to
Death

If I'm never in
Doubt of you
Like you don't know",1996,sad
Under the Bridge,Red Hot Chili Peppers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/redhotchilipeppers/underthebridge.html,"Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

Glory Box,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/glorybox.html,"I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away

Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look from outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
It's all I wanna be is all woman

For this is the beginning of forever and ever

It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Just give me a reason to love you",1994,sad
Existentialism On Prom Night,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/existentialismonpromnight.html,"When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,

I Am a Rock,Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/iamarock.html,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",1966,sad
If You're Not the One,Daniel Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielbedingfield/ifyourenottheone.html,"If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?",2002,sad
Time After Time,Cyndi Lauper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cyndilauper/timeaftertime.html,"Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Torn,Natalie Imbruglia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natalieimbruglia/torn.html,"I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified

You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for

Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

But you crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry

I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see

This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn",1998,sad
She's Lost Control,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/sheslostcontrol.html,"Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.
And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And of a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.

And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

Well I had to phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.
But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

I could live a little better with the myths and the lies,
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried.
I could live a little in a wider line,
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone,
To lose control. When here we come.",1979,sad

Comfortable as you are,

Still care

You say you see the light now 
at the end of this narrow hall

I wish I didn't give you all

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again

Remember when we'd celebrate
We'd drink and get high until late

Wake Up Alone,Amy Winehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amywinehouse/wakeupalone.html,"It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

His fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
There's this ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

His fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone",2007,sad
Two Beds and a Coffee Machine,Savage Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savagegarden/twobedsandacoffeemachine.html,"and she takes another step
slowly she opens the door
check that he is sleeping
pick up all the broken glass
and furniture on the floor
been up half the night screaming
now it's time to get away
pack up the kids in the car
another bruise to try and hide
another alibi to write
another ditch in the road
you keep moving
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
wonder how I ever made it through

and there are children to think of
baby's asleep in the back seat
wonder how they'll ever make it
through this living nightmare
but the mind is an amazing thing
full of candy dreams and new toys
and another cheap hotel
two beds and a coffee machine
but there are groceries to buy
and she knows she'll have to go home

another ditch in the road
you keep moving 
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
wonder how I ever made it through

another bruise to try and hide 
another alibi to write
another lonely highway in the black of night
there's hope in the darkness
I know you're gonna make it

another ditch in the road
keep moving
another stop sign
you keep moving on
and the years go by so fast
silent fortress built to last
wonder how I ever made it",1999,sad
Play Crack the Sky,Brand New,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brandnew/playcrackthesky.html,"We sent out the SOS call.
It was a quarter past four in the morning when the storm broke our second anchor line.
Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.
They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.
One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.
What they call love is a risk, cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own.
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out.
And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow.
Your tongue is a rudder.
It steers the whole ship.
Sends your words past your lips or keeps them safe behind your teeth.
But the wrong words will strand you.
Come off course while you sleep.
Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reef.
The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.
To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.
And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.
But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm.
But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.
We won't have to fight for long.
This is the end.
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear.
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath.
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea.
I spoke the words but never gave a thought to what they all could mean.
I know that this is what you want.
A funeral keeps both of us apart.
You know that you are not alone.
Need you like water in my lungs.
This is the end.",2003,sad
Indifference,Pearl Jam,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/indifference.html,"i will light the match this mornin', so i won't be alone
watch as she lies silent, for soon light will be gone
i will stand arms outstretched, pretend i'm free to roam
i will make my way, through, one more day in hell...
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...
i will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
i'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey i won't change direction, and i won't change my mind
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make..
how much difference...
i'll swallow poison, until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
how much difference
how much difference
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...",1993,sad
A Modern Myth,30 Seconds to Mars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/30secondstomars/amodernmyth.html,"Did we create a modern myth
Did we imagine half of it
What happened then, a thought for now

Save yourself

And sell a lie

Tonight's the last so say good-bye

Oh Mother,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/ohmother.html,"Whoa, oh, yeah,

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again

So mother, I thank you
For all that you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over,
""You deserve much more than this.""

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)
Together we always pull through.
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again

For everytime he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)
Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)

So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)
Together we always pull through (always pull through)
We always pull through
We always pull through

Never Too Late,Three Days Grace,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/threedaysgrace/nevertoolate.html,"This world will never be

It'll be alright.

To just stay alive

You're Not Sorry,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/yourenotsorry.html,"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore

I can't help myself
I can't break the spell
I can't even try

I'm in over my head
You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in

And my knees are weak
And my mouth can't speak
Fell too far this time

Caught in you
Lost in everything about you

Well you whispered to me
And I shiver inside
You undo me and move me
In ways undefined
And you're all I see
And you're all I need
Help me baby (help me baby)
Help me baby (help me now)

Cos I'm slipping away
Like the sand to the tide
Flowing into your arms
Falling into your eyes
If you get too near
I might disappear
I might lose my mind

Just a Dream,Carrie Underwood,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carrieunderwood/justadream.html,"It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt.""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh,
Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""

Just a dream

I'll keep stealing, breathing her.
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending 
One of us will die inside these arms 
Eyes wide open, naked as we came 
One will spread our ashes 'round the yard 

She says ""If I leave before you, darling 
Don't you waste me in the ground""

One will spread our ashes round the yard",2004,sad
A Long December,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/alongdecember.html,"A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California...I think you should
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass
And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should",1996,sad

Don't Give Up,Peter Gabriel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petergabriel/dontgiveup.html,"in this proud land we grew up strong

I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose

don't give up
'cos you have friends
don't give up
you're not beaten yet
don't give up
I know you can make it good

though I saw it all around
never thought I could be affected
thought that we'd be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn

drove the night toward my home
the place that I was born, on the lakeside
as daylight broke, I saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground

don't give up
you still have us
don't give up
we don't need much of anything
don't give up
'cause somewhere there's a place
where we belong

rest your head
you worry too much
it's going to be alright
when times get rough
you can fall back on us
don't give up
please don't give up

'got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
going to stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing
that river's flowing

moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job, so many men
so many men no-one needs

don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not the only one
don't give up
no reason to be ashamed
don't give up
you still have us
don't give up now

don't give up

Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/setfiretotherain.html,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it

But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever

When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

Romeo and Juliet,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/romeoandjuliet.html,"A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like ""You and me babe: how 'bout it?""

Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo. You nearly give me a heart attack.""
He's underneath the window; she's singing, ""Hey, la, my boyfriend's back.
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that.
Anyway what you gonna do about it?""

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah.
Now you just say, ""Oh, Romeo, yeah. You know, I used to have a scene with him.""

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said, ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.""
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
And says something like ""You and me babe: how 'bout it?""

""You and me babe: how about it?""",1980,sad

I'm being held up by an invisible man
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

Everyday Is Like Sunday,Morrissey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morrissey/everydayislikesunday.html,"Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench
Where your clothes were stolen

This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddonâcome, Armageddon! Come, Armageddon! Come!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard,
""How I dearly wish I was not here.""

In the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Comeânuclear bomb!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face, on your face, on your face, on your face

Everyday is like Sunday
""Win Yourself A Cheap Tray""
Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey",1988,sad

Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/goodriddancetimeofyourlife.html,"Fuck...

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life",1997,sad
Good Enough,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/goodenough.html,"Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough for you

Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself, and I don't mind
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough
Its been such a long time coming, but I feel good

And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
Am I good enough for you to love me too?

So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no",2006,sad
Dirty Little Secret,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/dirtylittlesecret.html,"If I had the chance, love
I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late

Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
I am willing, to give up this fight

I've been up all night drinking
To drown my sorrow down
Nothing seems to help me since you went away
I'm so tired of this town
Where every tongue is wagging
When every back is turned
They're telling secrets that should never be revealed
There's nothing to be gained from this
But disaster...
Here's a good one...
Did you hear about my friend
He's embarrassed to be seen now
because we all know his sins

If I had the chance love
You know, I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late

Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
I am willing, to give up this fight
Oh, I am willing to give up this fight...",2003,sad
When She Loved Me,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/whenshelovedme.html,"When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy, so was I, when she loved me.

Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me.

So the years went by, I stayed the same
But she began to drift away, I was left alone
Still I waited for the day, when sheâd say ""I will always love you.""

Lonely and forgotten, never thought sheâd look my way,
And she smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do,
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful,
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
When she loved me.",,sad

Talking to the walls

Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down,Interpol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/interpol/stellawasadiverandshewasalwaysdown.html,"When she walks down the street,
She knows there's people watching.
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Days
Daze
Days
Daze

She was all right because the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She is all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight, air tight
She broke away, broke away

At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
From crevices caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells
Stella, Stella, Stella, Stella I love you

[Chorus]

Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, love-joy diver
She went down down down there into the sea,
Yeah she went down down down there, down there for me, right on

So good, oh yeah, right on

There's some things you can't hide,

In a wave you say goodbye...)",2002,sad
Place to Be,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/placetobe.html,"When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place

And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be

And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh, so weak in this need for you",1972,sad

Look away

Momma please stop crying, I can't stand the sound

I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be
You'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family

Daddy please stop yelling (Stop), I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Make mama stop crying, 'cause I need you around
My mama she loves you, no matter what she says it's true
I know that she hurts you, but remember I love you, too

I ran away today, ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)
Don't wanna go back to that place, but don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growing up in World War III

I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name

We look pretty normal, let's go back to that

Heat the pins and stab them in

Just wish that it was bulletproof

Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself

I can't help you fix yourself

I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

Half Life,Imogen Heap,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/imogenheap/halflife.html,"I knew that I'd get like this again
That's why I try to keep at bay
Be a hundred percent when I'm with you and then
A perfect heart's length away

The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
You never promised me anything
Even sat me down, warned me just how they fall
And I knew the odds were I'd never win

yet here I am
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been 2 days and 8 minutes too slow
There may well be others but I still like to pretend
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with

You've got a schedule to stick to
Got a world to keep sweet
You're so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down? Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts to sign
Hold me darling, please

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

You know you'll never be lonely
You know you'll always be loved
And maybe you'll never need more than that
But of the surplus that loves, what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?

Long for one last showdown
From a box in the crowd, air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life",2009,sad
Too Much Love Will Kill You,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/toomuchlovewillkillyou.html,"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long

I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down

How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all.
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...

Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You've come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass

Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say,
""We have come now to the end.""
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again

And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass

To love you until your eyes run dry

She lives by disillusion glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar
Love me, wherever you are

How do you love with a fate full of rust?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
You've been looking for someone you can trust
To love you, again and again

How do you love in a house without feelings?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
I've been looking for someone to believe in
Love me, again and again

She lives by disillusion's glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar

How do you love on a night without feelings?

We've crushed everything I can see, in this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart

This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/firstdayofmylife.html,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005,sad

When evening falls so hard

Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

I got my maple syrup, everything but you.

I break the yolks and make a smiley face

Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see

And I was meant for you.

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used

Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, every day.

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down.
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight
'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.

Yeah, you were meant for me and I was meant for you.",1995,sad
How You Remind Me,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/howyouremindme.html,"Never made it as a wise man

This is how you remind me

Been to the bottom of every bottle

Bed Of Roses,Bon Jovi,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bonjovi/bedofroses.html,"Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano,
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head,
And some blonde gave me nightmares.
I think that she's still in my bed.
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead.

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French-kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe:
About love, the truth, what you mean to me.
And the truth is,
Baby, you're all that I need.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

Well, I'm so far away.
Each step that I take is on my way home.
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this pay-phone.
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through.
'Til the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
""Baby, blind love is true.""

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry.
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye.
Well, I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died.

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you.
While my mistressâshe calls me
To stand in her spotlight again.

Tonight I won't be alone,
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely.
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.",1992,sad

That she could feel 

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought I wouldn't have to be with you
Something new

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know that you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
You left my heart soaking wet
Boy your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
With me
Hiding

Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn't choose between
The shower or the bath

And I thought I wouldn't have to be
With you
A magazine

No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's clear he's gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay?
Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend
To run to

To leave behind some days

Ever turning
Never turn its eye on me
How could this love
Ever changing
Never change the way I feel

Your eyes catch the light
With promises that might
Come true for awhile

Farther than I should
Harder than I could
Just to meet you there

of two soft voices
blended in perfection
from the reels of this record that I've found.

Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me...
What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
growing increasingly unclear.

I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
all the other options held before me,
would wither in the light of my plan.

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
but there's only one thing on my mind
searching boxes underneath the counter,
on a chance that on a tape I'd find...
a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.

As we walk in fields of gold

Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold",1993,sad
These Are the Days of Our Lives,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/thesearethedaysofourlives.html,"Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago.
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect. You know?

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young.
The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know.
The rest of my life's been just a show.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you.

You can't turn back the clock,
You can't turn back the tide.
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
When life was just a game.

No use sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives.
They've flown in the swiftness of time.
These days are all gone now,
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you.

I still love you.",1991,sad

Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death
I can't say anymore than ""I love you""
Everything else is a waste of breath
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling you might fall
I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said ""Young man I do believe you're dying""
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
it's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
I want you
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""
I want you
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call his name out as he held you down
I want you
Oh no my darling not with that clown
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No-one who wants you could want you more
I want you
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
I want you
I want you

I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathomed that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling

I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life, baby
(in my life, in my life)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please

In a house on a street where you lived?

Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know

That I am
I am
I am

I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you

Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties
And one day passed away in his sleep
And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely

And I did feel like coming but I also felt like crying 
It doesn't seem so worth it right now 

And the castrated ones stand in the corner smoking 
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise 
At the site of a beautiful woman they feel nothing but 
Anger, her skin makes them sick in the night nauseaous, nauseaous, nauseaous 

Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely 
I've been hallucinating you, babe, at the backs of other women 
And I tap on their shoulder and they turn around smiling 
But there's no recognition in their eyes 

Oh summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage 
And don't get me wrong, dear, in general I'm doing quite fine 
It's just when it's summer in the city, and you're so long gone from the city

Disenchanted,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mychemicalromance/disenchanted.html,"Well, I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen,
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen.
I hate the ending myself,
But it started with an alright scene.

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing.
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, ""You won't feel a thing.""
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting

If I'm so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
How can you listen all night long, night long, night long?
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
Well, if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya

I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show 'em what we all mean

If I'm so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
How can you listen all night long, night long, night long?
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya

So go
Go away
Just go, run away.
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
But if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya, come on

You're just a sad song with nothin' to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothin' to ya at all
At all
At all
At all",2006,sad
How To Fight Loneliness,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/howtofightloneliness.html,"How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine you teeth til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies

And whatevers going down
Will follow you around
Thats how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
Thats how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time",1998,sad
Maybe Not,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/maybenot.html,"There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be
Look cross the land, shake this land
A wish or a command
Dream that I see, don't kill it, it's free
You're just a man, you get what you can

We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We can all be free
Maybe not in words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind

Listen to me, don't walk that street
There's always an end to it
Come and be free, you know who I am
We're just living people

We won't have a thing
So we got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind

You've got to choose a wish or command
At the turn of the tide, is withering thee
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
Pray to be, shake this land

We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We won't have a thing
So we've got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind

But with your mind",2003,sad

Surrender all the joy in my life
Go with her tonight?

In hours of pain 

My love is gone
Would it be wrong if I should
Just turn my face away from the light
Go with her tonight?",1995,sad
Twenty Years,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/twentyyears.html,"There are twenty years to go
And twenty ways to know 
Who will wear, 
Who will wear 
The hat.

There are twenty years to go,
The best of all I hope.
Enjoy the ride, the medicine show.

And them's the breaks for we designer fakes.
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye.

There are twenty years to go,
The faithful and the low.
The best of starts, the broken heart, the stone.
There are twenty years to go,
The punch drunk and the blow.
The worst of starts, the mercy part, the phone.

We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye.
And them's the breaks for we designer fakes.
But it's you I take 'cause you're the truth not I.

There are twenty years to go.
A golden age I know.
But all will pass, will end too fast, you know.

There are twenty years to go,
And many friends I hope.
Though some may hold the rose some hold the rope.

And that's the end and that's the start of it.
That's the whole and that's the part of it.
That's the high and that's the heart of it.
That's the long and that's the short of it.
That's the best and that's the test in it.
That's the doubt, the doubt,
The trust in it.
That's the sight and that's the sound of it.
That's the gift and that's the trick in it.

You're the truth not I.",2006,sad

You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
But since we're not together
I pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

How could I have been the one?

And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb

And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Always someone there

And there's no time left for losin'
When you stand they fall, yeah

Comin' down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Comin' down the years turn over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and

What you became to me",1998,sad
Where I Stood,Missy Higgins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/missyhiggins/whereistood.html,"I don't know what I've done
Or if I like what I've begun

And honey you know me it's all or none

Little voices whispering
That I should go and this should end
Oh and I found myself listening

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

See I thought love was black and white
That it was wrong or it was right
But you ain't leaving without a fight
And I think I am just as torn inside

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
This is what I have to do

'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you

Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside

The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind

But what can I say now?
It couldn't be more wrong
Cos there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Did we lose all the love that we could have shared

And its turning me round
And I can't find a way

Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been

Where you've had me for hours
Till I'm sure what I want
But darling I want the same thing that I wanted before
So sweetheart tell me what's up I won't stop no way

Please keep your hands down
And stop raising your voice
It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
It's a simple suggestion can you give me sometime
So just say yes or no
Why can't you shoulder the blame
Coz both my shoulders are heavy
From the weight of us both
You're a big boy now so let's not talk about growth
You've not heard a single word I have said...
Oh, my God

Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I haven't made half the mistakes
That you've listed so far
Oh baby let me explain something
It's all down to drugs
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
It seems I've stepped over lines
You've drawn again and again

And throw a living past away
So you can be sure that you're in control

Keeping ahold of what you just let go

Lover I Don't Have to Love,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/loveridonthavetolove.html,"I picked you out 
Of a crowd and talked to you 
Said I liked your shoes
You said thanks can I follow you?

No prying eyes 
I poured some wine 
I asked your name you asked the time
Now it's two o'clock, 
the club is closed we're up the block
Your hands on me 
I'm pressing hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth 
Trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know 
Who else may have been you before
I want a lover I don't have to love 
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time 
You said it feels good I said I'll give it a try
Then my mind went dark 
We both forgot where your car was parked 
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning
Bad actors with bad habits 
Some sad singers 
They just play tragic
And the phone's ringing 
And the van's leaving 
Let's just keep touching
Let's just keep keep singing
I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind
But you but you 
You write such pretty words
But life's no story book 
Love's an excuse to get hurt 
And to hurt 
""Do you like to hurt?"" 
""I do! I do!""
""Then hurt me."" [fades]",2002,sad

Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain, cause when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault

Find a girl, settle down

How can misery feel so sweet? 
How can you let me watch you sleep, 
Then break my dreams the way you do? 
How can I have got in so deep? 
Why did I fall in love with you? 

[CHORUS:]
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been 
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen, 
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known, 
I was never crazy on my own... 
And now I know that there's a link between the two, 
Being close to craziness and being close to you. 

How can you make me fall apart 
Then break my fall with loving lies? 
It's so easy to break a heart; 
It's so easy to close your eyes. 
How can you treat me like a child 
Yet like a child I yearn for you? 
How can anyone feel so wild? 
How can anyone feel so blue?

Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""

So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while""
He shook his head and said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please""

I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""

He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day

it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

Wondering how long it'll take

It's the easiest line you could break
She's been going about her business as usual
Always with that melancholy smile
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
To see those tiny tears in her eyes

Tiny tears make up an ocean
Tiny tears make up a sea
Let them pour out, pour out all over
Don't let them pour all over me

How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
Someone you said you'd always be there for
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
When those tears start rolling you'll be back

Tiny tears...

You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
But now it seems that moment has arrived
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight

The River,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/theriver.html,"I come from down in the valley 
where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
when she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
and man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
and the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
they haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
that sends me down to the river 
though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight 
Down to the river 
my baby and I 
Oh down to the river we ride",1980,sad

When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonight you tonight

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you
Another brick that I laid
From my body I could show you
A place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?

Three, four

You don't mean nothing at all to me
You don't mean nothing at all to me",2006,sad
Photograph,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/photograph.html,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me...",2005,sad
Who Knew,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/whoknew.html,"You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh
That's right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no
No no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
'fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better
Still you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Yeah yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we
Until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss
I'll cherish
Until we meet again
And time makes
It harder
I wish I could remember

From desolation and despair

Is being swept away

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same

One,Aimee Mann,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aimeemann/one.html,"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one

""No"" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

One is the loneliest number, much much worse than two
One is the number divided by two

One,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/one.html,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
If you've got someone to blame?

You said one love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing now
It's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other and we're doing it again

You said love is a temple
Love the higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law

You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
I can't be holding on
To what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sister
Brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

Landlocked Blues,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/landlockedblues.html,"If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And ones pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up I say ""enough is enough,
If you walk away, I'll walk away""
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon 

And the world's got me dizzy again
You think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
If you love something, give it away

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke 
We're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
Cause we're coming for you!

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying ""let me walk away, please""
You'll be free child once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn
Putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to",2005,sad

Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,Backstreet Boys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/backstreetboys/showmethemeaningofbeinglonely.html,"Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart

So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun

They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

I never was there
Was there when it counts
I get my way
You're so like me
You seemed ashamed
Ashamed that I was
A good friend of American soldiers
I'll say it loud here by your grave
Those angels can't
Ever take my place
Somewhere where the orchids grow
I can't find those church bells
That played when you died
Played Gloria
Talkin bout

You got a playboy mommy
Come home
But when you tell them soldiers my name
And cross that bridge all on your own

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night, thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time, that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same
That was until the day before the day",2008,sad

People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be

A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears

Closing your eyes to disappear,
You pray your dreams will leave you here;
But still you wake and know the truth,
No one's there...

Say goodnight,
Don't be afraid,
Calling me, calling me as you fade to black.

See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
In your silhouette window light go
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs,
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows, go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on an
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers
And goodnight to Mathilda, too",1976,sad

And its water will wash away my sin

has one chance to fuck up their lives
Like a cut down tree, I will rise again
I'll be bigger, and stronger than ever before

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back

There's a hope in every new seed
And every flower that grows on the Earth
And though I love you, and you know that
Well I no longer know what that's worth
And I'll come back to you, in a year or so
And rebuild ready to become
Oh the person, you believed in
Or the person that you used to love

If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back",2009,sad

Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that
I'm alright
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and
We can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and
We can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
Nothing's gonna make this right again (right again)
Please don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard
Just to talk to you
But you don't understand (you don't understand)

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and
We can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and
We can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect",2002,sad
In This River,Black Label Society,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacklabelsociety/inthisriver.html,"I've been around this world
Yet I see no end
All shall fade to black again and again
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

[Chorus:]
In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

Withdrawn I step away
Just to find myself
The door is closed again
The only one left
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

Another Lonely Day,Ben Harper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benharper/anotherlonelyday.html,"Yes indeed I'm alone again
and here comes emptiness crashing in
it's either love or hate
I can't find in between
cause I've been with witches
and I have been with a queen

it wouldn't have worked out any way
so now it's just another lonely day
further along we just may
but for now it's just another lonely day

wish there was something
I could say or do
I can resist anything
but temptation from you
but I'd rather walk alone
than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself
than let you drag me down

it wouldn't have worked out any way
and now it's just another lonely day
further along we just may
but for now it's just another lonely day

yesterday seems like a life ago
cause the one I love
today I hardly know
you I held so close in my heart oh dear
grow further from me
with every falling tear

it wouldn't have worked out any way
so now it's just another lonely day
further along we just may
but for now it's just another lonely day",1995,sad
Split Screen Sadness,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/splitscreensadness.html,"And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
Where you say it's alright
You got your heart right

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat
Wait on the porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight

We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight [x4]

""All you need is love"" is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters

And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat
Wait on the porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

[x2]
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)

I called because I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right...
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right...
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right...
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right...

Not as We,Alanis Morissette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/notaswe.html,"Reborn and shivering
Spat out on new terrain

Unsure unconvincing
This faint and shaky hour

Day one day one start over again
Step one step one
I'm barely making sense for now
I'm faking it 'til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we

Gun shy and quivering
Timid without a hand

Feign brave with steel intent
Little and hardly here

Day one day one start o-over again
Step one step one
With not much making sense just yet
I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we

Eyes wet toward
Wide open frayed
If God's taking bets
I pray He wants to lose

Day one day one start over again
Step one step one
I'm barely making sense just yet
I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch begin again but this time I as I
And not as we",2008,sad
Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,Alicia Keys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliciakeys/trysleepingwithabrokenheart.html,"Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Need me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end Oh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's bout to fall apart
So rather than hold onto a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you",2009,sad

Nothing is making sense anymore to me

From one mother to the other

Our angels are falling and they will warm us

The Last Song I'm Wasting on You,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/thelastsongimwastingonyou.html,"Sparkling grey,
They're my own veins.
Any more than a whisper,
Any sudden movement of my heart.
And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away

Just get through this day

Give up your way, you could be anything,
Give up my way, and lose myself, not today
That's too much guilt to pay

Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way

You're just so pretty in your pain

Give up my way, and I could be anything
I'll make my own way
Without your senseless hate... hate... hate... hate.

So run, run, run
And hate me, if it feels good.
I can't hear your screams anymore

You lied to me
But I'm older now
And I'm not buying baby

Demanding my response
Don't bother breaking the door down
I found my way out

And you'll never hurt me again.",2016,sad
Best of Me,Sum 41,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sum41/bestofme.html,"It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
I'll make everything alright
All these things that I've done
Now what have I become, and where'd I go wrong?
I don't mean to hurt, just to put you first
I won't tell you lies (I'm sorry)
I will stand accused 
With my hand on my heart
I'm just trying to say

I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me

I know that I can't take 
back all of the mistakes
But I will try
Although it's not easy
I know you believe me
Cause I would not lie
Don't believe their lies
Told through jealous eyes
They don't understand (I'm sorry)
I won't break your heart
I won't bring you down
But I will have to say

Bottom of the Ocean,Miley Cyrus,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mileycyrus/bottomoftheocean.html,"It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you baby

It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

Do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

In a dream you appeared
For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I'll draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep re-living

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

This is it
Let go
Breathe

You don't have to love me
For me to, baby, ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy
Cause I don't want to hold you
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy

Do do do
Do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do
Be happy

Mmmm....
Be happy",2008,sad

And I know you're on to me
That I only come home
When I'm so all alone

That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And I shall believe
And I shall believe

Open the door
And show me your face tonight
I know it's true
No one heals me like you
And you hold the key

Never again
would I turn away from you
I'm so heavy tonight
But your love is alright
And I do believe

That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly
You won't give up on me

Title and Registration,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/titleandregistration.html,"The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it.
So i'm proposing a swift orderly change.

Cause behind its door there's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all i find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life.

I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When i stumbled upon pictures i tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head

Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here i rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here i rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night (up all night)
When i'm lying awake at night.",2003,sad
Things Behind the Sun,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/thingsbehindthesun.html,"Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth

Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say?

Look around you find the ground
Is not so far from where you are
But donât be too wise

For down below they never grow
Theyâre always tired and charms are hired
From out of their eyes

Never surprise

Take your time and youâll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see whatâs meant to be
Donât name the day or try to say
It happened before

Donât be shy you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done
If only you see

Just what you are beneath a star
That came to stay one rainy day
In autumn for free

Yes, be what youâll be

Please beware of them that stare
Theyâll only smile to see you while 
Your time away

And once youâve seen what they have been
To win the earth just wonât seem worth
Your night or your day

Whoâll hear what I say

Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes thatâs today
And open wide the hymns you hide
Youâll find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what youâll say

About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people round your head
Who say everythingâs been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain",1972,sad
River Man,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/riverman.html,"Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves.

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me.

Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go.",1969,sad
Right Here Waiting,Richard Marx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardmarx/rightherewaiting.html,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you",1989,sad
In My Life,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/inmylife.html,"There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life
I love you more",2002,sad
Someone Great,LCD Soundsystem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lcdsoundsystem/someonegreat.html,"I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming, 
Till the day it stops
[x3]
And it keeps coming,
[x7]
Till the day it stops.

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I could have started,
Too late, for beginnings.
You're smaller than my wife imagined,
Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.

We're safe, for the moment.
Saved, 
For the moment.",2007,sad
You Know I'm No Good,Amy Winehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amywinehouse/youknowimnogood.html,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy
He's in a place, but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we're married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet

Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I told you I was trouble

She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her

In between molecules
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide 

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 

You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, 'Hey baby
I just might take the chance'
You say, 'It's a good thing
That you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way
I will crush your pretty
Toenails into a thousand pieces.' 

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 

Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...
Only in dreams...

my sea to your shore

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then
I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

[Instrumental interlude]

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark
Living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do

Other Side of the World,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/othersideoftheworld.html,"Over the sea and far away
She's waiting like an iceberg
Waiting to change
But she's cold inside
She wants to be like the water

All the muscles tighten in her face
Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same
Just like water

[Chorus:]
The fire fades away
Most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world to me

On comes the panic light
Holding on with fingers and feelings alike
But the time has come
To move along

[Chorus]

Can you help me?
Can you let me go
And can you still love me
When you can't see me anymore

Kiss,Korn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/korn/kiss.html,"Some deny and search for things that never come around
Do I feel like a fool?
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared
And I owe this all to you

I'm feeling like I'm sinking
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

The last thing I would like to do before I go away
is cry there next to you (next to you)
Cry and talk about the good old days and where they've gone
And now how much I hate you

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

I feel the blood drip off my body as it falls right there
on the ground
What am I now?

What am I now?
What am I now?

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?

Cure For the Enemy,Billy Talent,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billytalent/curefortheenemy.html,"Time drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads

We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spend the time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

We said that we would call
But we never spoke at all
The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
For reasons that seem so small
If this is the end, let's bury the past
This might be our one last chance
Together until the last grain of sand
Has dropped from the hourglass

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy
All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to breath
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(Count the days down to one last breath)
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
(In darkness we'll rest)

Rainin' You,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/raininyou.html,"When I looked out today
And saw that the sky was gray
I thought about the way
You loved days like this

And driving in to town
It really started coming down
Bringing me back around
To all that I miss

It feels like it's rainin' you
It feels like it's rainin' you

I didn't even run inside
Or worry about staying dry
Besides there nowhere I can hide
These feeling now

Running down my face
Takes me to another place
I can't think of a better way to drown

It feels like it's rainin' you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's rainin' you

If I had my way
It would do this every day
I would never see the sun
Because the closest I get
To holding you again
Is every time that sky opens up

It feels like it's rainin' you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's rainin' you
It feels like it's rainin' you",2005,sad
Who You'd Be Today,Kenny Chesney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennychesney/whoyoudbetoday.html,"Sunny days seem to hurt the most.
I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
I feel you everywhere I go.
I see your smile, I see your face,
I hear you laughin' in the rain.
I still can't believe you're gone.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who'd you be today?

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family,
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue,
I feel like I can talk to you,
An' I know it might sound crazy.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who you'd be today?

Today, today, today.
Today, today, today.

I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
The only thing that gives me hope,
Is I know I'll see you again some day.

Looking In,Mariah Carey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariahcarey/lookingin.html,"You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say, ""She takes it all for granted""
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well, here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me",1995,sad

In a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet
It was wild
And oh how we...
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey
Cling to me

Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home

I Miss My Sky (Amelia Earhart's Last Days),Heather Nova,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heathernova/imissmyskyameliaearhartslastdays.html,"I bury myself in the leaves to sleep
The sun so strong and rage so deep 
I keep waking to find I've been dreaming again
And the sound of the ocean is not a plane 
And far away they talk about me
In newspaper columns they write about me
round dinner tables and cocktail parties
I'm a heroine and a tragic figure
I'm a heroine as I'm lying here
Beneath my sky

And sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Why we're always coming down
And why we need to touch the ground
And why I didn't keep on heading
right on up to heaven
I miss my sky

Here from below the clouds are shadows
Not the golden mountains I used to fly through
Here from below the sky?s a painting 
In a child's room with the future waiting
But not for me

I look up at the birds flying overhead
My sentinel's true but the signals dead
It's been 500 days of hope and sorrow
500 nights with no tomorrow
And the poetry and the best of me
And the heart and the spirit and the sex of me
All fell into the azure sea
In the tailspin with the last of me
And my wings, and my song, all that I knew is dead and gone
I'm weak and tired but my will is strong
And my hope lives on, my hope lives onS

But sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Why we're always coming down
Why we need to touch the ground
Why I didn't keep on heading
Right on up to heaven
I miss my sky
I miss my sky",2005,sad

Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind

Livin' in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can't be for you

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry?

I could say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm",2014,sad

It's the same old wind again that calls me
- bye, bye -
on an ordinary day.
Bye, bye -
have you ever felt this lack of freedom
- bye, bye -
have you ever felt this way.

Leave it, don't leave it - I have to leave,
I can't go on pretending.
Nothing is real, don't you feel
that every road is ending.
Don't ask why i have to leave you,
don't you try, there have to be two.

we will never find a way,
we will always run on empty,
we will always run away.

We will never find the answer

we can't walk this way together,
we cannot take each others hand.

I've said it all - holy eyes -
no more sweet surrender.
Forget it all - no more lies,
soon we will remember that
everything we tried to change
stayed always and always and always 
the same.

I was ashamed but now I know
that we got different roads to follow,
that we got different ways to go.

We will never find a reason.

Leaving you has been the best thing for me

Shadows and Regrets,Yellowcard,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yellowcard/shadowsandregrets.html,"I'm back, back in town
And everything has changed

And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest

Say things I take back
If I could, could retell
And make these stories last

Of who you'll always be

For everyone to just go on 
And I've tried and I can't do it 
'Cause I'm still torn 
I've tried to think of you 
As just another love in my past 
That didn't last 
But it's not that simple baby

You may see me staring 
Or catch me in a daze 
May see me hang my head

And expect me to behave 
I might just steal a kiss 
If you come near my face 
What I'm trying to say

Que barre el viento

Que una vez
Juntos empezamos tu y yo
Y sin razon olvidamos
Quiza ese amor escondido este
En un atardecer
En la brisa o en la flor
Esperando tu regreso

Quiet As A Mouse,Margot & the Nuclear So and So's,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/margotthenuclearsoandsos/quietasamouse.html,"Tourists rob you of your home 
In sunken boats
You can hide quiet as a mouse
But they'll find you out

You can stay with me at my house.""

When I woke my back was broke from lying on the floor
Sunlight poured through all the cracks in my front door
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

Tourists robbed me of my child
They smoked him out
He was draft dodging some war
Until they found him out

He came home late in the night
To his mom and me
And he said, ""Times they gotta change,
But so do we.""

When I woke I was alive in somebody's room
I felt life and love and hope infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

When I woke my body was dying all over the floor
I felt apathy and hate infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you",2006,sad
Do I Have To Cry For You,Nick Carter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcarter/doihavetocryforyou.html,"Don't wanna close the door,

There Is None,The Working Title,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/workingtitle/thereisnone.html,"[Verse 1]

I couldn't find you
Last night for quite some time
Wishing to tell you
Everything running through my mind
We would have drove down
Over the bridge and towards the sea
Parking the sad car
In between 24th and 5th

[Chorus]

I want to write a song about our love
But there is none

[Verse 2]

Still I continue
Driving the lonely road
My thoughts running over
Humming a sad forgotten song
Wasting all our time
That you're spending with someone else

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Satiate my mind
And calm my nerves to look and find
Words that aren't enough
And never show a single piece of my mind

Happiness,Dance Gavin Dance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dancegavindance/happiness.html,"Drowning in the lake
I only left her for a couple of seconds

And now she's gone

Waking up for what?
As I pace back and forth
Maybe it's time to move away
But what would that prove anyway?

Over and over
Only to hear your voice one more time
Just one more time

It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying

Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?

Beg me for directions
Like I have all the answers
I neglected her life
Now what, what do I do with mine?

Somehow they're entwined with you
No regrets I'm glad it's through and you
Left my mind

Rainy Sundays, kids TV
Fish and chips in NYC
You said we were meant to be
To be

Those super bossa nova nights
Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last
For all eternity

No regrets, no memories
Just forget those heart felt pleas
No regrets, no baby
Not for me

Deform to Form a Star,Steven Wilson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevenwilson/deformtoformastar.html,"Oh once in a while
I learn how to smile
Horses shadows and rain on stone

No god here I'm sure
This must be the cure
For all this carrion and aimless drift

Retreat from the begging
And invites to the wedding
Revelation means nothing here

In time we forget our
Need to devour
All the stories of tortured souls

Crawl into your arms
Become the night forever
Coiled and close, the moment froze
Deform to form a star
Here on earth together
I got time to share and a well used stare

This smile isn't pure
Certain or sure
Cold precision was never there

The way we uncoil
Return to the soil
Flaws are everything and chaos reigns",2011,sad
Rite of Spring,Angels & Airwaves,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/angelsairwaves/riteofspring.html,"I was locked all day in the summer heat,
In a small brown house in Suburban Street,
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I'd dream all day that they would get me far,
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen, 
Got kicked out of school, and so it seemed
that things were closing in and ready to blow,
My dad moved out about that year or so,
It took an hour to start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I held my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for has come to pass
From Rock N Roll, to love and cash
Itâs all success if itâs what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh oh 
Hey yo oh oh 

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldnât change a thing

Save Your Love,Great White,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatwhite/saveyourlove.html,"I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream you'll always be
Till the end of time

I look in your eyes they touch my soul
My love is hard to hide
I'm never alone when we're apart
I feel you by my side

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
I know who you are
So lock the door and throw away the key

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

I wake from a dream
And see you by my side
How could I belong to someone else
When holding you feels so right?

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
We've made it so far
So lock the door and throw away the key

Save all your love
Save your love for me

Mockingbird,Low Millions,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lowmillions/mockingbird.html,"Here come the nightingales, or could it be the mockingbird, they're at my windowsill, they flew in as
soon as they heard.
Enter the doctor and the nurse, say my condition's getting worse, they take my pulse and shake their
heads, they recommend I stay in bed.
They say you are my condition, you are indecision, you, what is wrong with you?

You say you love me but you don't love me, you say you hate me but you don't hate me, you say you'd
leave me but you can't leave me, because you love me, what's it gonna be, what is wrong with you, what
is wrong with me.

Here goes nothing, I just swallowed the pill, the room's spinning out of control, although I'm lying
still. And those mockingbirds, they're hovering above, they're talking about the trouble with our love.

You say you love me but you don't love me, you say you hate me but you don't hate me, you say you'd
leave me but you can't leave me, because you love me, what's it gonna be, what is wrong with you, what
is wrong with me.

Oh my God, I think I've actually lost the plot. Oh my God, my brain is fried and my nerves are shot.
And why not, you say control me no don't control me, you say hold me no don't hold me, you say you'd
marry me, but you can't marry me.

Because you love me but you don't love me, because you hate me but you don't hate me, because you'd
leave me but you can't leave me, here come the mockingbirds.

He Never Got Enough Love,Lucinda Williams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lucindawilliams/henevergotenoughlove.html,"His mama ran off when he was just a kid
So he never really knew her at all
Just a picture of a girl in a sad blue dress
Hanging beside a cross on the wall
His daddy used to drive those eighteen wheelers
Now he drives the bottle deep into the night
He was always saying son, you're just no good
You'll never do anything right
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
The screams and the bruises and the broken bottles
These were things he understood
From busted chairs to a broken heart
He got away as soon as he could
When he was just eighteen he got his very own gun
Shot a kid near a liquor store one night
He was all mixed up he never understood why
He was only lookin' to prove his daddy right
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love",1992,sad
I'd Be Better Off in a Pinebox,Doug Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dougstone/idbebetteroffinapinebox.html,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Girl I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back from Georgia

Then Again,Alabama,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alabama/thenagain.html,"We could walk away now, call it over and done
Say we fought the good fight and nobody won
Say we're both better off that worst came to worst
So we didn't last, hey, we're not the first

But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die 
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
And find the love we had back then again

Off to such a good start but somehow it seems
We've let our hearts fall apart at the dreams
We could throw in the towel walk away with our pride
Say it just wasn't worth all the tears that we've cried

But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die 
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again

Maybe if we want it bad enough
We can make it better than it ever was
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again...",,sad
The Little Girl,John Michael Montgomery,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmichaelmontgomery/thelittlegirl.html,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name
Never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off
Cause He was there in my old house
And held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died",2000,sad

""Don't worry boy it will be all right""

Cause I took this walk you're walking now
Boy, I've been in your shoes
You can't hold back the hands of time
It's just something you've got to do
So dry your eyes I understand just what you're going through
Cause I took this same walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes

Down our long dusty driveway
I set my mind to go
I was eighteen and wild and free and wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked at the world and at his grown man and said,
""Don't worry boy it will be all right""

Down our long dusty driveway
This time we both would go
He had grown old and gray
And his mind was wandering
Daddy took me by the hand
Said, ""I know where we're going and I understand
Don't worry boy it will be all right""

I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...

...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh (uh, oh)
The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

Châtelet Les Halles,Florent Pagny,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florentpagny/chteletleshalles.html,"Entre gris et graffitis oÃ¹ s'enferme le quotidien
Et des murs tellement petits qu'on entend tout des voisins
Avec pour seul vis-Ã -vis des montagnes de parpaings
OÃ¹ dÃ©ambule l'ennui et se traÃ®nent des destins
Le samedi aprÃ¨s-midi, prendre des souterrains
Aller voir oÃ¹ Ã§a vit de l'autre cÃ´tÃ©, ligne un

ChÃ¢telet, ChÃ¢telet les Halles
Station balnÃ©aire mais oÃ¹ y'a pas la mer
Comme de banlieue la plage
Voir un peu de bleu, Ã©chouer sa galÃ¨re
Marquer son passage, suivre les tags quand y'a plus de repÃ¨res
ChÃ¢telet, la fin du voyage

C'est pas ici Tahiti mais c'est toujours mieux que rien
Les baskets sur le parvis ne vont jamais trÃ¨s loin
On y piÃ©tine les dÃ©bris et les abris clandestins
Ãprouvant mÃªme du mÃ©pris Ã  ceux qui tendent la main
De Harlem Ã  Paris, s'engouffrer dans un train
Puis un couloir qu'on suit, ne pas aller plus loin, ligne un

How Could You,Mario,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mario/howcouldyou.html,"[Verse:]
It's kinda crazy baby,
How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly,
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now u cant even remember mine)

[Hook:]
U made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me),
(Love made me blind, baby) but now I see,
(you had things up your sleeve, dont even lie to me) I even heard it from your family,

[Chorus:]
How could you let somebody lay where I layed?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could You How Could You just forget about me?
How Could You teach him all the things I taught You?
How Could You put him up to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How Could You put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How Could You How Could You just forget about me?

[Verse:]
You must be out ya mind,
You got alot of nerve (to think that im gone chill after all the shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for ya,
(I kno ur sick about) the way I found you out,
(GO head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house,
You should have thought of me b4 you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I cant believe that u did this to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Girl I tried to give u everything,
Can't believe the ways u repaid me,
Girl u had it all,
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you,
Baby I've accepted it,
And I aint gone trip,
Girl im movin on,
Sometimes I cant help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me

[Chorus]

How could you let somebody lay where I layed?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, How could you just forget about me?

How could you put him up to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??",2004,sad
Breaks My Heart,Monica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monica/breaksmyheart.html,"[Verse 1]
When I think of what I've done
All the pain that I brung
Baby you should've walked out on me
And when I turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me
And it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should've been mad at you

[Chorus]
Baby it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe
After everything you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just being your girl

[Verse 2]
Never gave you my heart
Cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt
When deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need
And I always gave you up
Whenever I thought something better comes along
And right when I come back
You're waiting for me
And you welcomed me home.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if it takes my whole life
I'll make it up to you
Cause I've been so cruel
You've given your love to me
In spite of everything
I don't deserve you
From this day forward
I'm truly yours
and it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for lovin' me

I Will,Chris de Burgh,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chrisdeburgh/iwill.html,"I'm going to an island,
Where the sun will always shine,
Where the moon is always riding on the sea;
And when I go I'll leave behind,
These chains that hold me down,
The time has come to set my spirit free,
Ah ah ... I will

And there beside a mountain stream,
I'll build a house of stone,
And work the wood of cedar, pine and fir,
And then I'll make a garden,
And I'll plant a field of corn,
Press my hands deep into Mother Earth,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Yes I will,
Oh I will,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
I want to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will...  And then I'll teach my children love,
Like every father should,
For we are part of every living thing,
And speak of half-forgotten words,
Like peace and joy and good,
For the world can only live when love can sing,
Ah, ah ... I will,
Oh, yes I will,
I will,
And they will be a part of Nature once again,
Oh they will feel a part of Nature once again,
The time is now,
Just to be a part of Nature once again,
And I will, ah ah, someday I will, (someday I will)",1977,sad

Tom Drunk,Ky-Mani Marley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kymanimarley/tomdrunk.html,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Let me tell you of a story
'Bout a creature I once knew
Had a wife that was a teacher
And the daughter was it too

He was loved among his neighbors
For the wonders works he's done
For the building of the new church
And the work for rodness funds

But things change and times got rough
And his wife is acting strange
And the friends Tom once knew so well
Just don't seems the same

Now Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Now instead of getting better
Things started to get worse
When they dropped off from the ministry
And burnt down Tom's new church

After all the things that Tom had done
It seems like no one care
Now Tom is sitting all alone
Shedding lonely tears

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Oh, oh, no, yeah
Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

To much stress, can't bare the pressure
So he sips the Devil's water
Reach at home, he rapes his wife
Then he turns and beats his daughter

Can't believe [?]
Then he slowly caught the hammer
Put the fist into his hand
Then he bowed and said the prayer

Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone, Tom is gone
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone Tom is gone

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
Played a fool
Tom is drunk now

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
He lost his crew now

Tom drunk

Do You Believe In Loneliness,Marc Anthony,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marcanthony/doyoubelieveinloneliness.html,"I used to try
To set aside
Some Time for being lonely

So many times 
I prayed to find
Someone like you to hold me

All I know is that when I think of you
I'm not alone
I just simply close me eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

[Chrous:]
Do you believe in loneliness
I do now that's where I found you and I'll never let you go
When all I knew was onlyness
There you were
With you around
Who's lonely now

I feared the night
But now it's mine
'Cause something's out there for me

Let's take our time
I'm satisfied
With having you to own me

All I know is that when I think of you I'm not alone
I just simply close my eyes
And sing my song
And I am home
Loving where I belong

Bet my friends been telling you

'Cause I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest

I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

Only half a blue sky

Hallelujah,Kate Voegele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katevoegele/hallelujah.html,"Well I've heard there was a sacred chord
David played and pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Oh baby I have been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind),Dru Hill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/druhill/thelovewehadstaysonmymind.html,"[Spoken:]
I just can't believe it, girl 
I can't believe that it's over 
But I'm your man, and I'll be alright 
But still, the love we had 
Stays on my mind 

Lately baby, I've been thinking 
How good it was when you were here 
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking 
For once I feel my head is clear 

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes 
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise 
I guess you meant more to me than I realized 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 

And lately girl, I've been remembering 
The good times that we used to share 
My thoughts of you don't have an ending 
And memories of you are everywhere 

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern 
You win some, you lose some 
Well I've lost and I've learned 
Sisqo's so lonely 
With no place to turn 
And here at the end, I find 
Yes I do 

The love we had stays on my mind 
Girl, if you were nearer 
If you had a mirror 
Maybe you could count my tears 

And if you were nearer 
It would all be clearer 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish, how I wish 
How I wish that you were here 

And baby girl I was tired 
So I laid down to dream for a little while 
But lately I've been so, so uninspired 
Without the comfort of your smile 

But I'm not complaining 
Cuz that's how it goes 
There's always some heartache 
In this world I suppose 
But you can't imagine 
But nobody knows 

The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind

I wanna heal cracks in the sidewalk and keep it alive 
Sat down on the ground and i laid my head down to see 
I closed up my eyes as the numbers went by 
And that's when i started this dream 

Son you're still young but your mind has grown old it 
Seems 
Now go tell your sister to show me her new magazines 

Said man sit for a while 
Son he said son how you've only begun on the mile 

I've been to the moon and the stars and the go 
Inbetweens 
Go tell your sis to stop playing with new machines 

Tell them to keep things quiet 

Man stay here a while 
Son he said son how you've only begun on the mile...",P:  ,sad

Dark Turn of Mind,Gillian Welch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gillianwelch/darkturnofmind.html,"Take me and love me if you want me
Don't ever treat me unkind
'Cause I had that trouble already
And it left me with a dark turn of mind

Now I see the bones in the river
And I feel the wind through the pine
And I hear the shadows a-calling
To a girl with a dark turn of mind

But oh ain't the nighttime so lovely to see?
Don't all the nightbirds sing sweetly?
You'll never know how happy I'll be
When the sun's going down

And leave me if I'm feeling too lonely
Full as the fruit on the vine
You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some have a dark turn of mind

You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some girls are blessed with a dark turn of mind",2011,sad

We had our shot and missed it by a mile
Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then
Do you remember when

We sang, we laughed

They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in

No they can't fill your space

Now that you're gone I'm holdin' on

You know the ones you wore the day
That you were taken away from me
I just began to stop wearing my ring
And I finally stop playin' our song
Whe I realizied I was dancin' alone and
Finally God gave me strength
To go on and breath again

Hello Alone,Anberlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anberlin/helloalone.html,"Is this where the interstate ends?
In coastal towns like this

In the places left unknown
If hope could only find me out

Is this the end of everything we've known? (We've known)
This is the end of everything I am

Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there?
Alone! Alone!
Cause the coldest winters thrive

Depression is the unholy ghost
In the coastal towns of ahead
Though I know a thousand names
I see my only friend
I've got the gun
All I need is ten cents for the bullet
I feel helpless, sleeping at best, waiting for your return
Are you ever coming home?

Is anybody out there?
Hello! Hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there?
Alone! Alone!
Cause the coldest winters thrive on broken homes

Does anybody (Does anybody)
Do they ever listen? (Do they ever listen?)

My heart had crashed and burned in shame
You pulled me from the flames
I took your hand and you helped me upon my feet
I confessed but you had forgiven me
There's courage in the truth you said
Our love will never end
You shield me from danger, you're my shelter 
You are my hiding place

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a Guardian Angel
Sent for me

My dream comes between us every now and then
I make mistakes, get in trouble, time and again
I ain't proud of who I am
When I'm down you understand
Blinded you can always seem to show the way 
You're the light You're the reason I'm here today
If you cry, I cry, So dry your eyes

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home

Pretty Girl at the Airport,The Avett Brothers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avettbrothers/prettygirlattheairport.html,"Wish me luck I know you think I'll need it
For all the hardest roads we have to walk alone
And you don't have to tell me that you love me
For all the words I've never understood
I know, I know

The wind that blows from here to California
Never stops to turn and wonder why it goes
And you don't have to tell me when you're leaving
For all the plans I've never understood
I know, I know

Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know

To have your things and wait there for a plane ride
No one there to sit and hold your hand in flight
But everyone I know out here is lonely
Even those that have someone to lie beside at night

Leave me with the dawn
It's almost gone
I know, I know
Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know",2004,sad
Four Become One,Hawthorne Heights,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hawthorneheights/fourbecomeone.html,"And you will live on
Our hearts will beat stronger
As we remain as one
We will last just a little while longer

And as we pull ourselves together
We can't help, but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

Now the time has come now
And we must figure out
Driving north or going south
Growing up or falling down

And as we pull ourselves together
We can't help, but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start

When five becomes four
And four becomes one
You're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
You made us laugh
We only cried, but once
You made us laugh
In photographs, on display for everyone

Driving north or going south
Growing up or falling down",2008,sad
Goodbye Kiss,Kasabian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/goodbyekiss.html,"Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock'n Roll sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again",2011,sad
Where Did You Go?,MxPx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mxpx/wheredidyougo.html,"I dream that someday I will find you
The blue skies turn to rain
And they're never coming back again
I've got your picture in my mind here
You're the one that got away
I was begging you to stay with me

Where did you go I just don't know?
My life is scattered in the wind
I'm trying to begin again
Where did you go I just don't know?
I don't wanna cry myself to sleep again
I don't wanna wake up all alone again

I've never been dealt a hand like this
With face cards running dry
And rain falling from the sky
What could have been if you had stayed
Broken dreams would mend
You'd be sitting in the summer wind with me

But all I've got are memories
And dreams of how my life could be
Dreams of how my life could be.",2006,sad
All I Want Is You,Julie Roberts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julieroberts/alliwantisyou.html,"What I need is medication
In the form of a vacation
What I need is skies of blue

What I need is a perspective
One that's healthy but objective
What I need is a point of view
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

What I need is bread and water
And a father for our daughter
What I need is someone new
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

To forget when you were with me

All I want
Is you",2006,sad

Every word I cut you down is playing in my head
Like a scar face crime scene ain't no bringing it back
Those tears didn't mean much to bun now I know
That you said you didn't feel it to the wind starts to get cold

[Chorus:]
Only she's the woman like the car I replaced it
No sleep I wonder if she saw this bullet coming like this
Only words that I can hear in my ear is the gesture your gon' the seeds
You planted in the fields
Baby where you at when you sitting on my pillow case no more
Baby where you at I just recognized I'm living life alone
Baby where you at I just wish just wish you'd call me
Damn this phone baby where you at
Doc said I only got four weeks my whole life just flashed before me

Oh, oh, ohhhaaa (how foolish could I be)
Wild as can be
Never (never) fear be humble (humble)
Got me out to face my fate
May never have a choice to be honest (honest) with the one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of taken you off that stage

Yea Papoose, Pap, Papoose
They say you never know what you have till you lose it
You promise your girl something you better do it
You can't tell a woman you love her are you stupid
Words don't express you love you got to prove it
Back then our relationship wasn't the truest
Grown man slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on I become foolish
Now your gone everything ruined
But girl this is Papoose I'm on your favorite track
I know your friends are in your ear
But baby come back and I never let you down so later for that
I told you I was gonna make it I was the savior of rap
And I work hard you don't got to cater to Pap
I tie my own do-rag
Lay back and relax
You don't even got to accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it acknowledge me

Awhooo babe
If anyone up in here wasn't just like me
Awhooo babe
Treat her like this wasn't last week
Wont you call babe (wont you call)
No this song babe
Girl you know this song is hearing me
Damn I regret when I almost pass me

If I Were You,Tamia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tamia/ifiwereyou.html,"I look in the mirror, with you in my arms
And I see a reflection
Of a smile that says you believe in love
And just for a moment, I drifted away
But I couldn't stay cuz
A hint of love, a bit of fear
I'm tryin' to say

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
Ooh yeah

I'm tryin' to protect you
From the lies that your heart tells
Even though it says that you love me
All I see is pain and misery
Seasons may change
But I can't forget the days of old
My heart ached when you walked away
I said I'd never love again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Cuz I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here

The days go by
And I feel that you could make me happy
Time goes on
And I feel that love is at my door
And though I tell myself that you're the one
Who said those words before
Thought it hurts too much
I can't trust in love
Again
Again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here

Can't be here

My Road,Jorn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jorn/myroad.html,"Empty was the cradle before I learned to walk
I crawled to find out where the song played
The music and the melody were captured by the heart
And so my road to light and darkness had begun

The dream inside the vision fueled within my mind
Has guided me to some where in between
Wandering the twilight in a circle of fire
Sent here to burn in this wheel of yearning
As I'm turning

The promised land is hidden beyond this life and time
But somewhere in the distance hides the sun
Brave into a new world we stumble to the fall
Into after all
I can feel death call",2012,sad

Sad it has to be like that
It ain't working out baby in another life or space

And it's really weighing heavy on me baby

Make You Feel My Love,Ronan Keating,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ronankeating/makeyoufeelmylove.html,"When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love",2009,sad
Gave It All Away,Boyzone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boyzone/gaveitallaway.html,"I ... I will learn to live before I die
Will learn to love and learn to try

The one that's meant for me
Or for the man that I used to be (used to be)
Til' I gave it all away (gave it all away [x2])

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

About yourself but about me too (about me too)

What could I do

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

Some people wait a lifetime for a chance like this
I've waited enough
Baby, no, I won't let you go

A Waste of Space,Dayshell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dayshell/awasteofspace.html,"Today the presence's over, awake the dead for closure
Believing in true, I love you

A waste of space is cliche,
The thought of endless betraying me like a fool,
So who needs you.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

Tonight my love is unsafe,
I'm left with doubts and mistakes,
Collapsing into the bottle of you.
If I could rewind and go back,
I'd destroy the place that we first me at.
And I just might.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
And I know, you've done this before.

You took the best of me, the best of me.

Lay me down, On the sea,
You're the crook side of criminal that hardly can breathe
Don't you see me now, I'm on my knees,
You say I'm invincible, but they all seen me bleed
And I know, you've done this before",2013,sad
Angel,Jamey Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jameyjohnson/angel.html,"The voice on the telephone sounds awful angry
And somehow it doesn't fit in
With the face in the picture I keep on my dresser
Of the girl I once called my best friend

We drank from the fountain of good times and dreaming
But these lawyers have poisoned the well
And as our love is dying they're making a killing
On heartaches and furniture sales

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?

Am I right or is she right or are we both wrong?
Or is it even about that at all?
As Heaven is fading we're fighting and fussing
And the devil's just having a ball.

And the line between evil and good disappears
And now it's so hard to tell
Am I shaking a demon that's after my soul
Or sending an angel to Hell?",2008,sad
I Who Have Nothing,Joe Cocker,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joecocker/iwhohavenothing.html,"I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but, oh
I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you

He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when, darling, it's I
Who loves you

I love you
I love you
I love you",2004,sad

helped beat her cancer, made sure she got well

I only tried to kiss ya

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do

As I step into my womanhood

Shortly after midnight
She turned off the porch light
Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wonderin' if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman to
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood
One more time

You heard, yes I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do

Underneath Your Clothes,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/underneathyourclothes.html,"You're a song 
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong cause 
This might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve

I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over 
We will still belong to each other

There's my territory

Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true 
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey [x2]",2001,sad
Lips Of An Angel,Hinder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hinder/lipsofanangel.html,"Honey why you calling me so late?
It's kinda hard to talk right now.
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue

Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak

Speechless,The Veronicas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/veronicas/speechless.html,"Feels like I have always known you
And I swear I've dreamt about you
All those endless nights I was alone
It's like I've spent forever searching
Now I know that it was worth it
With you it feels like I am finally home

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

Cuz you leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
Can't help but surrender
My everything to you

I thought I could resist you
I thought that I was strong
Somehow you were different from what I've known
I didn't see you coming
You took me by surprise and
You stole my heart before I could say no

Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

You leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender
Oh no
My everything to you

You leave me speechless
(the way you smile, the way you touch my face)
You leave me breathless
(it's something that you do I can't explain)
I'd run a million miles just to hear you say my name,
Baby

You leave me speechless
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through

My everything to you",2005,sad

Like waves, like the sea 
They pull out of here

Rode a horse around the world 
Along the tracks of a train 
Broke the record, found the gold 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear

Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea 
On the tracks of a train 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear",2000,sad
Welcome to My Life,Simple Plan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simpleplan/welcometomylife.html,"Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you're screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like


To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

And always give more than you take

Just tryin' to think of something to do
Tryin' to think of something, anything
Just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know it's not working out
'cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

I'm sittin' here tryin' to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back

I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight

I'm sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone it's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
We've got nothing left to prove

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back, but I know you did

And I didn't mean to meet you then
We were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
But you did",2002,sad
Poem to a Horse,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/poemtoahorse.html,"You're to far to bring you close
And too high to see below
just hangin' on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
You start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

[Chorus:]
I'll leave again 
Cuz I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'd rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
Cuz to talk to you is harder work 
So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
Cuz there's a foot for every shoe 
I wish you luck but I've got other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've
Been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more",2001,sad
Without A Kiss,Badly Drawn Boy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/badlydrawnboy/withoutakiss.html,"All the songs have been sung
Youâre too old and then youâre too young

One as deep as true love
Letâs sing Hosanna

All the stories are told
Youâre too young and then youâre too old
Did you leave a mark on the world
One that lasts as long as true love
Take me with you now

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
And someone you saw again
Back to haunt you there and then
Please take on my love

Evolution is real
Secrets we have never revealed
Did you leave your mark, was it real
Or as deep as the love we both feel

To be strung as high as this
Making love without a kiss
Like a gift you didnât keep
And it leaves a mark so deep

Thereâs a million things to miss
Like the chance to take that kiss
where you go, youâll be someone
With one kiss your life is swung

What you gonna do when you walk away
Walk behind me, itâs alright, Iâm Ok
Then what will you do if I walk away
Walk beside me, itâs alright, weâre Ok
Where you gonna do, donât surrender
Hold me tight, donât let go",2006,sad

If I was a telephone you'd ring me all day long
If was in pain I know you'd sing me soothing songs

Sometimes I believe in fate

Always seem to ring more true
You took a chance on loving me
I took a chance on loving you

in a world created for only us
an empty cage that has no key

carving out of jealousy
Crawling into each other it's smothering
every little part of me
What kind of love is this that keeps me
hanging on
despite everything it's doing to me
what is this love that keeps me coming
back for more
when it will only end in misery
I know too many people unhappy
in a life from which they'd love to flee
watching others get everything offered
they're wanton for discovery
Oh my brother my sister my mother
you're loosing your identity
can't you see that it's you in the window
shining with intensity
What kind of love is this that keeps me
hanging on
despite everything it's doing to me
what is this love that keeps me coming

And when the lights go down
That is where I'll be found

This music's irresistible
Your voice makes my skin crawl
Innocent and pure
I guess you heard it all before

Mister Inaccessible
Will this ever change
One thing that remains the same
You're still a picture in a frame

Lost in this world
I even get lost in this song

Over You,Daughtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daughtry/overyou.html,"Now that it's all said and done,
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down,
Like an old abandoned house.
What you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath.
I fell too far, was in way too deep.
Guess I let you get the best of me.

Well, I never saw it coming.
I should've started running
A long, long time ago.
And I never thought I'd doubt you,
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know.
I'm slowly getting closure.
I guess it's really over.
I'm finally getting better.
And now I'm picking up the pieces.
I'm spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together.
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through,
I got over you.

You took a hammer to these walls,
Dragged the memories down the hall,
Packed your bags and walked away.
There was nothing I could say.
And when you slammed the front door shut,
A lot of others opened up,
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me.

Well, I never saw it coming.
I should've started running
A long, long time ago.
And I never thought I'd doubt you,
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know.

I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know.
I'm slowly getting closure.
I guess it's really over.
I'm finally getting better.
And now I'm picking up the pieces.
I'm spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together.
Well I'm putting my heart back together,
'Cause I got over you.
Well I got over you.
I got over you.
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through,
I got over you.",2006,sad

Flat on the Floor,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/flatonthefloor.html,"Not like I need to depend upon anyone

5 minutes your description might be starting to fit
3 to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known

Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all

Black Hole,Lindsay Lohan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lindsaylohan/blackhole.html,"I found that box of letters
Lying on the ground
The ones you used to write me before it all went down
I even got a papercut trying to figure out
What to do with all these memories
And you're not who you used to be
And I wonder where your gone

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love? [2x]

Remember all those hours laughing on the floor
Those days of doing nothing fell like nothing did before
I don't need those sneakers or that money after all
I'll trade them for old message you've called

'Cause it's not how we used to feel
And I wonder what went wrong

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we felt so much?
Where's the love?
I wanna go there, and I wanna know where
Everything that meant something to me is all

I found that box of letters, used to make me smile
But now I feel so lonely

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where had so much?
A black hole
Somewhere there's a univere of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love? [5x]

What a wicked thing to say, never felt that way

There's A Place For Us,Phil Collins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/philcollins/theresaplaceforus.html,"'...There's a place for us, somewhere a time and a place.' 

So here we are together
just you and me
sitting side by side
don't know why
with time just racing by
but I don't want to go

Well I don't know much about it
'cos all I am is what you see
in front of you
there's no more
feels so close and yet so far
but I don't want to go

Here I am, take my hand
here I am, please take my hand

I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright
if you don't mind I could sit and stare all night
sit here waiting for you to hold me tight

It's sad but I know it's true
you see I know you well
you'd only laugh at me
and that would hurt me so
just look at me here
you've got me pleading with you
but i don't want to go

'Cos you know that I love you so
yes you know that I love you so

Here. I will be here love
for you love, I will always be here love

If you look real close
you'll see my heart is on my sleeve
and it'll be here waiting
waiting for you, waiting for me
someone once said that if you truly, truly believe
you can make things happen
make things appear to be all that they seem
tell me do you believe?

We'll find a hideaway
together we'll find a way
somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way
there must be somewhere
there must be someplace
we can find somewhere
where they don't know my face
believe me we can find it
yes we can find it
somewhere, there's a place for us
somewhere, a time and a place for us
somewhere
we fly so close",1993,sad
The Suburbs,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/thesuburbs.html,"In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screamin'
We're still screamin'
We're still screamin'",2010,sad
Love Is Blindness,Jack White,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackwhite/loveisblindness.html,"One, two, three
Two, two, three

Love is blindness,
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness.

I'm in a parked car
On a crowded street,
And I see my love
Made complete.
The thread is ripping
The knot is slipping.
Love is blindness.

Love is clockworks,
And it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Blindness

Love is blindness
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness

A little death
Without mourning
No call
No Warning
Baby, a dangerous idea...
Almost makes...sense

Love is drowning
In a deep well
All the secrets
And no body else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey
Blindness

Love is blindness,
I'm so sick of it,
I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
And wrap it all around me, now
Oh my love
Blindness

Oh, I'm too numb to feel...
Blow out the candle.
Blindness.",,sad

At Night, When You're Far And I'm Alone
I Feel The Fabric From Your T-Shirt
Flow With My Body
I Can Still Hear Your Baritone
In My Ear Telling Me You'll Take It Slow
And I Was In The Mirror Playing A Role
Like You Were Here, I Couldn't Turn Me On
So I Fell Asleep With The Music On
Woke Up Again Hearing The Same Old Song, Playing

(Oh) Giving Me The Fever
(Oh) Now You Got My Feet Up
This One Is A Keeper
Now The Second Verse Is Playing

(Oh) Hold Me While My Hands Up
(Oh) And The Music Picks Up
Now He Sees My Shirt Off
I'm Thinking To Myself Again

When You're Not Here (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
I Wish You Were Here (To Take Off Your T-Shirt)
After We Make Love (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
Wake Up In Your T-Shirt,
To smell The Scent Of Your Cologne
When I Need Your Feel (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)
I Need Help (To Take Off Your T-Shirt)
After We Make Love (I Sleep In Your T-Shirt)

Then We'll Be Making Love And Hearing The Song Again

Let me be weak,
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep.

To any sound of engines,
Ev'ry gull a seeking craft.
I can't keep my eyes open--
Wish I had my radio.

I tune in to some friendly voices
Talking 'bout stupid things.
I can't be left to my imagination.

Let me be weak,
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep.

And they smell like sleep,
And they say they take me home.

They take me deeper and deeper.",1985,sad

Real Men,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/realmen.html,"Take your mind back - I don't know when
Sometime when it always seemed
To be just us and them
Girls that wore pink
And boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men
Than me and you
What's a man now - what's a man mean
Is he rough or is he rugged
Is he cultural and clean
Now it's all change - it's got to change more
'Cause we think it's getting better
But nobody's really sure
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
See the nice boys - dancing in pairs
Golden earring golden tan
Blow-wave in the hair
Sure they're all straight - straight as a line
All the gays are macho
Can't you see their leather shine
You don't want to sound dumb - don't want to offend
So don't call me a faggot
Not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall and handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are
Time to get scared - time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady
Don't know how to be a man
Time to admit - what you call defeat
'Cause there's women running past you now
And you just drag your feet
Man makes a gun - man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink
And man can take a whore
Kill all the blacks - kill all the reds
And if there's war between the sexes
Then there'll be no people left
And so it goes - go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are",2001,sad

Not About Love,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/notaboutlove.html,"The early cars
Already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work
In holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag
And the bind
And the ammunition round

Conversation once colored by esteem
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation, my palate got clean
Now I could taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag
And the bind
And the ammunition round

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I can't stop falling out

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

What is this posture
I have to stare at
That's what he said when I'm sittin' up straight
Change the name of the game 'cause he lost
And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I've said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels
Step out of this sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact I cant stop falling out

This is not about love

In fact I cant stop falling out

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

You know it's just too little too late
I can't wait, no, no, no

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway

Time and Time Again,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/timeandtimeagain.html,"Yes I did it and I'll do it again 
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
I don't think so 
You're not that smart 
Over and over it breaks my heart 
The cycle continues time for your crime 
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
Her makeup smears 
The tears that she cries 
Over and over every night 

Emotional swords slash my soul 
And now the pain takes control 
I think about you 
I think about me 
Think about the way that it used to be 
I need a bottle 
I need some pills 
I need a friend 
I need some thrills 
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
When life gets rough 

Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 

It's like a fight every single day 
It's always easy when you have it your way 
Deep in my heart 
In the depths of my soul 
My selfish ways are out of control 
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
The makeup smears 
Tears that we cry 
Over and over every night 

You're so selfish 
You're making me want to end this relationship 
You're making me want to end this 

Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind 
Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind",2002,sad
Singular Indestructible Droid,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/singularindestructibledroid.html,"Blood of my blood 
Skin of my skin 
A normal human being 
Solder and wires 
Circuitry 
We're far from human beings 

He's sick of his skin 
It's time to trade it in 
A galaxy of emotions 
Your soul is what it costs 
We walk the same path 
No body could get in our way 
Dangerously 
We passionately never hesitate 

Keep the soul 
That's control 
Now you put in the metal 

Biological 
Spiritual 
Electrical 
Digital 
S.I.D. 

Willing to make the change 
Surrender the flesh and bones 
Against the grain 
Pushing beyond the limits of ourselves 
This body is just a cage 
You're dead and you're in a grave 
We're losing our minds 
That's just fine 
Living forever 

Bleed out my blood 
Skin off my skin 
Solder the wire 
Transformation 
Take my body and 
Release me from this cage 
You can't put a spirit in a grave

He Wasn't,Avril Lavigne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avrillavigne/hewasnt.html,"There's not much going on today.
I'm really bored, it's getting late.
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate.

Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

This is when I start to bite my nails.
And clean my room when all else fails.
I think it's time for me to bail.
This point of view is getting stale.

Sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

We've all got choices.
We've all got voices.
Stand up make some noise.
Stand up make some noise.

Sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.

Island,Heather Nova,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heathernova/island.html,"There are parts of me he'll never know, my wild horses and my river beds, and in my throat voices he'll never hear.
He pulls at me like a cherry tree, and I can still move but I don't speak about it.
Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead. He's to scared to hit me now - he'll bring flowers istead

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere to go

And the dogwoods shimmer in October sun, ""oh sweet thing"", he sings to me,
""You're the only one.""

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you, 
Somewhere to go.

And I don't know why I can't tell my sister, He spat in my face again, and I don't want to die here. You know that dream when your feet won't move, you want to come but your body won't let you. He steals it from me.He steals it from me. It shines like sweat, like jewels, like something that has died to soon. He fucks with the beauty. A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick, a kiss kiss kick. He steals it from me. It's out of my hands again.

I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you,
Somewhere to go, to go.....",1994,sad

Strong Enough,Stacie Orrico,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stacieorrico/strongenough.html,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there anyway to be made whole again?
If I'm healed,renewed, and find forgiveness find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and it turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I've finally found

That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh Thank You for my chance to start again",2003,sad

Loves me when I'm lonely and thinks of me first 
Blue is the color of night 
When the red sun 
Disappears from the sky 
Raven feathers shiny and black 
A touch of blue glistening down her back 
We don't talk about heaven and we don't talk about hell
We come to depend on one another so damn well
So go to confession whatever gets you through
You can count your blessings I'll just count on blue

Ends,Everlast,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everlast/ends.html,"Everything must change...
Ends...

[Chorus:]
Some people would rob their mother for the ends
Rat snitch on one another for the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered for the ends
So before we go any further I want my ends

I knew this cat named Dale
Who didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material
Ivy League scholar
Had a PHD
An MBA
But now he's waitin' tables 'cause there's rent to pay
Company's down sizin'
Inflation's risin'
Can't find a job
He's feelin' kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he's been blessed
So he falls off track
Starts smokin' the crack
And once it hits his brain
It starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back
The shoes off his feet
He's losin' all his teeth
Now he's out on the street
And all of the sudden he's like Jesse James
Tryin' to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school
And he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew this chick named Sally
She had a nice strut
And everywhere that I went she was up in the cut
Swingin' that butt like ""place your ad here""
Only rapped the Benz
And rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearin'Champagne wavin'
Jewels around the neck
A lotta style she's cravin'
Ain't no savin'
She's doin' all the spendin'
If you do the lendin'
She'll do the bendin'
Straight machine vendin'
That's money for tail
Shoppin' sprees get her on her knees
And then you hit her with the keys of your krib you actin' funny
Come home one day find her countin' out your money
From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo
If you broke she's spittin'
If you're rich she might swallow
For the ends

[Chorus]

I knew these two homeboys
That made a lot of noise
Makin' money on the block
The kids was on their jock
They was tougher than leather
Like Reverend Run
DMC they was totin' guns
Holdin' weight
Goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips
And pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and clothes
And got no job
And then one disappeared
And one got robbed
For the ends

The World You Love,Jimmy Eat World,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmyeatworld/theworldyoulove.html,"I got a story it's almost finished
all i need is someone to tell it too
maybe, that's you.

our time is borrowed and spent to freely
every minute i have needs to be made up
but how?
i'm looking for a nice way to say
""i'm out.""
i want out.

i fall asleep with my friends around me
only place i know, i feel safe
i'm gonna call this home

the open road is still miles away
Hey nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

Windows open and close
that's just how it goes

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

i'm in love with the ordinary
i need a simple space
and rest my head
everything gets clear
well i'm a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps 
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it (over it)

it might seem like a dream
but it's real to me

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesn't seem theres hope for me
i let you down
but i won't give in now
not for any amount

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are",2004,sad
Less Is More,Joss Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jossstone/lessismore.html,"Don't go sending me those three dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do
Don't go trying to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm making money too

Don't go throwing those stones outside my window
You don't gotta be calling three times a day
'Cause if you do then when we get together
I'll be biting my lip 'cause there's nothing else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]
Less is more
Back it up slow it down let it breathe
Cause you too much of a good thing can be
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember

If you wanna be showing your affection
Don't you know a simple kiss will do
So many beautiful ways for love's expression
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't getting through

Haven't you heard a little space makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out its not right

[Chorus]

It would be something if I had a chance to be missing you
Too much for taking it's driving me crazy
That's all you do
It needs rearranging
It's so suffocating
That I can't move
You gotta take two steps back
Believe what they say
It's true

[Chorus]

Gimme a chance to miss you
Boy I don't mean to diss you, but 
I tell you I need some space and still you call me up three times a day
You know, baby you crowding me out
Haven't you heard less is more

Name,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/name.html,"And even though the moment passed me by 
I still can't turn away 
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
Got tossed along the way 
And letters that you never meant to send 
Got lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans 
And never knew their names 
We don't belong to no one 
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me 
Maybe for a while 
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far 
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast 
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history 
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name 
I won't tell em' your name 
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I won't tell em' your name

The Perfect Ending,Straylight Run,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/straylightrun/theperfectending.html,"Taken in context,
It's not a bad thing,
But when you start to pick it apart,
It gets so depressed,
It's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity,

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,
There are no perfect endings,

You peel back the layers
And get down to the inside,
But sometimes you loose sight,
Of what it was you were trying to find,
And it's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,

Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around?

Safe to say from here,
You're getting closer now,
We are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be

and cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have

From all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water bed
Do I seem familiar, I've crossed you in hallways

I want to be exposed, and not be afraid to fall.

And create a mood I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

That's what I'd do,
That's what I'd do,
To get through to you

I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have

Like a fairy tale where it works out in the end
Can I close my eyes have you lying here again
Then I come back down
Then I fade back in
Then I realize its just what might have been.

In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back 
Winter is coming and I need to stay warm 

The heat.....

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody knows

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know",2004,sad
Everything I'm Not,The Veronicas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/veronicas/everythingimnot.html,"Oh no
Don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you where something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
Cause your so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah all by yourself
You're all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute
Because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey don't u get it
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
she was tearing us apart

Everything I'm not",2005,sad
Long Way To Happy,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/longwaytohappy.html,"One night to you
Lasted six weeks for me
Just a bitter little pill now
Just to try to go to sleep
No more waking up to innocence
Say hello to hesitance
To everyone I meet
Thanks to you years ago
I guess I'll never know
What love means to me but oh
I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to
Keep on rolling like a stone
Cause it's gonna be a long long way to happy

Left my childhood behind
In a roll away bed
Everything was so damn simple
Now I'm losing my head
Trying to cover up the damage
And pad out all the bruises
too young to know i had it
So it didn't hurt to lose it
Didn't hurt to lose it
No but oh
I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to
Keep on rolling like a stone
Cause it's gonna be a long long way

Now I'm numb as hell and I can't feel a thing
But don't worry about regret or guilt cause I never knew your name
I just want to thank you
Thank you
From the bottom of my heart
For all the sleepless nights
And for tearing me apart yeah yeah

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to
Keep on rolling like a stone
Cause it's gonna be a long long way

It's gonna take a long time to love
It's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long, long, long, long way to happy, yeah

I Don't Want to Care,Jessica Simpson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jessicasimpson/idontwanttocare.html,"Here's another day 
Another girl left so confused 
Trying to find a way 
In the common likes of you 
But you're so undecided 
Stringing me along 
And it hurts just thinking 'bout one day your here and then your gone 

Nothing to say 
Wont hesitate 
Can't walk away from you 
You weren't there 
When I was scared 
Now all I wanna do is forget about love 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care anymore 

Trying to brace myself 
For the fall coz you didn't catch me 
Promised that you would hold me tight, be the one I need 

But I stood waiting for you to come give me a ride 
Back to what love's supposed to be; I guess that was a lie 

You and I now 
I don't how 
I could have fallen so deep 
Coz you weren't here to wipe all my tears 
Erase it from my memories 
I don't want to care 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now i care way too much 
Now this love thing i wish i never felt it before 
I dont wanna care 

Oh my precious time; now I can't get it back 
So lost and alone 
And I can't take feelin' like that 

Baby I've had enough 
I just wanna move on 
Don't wanna look back 
Coz I know I gotta be strong 

I don't wanna care about love anymore 
I don't wanna care about us 
I don't want to care about love: 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit 
But now I care way too much 
Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before 
I don't wanna care 

So I don't wanna care about love 
No I don't wanna care about us 
I don't wanna care at all anymore 
I used to only care a little bit

Lime Tree,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/limetree.html,"I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message said it's done,
It's done

When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Just come inside

But I keep going out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m. my heart is beating too loud
Too loud
Don't be so amazing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched

Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
If you don't

It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune

So I just won't be late
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took",2007,sad

Shake It Off,Mariah Carey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariahcarey/shakeitoff.html,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial life
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off

And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off

Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

[Bridge]
I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off

And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciated all the love I give

Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore,LeAnn Rimes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leannrimes/tillweaintstrangersanymore.html,"It might be hard to be lovers
But its harder to be friends
Baby pull down the covers
Its time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
Ill just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Dont you think its time we say
Some things we havent said
It aint too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why dont you look at me
Til we aint strangers anymore

Sometimes its hard to love me
Sometimes its hard to love you too
I know its hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life

With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

[Solo]

Its hard to find forgivness
When we just run out of lies
Its hard to say youre sorry
When you cant tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So lets get down to it baby
There aint no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Til we aint strangers anymore

We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers
We're not strangers anymore",2007,sad
All Cried Out,Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lisalisacultjam/allcriedout.html,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh you, all over you, ooh

Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener (why oh why)
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong? (Leavin' me all alone)

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I, I don't what to do
I'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)
(Whoa, whoa...)

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain

Forever,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/forever.html,"In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds by his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her... He'll never forgive her

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl... little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroine
In this moment I'm lonely fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs all these women
I'm never forgiven... this broken heart of mine

Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go, but my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss (one last kiss)

She'll lie in the end 
I ain't got no fight in me 
In this whole damn world 
Tell you to hold off 
You choose to hold on 
It's the one thing that I've known 

Once I put my coat on 
I'm coming out in this all wrong 
She's standing outside holding me 
Saying, 'Oh, please 
I'm in love 
I'm in love'

Girl save your soul 
Go on save your soul 
Before you're too far gone 
Before nothing can be done

The Ballad,Millencolin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/millencolin/theballad.html,"The last selection in the ballgame.
Does never get a pass.
""Not appreciated's"" just his first name.
He's the scapegoat of the class.
There are no friends to cheer him up and
no girls, no sweet romance.
It's impossible to expand,
when you never get a second chance.

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?  He's in pain and misery.

He's not going to the school-prom.
He said he had the flu.
Jumped-up excuses as he told mom.
-I'm safer here with you.
She told her son.  -Someday, they'll all be
sorry for mistreating you.
Don't be afraid my son and trust me.
-You'll be someone they will look up to.

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?
He's in pain and misery... Do you care enough to see?

Do you know, who's that guy, who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see?  He's in pain and misery.",2000,sad

Only to find that one won't give their heart to you

Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

Taking me over, I wanna show ya

My feet are stuck here, against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Don't you (mess up, mess up) I don't wanna lose you

Better off better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off better off, with out you boy

And every time, you notice me by
Holding me closely, and saying sweet things
I don't believe, that it could be
You speaking your mind and, saying the real thing

I don't regret it, and I won't think this
Was just a waste of time

If I'm better off, better off without you boy (don't just leave me hanging on)

Don't just leave me hanging on [repeat 'til end]",2007,sad
Possibility,Lykke Li,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lykkeli/possibility.html,"There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All that I had, was all I'm gonn' get.

mmmmmmm......

There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare.
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare.

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows.
Tell me when you hear my silence.
There's a possibility I wouldn't know

mmmmmmm....
mmmmmmm....

Know that when you leave,
Know that when you leave,
by blood and by me, you walk like a thief,
by blood and by me, I fall when you leave.

So tell me when you hear my heart stop.
You're the only one who knows.
Tell me when you hear my silence,
There's a possibility I wouldn't know.

So tell me when my sorrows over
You're the reason why I'm closed
Tell me when you hear me falling.
There's a possibility it wouldn't show.

mmmmmm.....
mmmmmm.....

By blood and by me, I'll fall when you leave.
By blood and by me, I'll follow your lead.

The Real Life,3 Doors Down,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/3doorsdown/thereallife.html,"I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and left those fears inside
And I wanted to be anyone else
Only to find that there was noone there but me

But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me

I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could of screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say

But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me

Thats out there somewhere
And it cant be that far away
Thats where ill find myself
And ill find my way out
Thats where ill find out

But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me",2005,sad
Judas,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/judas.html,"The only one who took you in
The only one who held your hand
Defended you against the others
Had your back on everything

You turned around betrayed your only brother

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

I didn't know, I didn't know
I couldn't see, I couldn't see
Never thought you'd forget me
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe
How you deceived, you deceived
I never thought you'd do that to me

I will never be like you
I'll never do the things you do
Selfish and lonely, what's your problem
Letting go of you and this
Is harder than I thought but I will not be poisoned by your actions

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

Haunted,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/haunted.html,"Louder, louder
The voices in my head
Whispers taunting
All the things you said
Faster the days go by and I'm still
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
Time
In the blink of an eye
You held my hand, you held me tight
Now you're gone
And I'm still crying
Shocked, broken
I'm dying inside

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Shadows linger
Only to my eye
I see you, I feel you
Don't leave my side
It's not fair
Just when I found my world
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart

I miss you, you hurt me
You left with a smile
Mistaken, your sadness
Was hiding inside
Now all that's left
Are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept
The soul behind a guise

Where are you
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Why did you go?
All these questions run through my mind
I wish I couldn't feel at all
Let me be numb
I'm starting to fall

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Where are you?
Where are you?

There For You,Flyleaf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/flyleaf/thereforyou.html,"Sometimes I'm a selfish fake
You're always a true friend
And I don't deserve you

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

Swirling shades of blue
Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry, cry

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

'Cause I hear the whispered words
In your masterpiece beautiful
You speak the unspeakable thought
I love you too

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
I wanna be there for you,

And be
Someone you can come to

It runs deeper than my bones
The love

I wanna be there for you.",2005,sad
Unbreakable,Fireflight,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fireflight/unbreakable.html,"Where are the people that accused me?
The ones who beat me down and bruised me
They hide just out of sight
Can't face me in the light
They'll return but I'll be stronger

God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

Sometimes it's hard to just keep going
But faith is moving without knowing
Can I trust what I can't see?
To reach my destiny
I want to take control but I know better

Forget the fear it's just a crutch
That tries to hold you back
And turn your dreams to dust
All you need to do is just trust

Geek Love,Nerina Pallot,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nerinapallot/geeklove.html,"In the race to get out of this place,
I am checking my face in the back of a spoon,
You're accusing, you say I'm not here, but I'm here, yes I'm here, yes,
I'm not on the moon, 
But I'm leaving so soon,
So don't presume to know shit about me,
'Cause I don't know myself from one day to the next,
And I don't pose perplexities purposely,
This isn't a game, this isn't a test.

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

Nine am to the beat of a drum,
As we drive through the canyon,
I'm feeling the hum of the engine,
My head and my heart are a-swim-will your cat be ok?
Your wife was she in?
Your wife, is she in???
'Cause I don't presume to know shit about you,
When you won't really tell me until I beg you to,
But I know that perplexity's a wonderful thing,
It's a sudden found joy, the strangeness it brings...

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.

I like that we argue,
But not everyday,
Your scent in a room,
The way that you say 'color' not 'colour'.

What colour today?
It's grey, grey, it's grey.

So hey, you, could you give it a rest?
Just take me home and get me undressed,
Put on a fire and make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.",2005,sad

And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But i would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing

On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield

Too busy to stop, too late to start

I know that you need me more than I need you

Hiding away won't make it easier
Taking you're hand, but I ask you why

Had Enough,Breaking Benjamin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/breakingbenjamin/hadenough.html,"Milk it for all it's worth.

The apple of your eye.

I've had it up to here, you know your end is near.

You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.

I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.

You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.

Hold me down (I will live again)
Pull me out (I will break it in)
Hold me down (better in the end)
Hold me down.

Will I Ever Make It Home,Ingram Hill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ingramhill/willievermakeithome.html,"I woke up from my sleep to the sound of that voice
From the words that I heard I had no choice
They told me I had to turn around
My assurance slowly faded down
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind

The plans that I had were quickly destroyed
The problem was one I couldn't avoid
They welcomed me to stay overnight
I'm too tired to complain so i just might
And I wonder

Will I ever make it home
To the place I recognize
Far from here and where I've been
And all the places that I've been shown
Will I ever make it home
Can they keep me here for good
Where I hardly know a soul
And my fear keeps going on

My weariness keeps growing inside
My patience is starting to subside
And I hope I'll be there soon
It can't be long or I'll fall through

Will I ever make it home
Will I ever leave the ground
Leave this place so far behind
Till there is no turning back
Will I ever make it home 
Get to where I wanna be
Find the ones who wait for me
To the place where I belong
Will I ever make it home",P:  ,sad

Why should I be sorry

I've had enough of you
Please forget my name
I'm runnin around on empty
Still tryin to get away
Anything to kill
The consciousness of you
Anything to end myself

I've been there, and I've done it
And now you'll know what it feels like
To always be afraid
Of everything you wanted to say

My mother lies alone on her back at night.
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep.

When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep.

The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise.
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping.

You move awfully quiet now
And I still feel you everywhere

Know you're wrong

Really hope that you will turn to me, and

Two People Fell In Love,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/twopeoplefellinlove.html,"A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
'Fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up fillin' their paper plates
They've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[1st Chorus]
There ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

Well, I recall a young man who was driftin' aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafÃ°Â³ right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lotta help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[2nd Chorus]
Baby, there ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
I'm glad your dad could not resist
Your mama's charms and you exist

Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning 
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window 
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

All these useless emotions 
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken 
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
Cos I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead

Hear the bells",1994,sad

Mmmm
Hey yea
No no
Mmm
Oh no
Hmmm

Oooh I'm so happy that I'm 
Livin' my life
I never knew what I went through
But hoped everything'd turn out right
I'm rememberin' the days that I was holdin' my head down
When people came around I always pretended to smile
But I knew
Deep in my heart
That I was slowly
Fallin apart
Some days
All I wanted
Was to hold my mother's hand
And hear her say
""Baby...
You're gonna make it""
Over and over again
So I

And I been livin' my life for quite some time
(Livin' my life)
And I'm
So glad I made it this far
(oh)
And
Nothin' gonna bring me back down
And
Nothin' gonna turn me around
(turn me around)

And I been livin' my life for quite some time
And I'm
So glad I made it this far
(so glad)
And
Nothin' gonna bring me back down
And
Nothin' gonna turn me around

Don't want nobody to think
It was easy for me
It took a while just to get down
Too many people just didn't believe
I'm remembering the sacrifices that I had to make
I would cry myself to sleep and say that it would be ok
But I knew
That if I prayed
That I would be on my way someday
Some times
All I wanted
Was to hear my father say
He would say
""Baby...
You're gonna make it
And I don't care what people say""
So I'm

And I been livin' my life for quite some time
And I'm
So glad I made it this far

Nothin' gonna bring me back down

Nothin' gonna turn me around

And
Nothin' gonna turn me around

Oh I want the world to see
Everything that's happened to me
I went from goin' out my mind
To always on time
And I am no longer a fool
Since my days are cold without you
And I'm so

Happy

Said I'm so

Bottom Feeders,For the Fallen Dreams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/forthefallendreams/bottomfeeders.html,"Why can't I stay outside today
The rain has washed away
All the thoughts I've need to say
I needed to say
I needed to say

It's times like these
I don't know where I'll be
All I know are all the lonely souls
That come to me in my dreams
All the threads and seams
That were weaved in between my sleep
We're all alone now
We're all alone now
We're all alone now
We're all alone now",2011,sad

How can I say this
Without hurting you
I wanted to let you go
With right and pretty excuse and leave you

Until you hold onto me
Standing and crying

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love
With someone else

You did not want anything
You always gave everything to me
You are happy to see me happy
You always looked upon me

But your love becomes tiring more and more
I will not make excuse, I will tell you all

I am in love with someone else
I didn't want to tell you all
You are a good person
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
Someone else

I sometimes worry
But I forget all about you
I am truly in love

At the end of beautiful love
I didn't want to tell you all
Because you will be hurt
Do not hold on to crumbling down sandcastle
Do not try any more
I am in love with
Someone else",P:  ,sad
Shelter,The xx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xx/shelter.html,"I find shelter, in this way
Under cover, hide away
Can you hear, when I say?
I have never felt this way

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Could I be, was I there?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown, whenever you leave
Please teach me gently, how to breathe

And I'll cross oceans, like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll mirror images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on

Maybe I had said, something that was wrong
Can I make it better, with the lights turned on",2009,sad
Re: Stacks,Bon Iver,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boniver/restacks.html,"This my excavation and today is Qumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun and the moon
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down
In a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He is dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me",2008,sad

Slowly walk away
To breathe again

Carry me away
I need your strength
To get me through this

Darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again

I love far better than thee

Just for a kiss or two
And with a little pen-knife held in her hand
She plugged him through and through

A little bird lit down on Henry Lee 
Come take him by his lilly-white hands
Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well
Which is more than one hundred feet

Softly stolen under our blanket skies
And rescue me from me, and all that I believe

I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too? 

Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes-and whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still
The man I'm supposed to be
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too?

Too late to turn to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
And I'm changing, changing
And if we died right now, this fool you loved somehow
Is here with you

I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Would you leave me too?",1995,sad

And the day keeps running faster,
Into the arms of night...
The stitches on the tapestry say,
""Everything in time,
Will find it's way home again,""
But I'm tired of crying...
No Second Chances
Don't knock on my door
There won't be any answer
I won't be here no more...
This house we had together
Might still be in its place
But the rest of this is much too hard to face,
There'll be No Second Chance...
Lovely moonlit hours we spent
Walking on the beach,
We'd gaze up at the stars,
I swear they were in our reach...
But time... it went on,
Minutes... they ran too fast.
Like you they were gone...
Into the past....",1997,sad

With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go

The unread book and painful look
the tv's on, the sound is down
One long pause
then you begin
oh look what the cat's brought in
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go
for this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
wants to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again
so let me go
let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
and I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow
and all the time I'm thinking, thinking

I want to be a hunter again
want to see the world alone again
to take a chance on life again

My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad
I know, let them not weep
Let them know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you

And how every tongue that gets bit always has another word to say

Cain bought a blade from some witch at the window
Abel bought a bag of weed
And even the last of the brown-eyed babies see
That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
There ain't a penthouse Christian wants the pain of the scab, but they all want the scar
How every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of love
And how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking of

Cain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop
Abel heard his papa pray
And even the last of the black-eyed babies say
That every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sell
That the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen help
There's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall
And it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after all
How God knows if Christ came back he would find us in a poker game
After finding out the drugs were all free but they won't let you out the door again",2007,sad
Dress Rehearsal Rag,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/dressrehearsalrag.html,"Four o'clock in the afternoon 
and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade? 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in? 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there; 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit; 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit; 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.",1971,sad
Half a World Away,R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/halfaworldaway.html,"This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive

My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away here
And I had sworn to go it alone, hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone 'n hold it along
Hold

Oh, this lonely deeps and holy way
Half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life spent
I've had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed
To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here
To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone hold it along
Hold

Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along 'n hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive

Wake Up,Arcade Fire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcadefire/wakeup.html,"Somethinâ filled up
my heart with nothinâ.
Someone told me not to cry.

But now that Iâm older,
my heartâs colder,
and I can see that itâs a lie.

Children, wake up.
Hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children donât grow up,
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
Weâre just a million little gods causin' rain storms,
turninâ every good thing to rust.

I guess weâll just have to adjust.

With my lightninâ bolts a glowinâ,
I can see where I am goinâ to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightninâ bolts a glowinâ,
I can see where I am goinâ.

Faith,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/faith.html,"Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time
I turn away
Lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly I see you change
Everything at once
The same
But the mountain never moves

Rape me like a child
Christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead
And old
And always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please
Say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand forever
Lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

I went away alone
With nothing left
But faith",1981,sad

And I'm tired of living in this hotel
Snow and rain falling through the sheets
In fact I'm tired of 23rd Street
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night

Maybe you just didn't read me right
The lights went out and you just didn't understand
I played your song; I got the melody all wrong
Wound your shit up like some rubber bands

And I'm tired of living in this hotel
Fire and rain blowing through the streets
In fact I'm tired of 23rd Street
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night

I feel like getting rid of all my things
Maybe just disappear into the fog
The traffic roars; my stomach screams
Like a gang of angry dogs

And I'm tired of living here in this hotel
TV and dirty magazines
And I'm just trying to get a little sleep
Strung out like some Christmas lights
Out there in the Chelsea night
Strung out like some Christmas lights

As strong as you were, tender you go.
I'm watching you breathing for the last time.

If she had wings she would fly away,
And another day God will give her some.

And someone's little girl was taken from the world tonight
Under the Stars and Stripes.

Silver starlight breaks down the night

Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe",1994,sad

A dying man in a living room
Whose shadow paces the floor
Who'll take you out in the open door

It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend

A fond farewell to a friend
He said really I just want to dance
Good and evil match perfect, it's a great romance
And I can deal with some psychic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in your kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
I'ts just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend
I see you're leaving me
And taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in-between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life

That I'm still sleeping

I can't look at you
This morning
I should probably have a sign
That says
'Leave right now or quicker'

Nothing will last for me
If I don't believe in love
Nothing is safe for me
When I don't believe in love

You have to leave

Maybe I slept peaceful
On your shoulder
Your arm warm around my side
But it's different now
It's morning
And I can't face your smile

The second that I feel
Your safe hands
Reaching out for mine
I slip away and out of sight

Nothing is wrong for me

Why do you care for me?

Tomorrow Wendy,Concrete Blonde,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/concreteblonde/tomorrowwendy.html,"It is complete, now
Two ends of time are neatly tied
A one-way street
She's walking to end of the line
And there she meets
The faces she keeps in her heart and mind

They say, ""Goodbye""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die

Underneath the chilly gray November sky
We can make believe that Kennedy is still alive
And we're shooting for the moon
And smiling Jackie's driving by

And they say, ""Good try""
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked
The first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought it would get us
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Hey, hey, good bye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Only God says, ""Jump""
So I set the time
'Cause if he ever saw her
It was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered
It was me who did his crying

Hey, hey, goodbye

Didn't feel the smallness under the stars
Once I got bars in my cradle
As a prisoner I write a letter from there

My Lord, to you, let me become what my child thinks I am
In you is the beauty of the world, of which death made me an artist

Why, tell me the reasons why
Try, still I don't understand
Will I ever feel this again
Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
Free them, free the memories of you
Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you

A day like today
My whole world has been changed
Nothing you say
Will help ease my pain

Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
Burn, burn to feel alive again
She, she'd want me to move on
See me, this place I still belong
Give chase, to find more than I have found
And face, this time now on my own

Days disappear
And my world keeps changing
I feel you here
And it keeps me sane

So I'm moving on
I'll never forget
As you lay there and watched me
Accepting the end
I knew you were scared
You were strong I was trying
I gave you my hand
I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
And I'll carry on
The best that I can without you here beside me
Let him come take you home",2002,sad
River of Tears,Eric Clapton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ericclapton/riveroftears.html,"It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away,
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today.

It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face,
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace.

Lord, how long have I got to keep on running,
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is, since you've been gone
I feel like I'm drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feel like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river.

In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace.
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face.

I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain,
But my time's run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again.

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here.
You'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears.
Drowning in a river.
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in the river.

You lie there on the swollen ground
Deserted in your heart
Still longing for what yesterdays lost
And for all that tomorrow might bring
The passion lost - taken, stolen
The dreams we had and we shared - shattered, broken
With kind words you'd come to soothe me
But I go blind and filled with fear
Would send you away from me
There is no hope in regretting now
All the pain that we could not see
We both knew what we wanted
And we took it believing it free
And we took it believing it free.",1991,sad

And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.

And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving

Fifteen blows to your mind.

So lock the kids up safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard.

Who's got the loneliest feeling.

With a single pillow underneath your single head.
I guess you decided that that old queen was more space than you would need.
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment with a sign that says it's free.

And I hope you have more luck with this than me.

You used to think that someone would come along.
And lay beside you in a space that they belong.
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new.
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

Other than a sick desire for self-abuse.

And I try not to worry, but you've got me terrified.
It's like you're in some kind of hurry to say goodbye,

You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed.
You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed.",2008,sad
Over,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/over.html,"I can't hold this day
Anymore
Understand me

To tread this fantasy, openly

I can't mould this stage
Anymore
Recognise me

To tread this fantasy, openly

Lonely Lonely,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/lonelylonely.html,"Water water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas

Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely that is you
Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue",2004,sad
Calendar Girl,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/calendargirl.html,"If I am lost for a day; try to find me
But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me
All of the things that I thought were so easy
Just got harder and harder each day
December is darkest and June is the light but this empty bedroom won't make anything right
While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me all through the night
Calendar girl who's in love with the world Stay alive
Calendar Girl who's in love with the world Stay alive
I dreamed I was dying; as I so often do
And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky
And said whoever is up there,please don't let me die
But I can't live forever,I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost
Calendar Girl who is lost to the world
Stay Alive
Calendar Girl who is lost to the world Stay Alive
January, February, March, April, May I'm alive
June, July, August, September,October I'm alive
November, December, you all through the winter, I'm alive
I'm alive",2004,sad

You don't know how much I'm hoping, how I'm hoping
Please. Oh, please let me down easy
Please just let me down easy

Can't you hear my heart is calling
You don't know how hard I've fallen for you

Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,The Smiths,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smiths/heavenknowsimmiserablenow.html,"I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job

In my life
Why do I give valuable time

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired and send you to Mars

You're not the one there...
There... there... there... there... there...

All night long, laid on my pillow,
These things are wrong.
I can't sleep here!

So lovely, so lovely, so lovely.

I have decided to leave you forever.
I have decided to start things from here.
Thunder and lightning won't change,
What I'm feeling and the daffodils look lovely today,
And the daffodils look lovely today,
Look lovely today.

Ooh, in your eyes I can see the disguise.
Ooh, in your eyes I can see the dismay.
Has anyone seen lightning?
Has anyone looked lovely?
And the daffodils look lovely today,
And the daffodils look lovely today,
Look lovely today...

Mary,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/mary.html,"Mary walks
down to the water's edge
and there she hangs her head
to find herself faded
a shadow of what she once was
She said ""How long have I been sleeping
and why do I feel so old
why do I feel so cold
my heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go""
With trembling hands she reaches up
a stranger's flesh is offered
and I would be the last to know
I would be the last the let it show
I would be the last to go
Take her hand
she will lead you through the fire
give you back hope
and hope that you won't take too much
respecting what is left
she cradled us
she held us in her arms
unselfish in her suffering she could not understand
that no one seemed to have the time
to cherish what was given
and I would be the last to know
and I would be the last to let it show
I would be the last to go...

And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love",2008,sad

Barricade,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/barricade.html,"Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
You were the only thing that mattered
There was no one for me but you
In Harmony Street we beat a man
Just for standing there
I held my breath as I watched you swing
Then run your fingers through your hair

Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do?
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you?

In Bermondsey in Burberry, you held me at the barricade, the pigs arrived with tear gas
And I wept at the mistakes we made
We stalked the streets like animals
And danced as windows shattered
For our island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered

Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart?
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart?

I found you on a Saturday, and that was where I lost you
You had finally walk away because of what it cost you, years later when I saw your face
In line to catch the morning train, you looked like you'd been softened
Like you never really loved the pain

Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish?
The thrill of blood comes instantly
There's only darkness at the finish

Meet me at the barricade, I'll be at the barricade
Meet me at the barricade, the love died, but the hate can't fade
I'll be at the barricade, the love died, but the hate won't fade...",2007,sad

A Comet Appears,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/acometappears.html,"One hand on this wily comet
Take a drink just to give me some weight
Some uber-man I'd make
I'm barely a vapor

They shone a chlorine light on
A host of individual sins
Let's carve my aging face off
Fetch us a knife
Start with my eyes
Down so the lines
Form a grimacing smile

Close your eyes to corral a virtue
Is this fooling anyone else?
Never worked so long and hard
To cement a failure

We can blow on our thumbs and posture
But the lonely are such delicate things
The wind from a wasp could blow them
Into the sea
With stones on their feet
Lost to the light and the loving we need

Still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing

With burnt sage and a forest of bygones
I click my heels
Get the devils in line
A list of things I could lay the blame on
Might give me a way out

But with each turn
It's this front and center
Like a dart stuck square in your eye
Every post you can hitch your faith on
Is a pie in the sky
Chock full of lies
A tool we devise
To make sinking stones fly

And still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing",2007,sad

Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good

Gather round all you clowns

And that I see a darkness.

Together or apart, alone or with our wives.
And we can stop our whoring and pull the smiles inside.

And I've made stairways
Such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You're so young. So sweet. So surprised

I saw a sign says ""OK""
Gotta take a ride just recline in the faraway
Got to take some time to realize
That my friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
So young. So sweet. So surprised
You look so young like a daisy in my lazy eyes

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry",2007,sad
Lady Sings The Blues,Billie Holiday,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieholiday/ladysingstheblues.html,"Lady sing the blues,
she's got them bad,
she feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
when you get a bad start,
when you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
i know i won't die,
'cause i love him

Lady sings the blues,
i'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
but now the world will know,
she's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,

In The Sun,Joseph Arthur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/josepharthur/inthesun.html,"I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You

I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there is anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me

May God's love be with you

May God's love be with you",2000,sad
I'll Fight,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/illfight.html,"I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you

I will, I will, I will

And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
On some old private hill abandoned by the mill
All my blood will spring and spill
I'll crash the air and be still

You'll wait with the star from a dream
And know that I am gone
You'll feel it in your heart
But not for very long

You'll rise each day as planned
Your will is your command
And stand each Sunday
A hymnal steady in your hand

And you'll sing to yourself
The rising falling melody
That you could never read
Without the choirs' lead
Still alone and lost in deep
And your soul will not be free

I will go, I will go, I will go
And in wars waters I will wade
And I will know if I remorse or regret
The fairness of our trade

For you to live, I took your place
A deal was made and I was paid
And the goal as I was told
Was a place where my body could be laid

And we will steal your life
And I own in better homes surrounded
By your peers without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near
And none will shed a tear
For the love no longer here

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I will
I'll fight, I'll fight,I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I will, I will, I will

I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you
I will
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
I will, I will, I will

And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
On a cross
My faith cannot by tossed
And my life will not be lost
If my love comes across",2009,sad

I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes

Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye

You can't possibly go without that",2006,sad

All my water colours fade to black
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm ten steps back
All my dreams have fallen flat

(Love don't show in the pavement cracks
There will be no turning back)

Time and space will pass us by and by
When we don't see eye to eye
I would have done anything
For happiness to bring ...
But it don't show up in the pavement cracks
I can't even cover up my tracks
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm light years back
Ooh I wish you well

How come
Every day
I'm still waiting for the change?
How come
I still say
Give me strength to live?

Where is my comfort zone?
A simple place to call my own
'Cause everything I wanna be
Comes crashing down on me
And it don't show up in the pavement cracks
I can't even recognise my tracks
You and I can't turn the whole thing back
Ooh I wish you well",2003,sad

Title Track,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/titletrack.html,"Left uninspired by the crust of railroad earth that touched the lead to the pages of your manuscript.
I took my thumb off the concrete and saved up all my strength to hammer pillars for a picket fence.
It wasn't quiet what it seemed... a lack of pleasantries (my able body isn't what it used to be).
I must admit I was charmed by your advances... your advantage left me helplessly into you.
Talking how the group had begun to splinter and I could taste your lipstick on the filter...
I tried my best to keep my distance from your dress but call-response overturns conviction every time.
My memory cannot recall... a wave of alcohol we shared a cigarette and shaved the hours off.
Lushing with the hallway congregation, my best judgement signed its resignation.
I rushed this.
We moved too fast, and tripped into the guestroom.",2000,sad

The minds ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures

Has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over

Watch me come undone

I pray when I'm coming down, you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you, your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum, and I'm your son

I come undone

So rock 'n' roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well-trained, so animal
So need your love, so fuck you all
I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to
If I stopped lying I'd just disappoint you

I come undone

If I ever hurt you, your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum, and I'm your son

So write another ballad, mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song, a love song
Do another interview, sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs, we sing love songs so sincere

So sincere

Come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
Come undone
I pray when I'm coming down, you'll be asleep
Come undone
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet

Pushing grocery carts

He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black

Can you see him in his lounger
Watching TV in the dark
Waiting for a spark
Till the sun turns black

Oh oh oh oh oh
Who are we
Oh oh oh oh oh
Who are we
Who are we

Can you see the working classes
Trudging through their days
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting
Till the sun turns black

Can you see the wise man simply
Living, loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity
Till the sun turns black",2006,sad

See the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit (cut) me

Sad veiled bride please be happy - handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you - and I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go - over and over...
I know it's over and it never really began but in my heart it was so real

""And if you're so clever then why are you on your own tonight?""
""And if you're so very entertaining then why are you on your own tonight?""
""And if you're so very good looking, then why do you sleep alone tonight?""
I know - 'cos tonight is just like any other night - that's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms - while they're in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind - over and over...
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes guts to be gentle and kind - over and over...

Sleep,The Roots,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roots/sleep.html,"[Verse 1: Aaron Livingston]
Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee

And I do not miss them yet
I wouldnât wish them on than worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
Iâm dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
Iâm fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
Itâs unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies

But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

Oh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why",2011,sad
Miami,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/miami.html,"I guess I think I feel alright
You come circling through the light
The skyline, baby, is bright tonight
That more perfect rendezvous
The sundown paints the shadows through
The daylight, Amy, on what we do

It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
Miami

Can I say
I wish that this weather would never leave
It just gets hard to believe
That god sent this angel to watch over me
Cause my angel
She don't receive my calls
Says I'm too dumb to fuck
Too dumb to fight
Too dumb to save
Well maybe I don't need no angel at all

It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
She could pull the sunlight through me
Coming down into Miami

Make a circle in the sand
Make a halo with your hands
I'll make a place for you to land

The bus is running
It's time to leave
The summer is gone and so are we
So come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans

Come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Oh yeah
Come on baby
Come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans

when the lord's been crying
too many years

I will walk away for them

Take It With Me,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/takeitwithme.html,"Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I
Drank champagne
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Old long since gone
Now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing
Ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Far far away a train
Whistle blows
Wherever you're goin
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end
Of the day
You're up and you're over
And you're far away

Always for you, and
Forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

All broken down by
The side of the road
I was never more alive or
Alone
I've worn the faces off
All the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go

Children are playing
At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn
It's got to be more
Than flesh and bone
All that you've loved
Is all you own

In a land there's a town
And in that town there's
A house
And in that house
There's a woman
And in that woman
There's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go",1999,sad
What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted,Jimmy Ruffin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmyruffin/whatbecomesofthebrokenhearted.html,"As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere...",,sad
If I Was Your Vampire,Marilyn Manson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/ifiwasyourvampire.html,"6 a.m. Christmas morning.
No shadows,
No reflections here.
Lying cheek to cheek
In your cold embrace.

So soft and so tragic
As a slaughterhouse.
You press the knife
Against your heart.
And say,
""I love you, so much you must kill me now.""

I love you
So much
You must kill me now.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come.

Digging your smile apart
With my spade-tounge.
The hole is where the heart is.
We built this tomb together,
And I won't fill it alone.
Beyond the pale
Everything is black,
No turning back.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.

If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart,
This is where it starts...
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart,
This is where it starts.
This is where it will end.
Here comes the moon again.

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain.
You'll burn,
I'll eat your ashes.
The impossible wheels seducing
Our corpse.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face
Because I think
Our time has come.

Beyond the pale
Everything is black
No turning back.
Beyond the pale
Everything's black
No turning back.

This is where it starts.
This is where it will end.
Here comes the moon again.

Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive

Not the loneliest guy

Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

All the errors left unlearned, oh
Well I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

Sometimes it Snows in April,Prince,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/prince/sometimesitsnowsinapril.html,"Tracy died soon after our long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here

I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past",ound,sad
This Ruined Puzzle,Dashboard Confessional,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dashboardconfessional/thisruinedpuzzle.html,"This ruined puzzle is beige with the pieces all face down
so the placing goes slowly.
The picture's of anything other than it's mean to be.
But the hours they creep,
the patterns repeat.
Don't be concerned, you know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said ""don't go.""

I've hidden a note,
it's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back.
It says, ""Does he ever get the girl?""
But what if the pages stay pressed,
the chapters unfinished,
the storied too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?

This basement's a coffin.
I'm buried alive.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
'Cause you're gone.
I get nothing
and you're off with barely a sigh.
I never said, ""Goodbye.""

They lean forwards when she hears
Well evil is all evil was
Birds are blue-eyed knees that buzz

How I'd love to live in you
Oh I've never been to michigan state
Still I'd wanna live in you

And you can't talk without your tongue
Don't try and drown without your lungs son
Well my snail has my favorite slow
The shell helps the snail still the skin lays low
And if my snail has my favorite slow
Then my cold has my favorite snow
But if my snail's cold and comes to a halt
Then my sea has my favorite salt
The salt keeps the sea from feeling sweet
And my toes have my favorite feet
And if I sweat salt
And the earth sweats heat

Regret,Anathema,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anathema/regret.html,"As I drift away... far away from you,
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Thinking to myself
""There's no escape from this
fear,
regret,
loneliness...""

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

I wish I didn't know now that
I never knew then...
Flashback
Memories punish me once again
Sometimes I remember all the pain
that I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might
have been...

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way
My future is not set
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live
without regret.

Long Gone,Syd Barrett,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sydbarrett/longgone.html,"She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind
the beauty of love's in her eyes...

She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I borrowed the page
from a leopard's cage
and I prowled in the evening sun's glaze
her head lifted high to the light in the sky
the opening dawn on her face...

She was long gone long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind

It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me

And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up, 
The ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depths of winter

And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of birds will sing to your 
beautiful heart
Upon the bough

And no more shall we part
Your chain of command 
Has been silenced now
And all of those birds 
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
Anyhow

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I will never be free
If I'm not free now

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I never was free

Alone You Breathe,Savatage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savatage/aloneyoubreathe.html,"You were never one for waiting
Still I always thought you'd wait for me
Have you from your dream awakened
And from where you are what do you see

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You're thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder
Staring from this end into your life

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rain swept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

And if this is all illusion
Nothing more than pure delusion
Clinging to a fading fantasy

Like Icarus who heeds the calling
Of a sun but now is falling
As the feathers of his life fall free
Can you see
See

Tomorrow
And after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here
Believing
That in the dark
There is a clue

Perhaps inside
This midnight sky
Perhaps tomorrow's new born eyes
Or could it be
We'll never know
And after all
This was the show

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Standing on a dream
Isn't what it seems
Could we then reclaim a dream refused
Knowing what we know
Could we let it go
Realizing that all the years are used

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue
I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue",1994,sad

I saw a light
Coming through the trees

Coming through the trees
Freshly cut lawns
And little children sleepwalking
I saw a light

I saw a light
Shining on a car
And a couple inside
Had committed suicide

Death in your arms
Death in your arms

I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
And I packed my things

After I saw the light
I packed my things
The light gave me life
Helped me see more clearly
And the children went to sleep
And the car was towed away
And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day

I saw a light
Getting smaller in the distance
And I said goodbye",2006,sad

Say I'll be okay...

Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on

Now that the lines been broken
I'm too afraid to just look back
The pages have left an empty space 
You were all I had
Why does it have to be this way
These things they'll never change

Tired of hearing the same old song
Everytime you came back frozen deep inside
Was it my love that you feared
I was a misfit all the way
Never there to help me grow and change my life
Then you smiled and walked away

Tell me why
Please tell me why
You stole my life
Tell me why

All the little things she said to me
Were broken thoughts and tainted dreams
If she can't take these memories
It doesn't change a thing
Every little word she said to me

I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box),Doug Stone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dougstone/idbebetteroffinapinebox.html,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

On a slow train back from Georgia

You must be a sorceress 'cause you just

Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is ""evol""
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over

You take my breath away

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

Lay down, and stretch upon the sea

If we beat him down, will he stay?
He's a little dizzy
I feel it starting to take me
Where did everybody go?
I need them now
If we beat him down... will he stay?",2001,sad
Fragilidad,Sting,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/fragilidad.html,"Ma'ana ya
La sangre no estar'
Al caer la lluvia
Se la llevara
Acero y piel
Combinaci'n tan cruel
Pero algo en nuestras mentes quedara
Un acto as' terminara
Con una vida y nada mas
Nada se logra con violencia
Ni se lograra
A todos los que han nacido
En un mundo as'
No olviden su fragilidad
Lloras tu
Y lloro yo

Someone Wake Me Up,The Veronicas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/veronicas/someonewakemeup.html,"We got the same friends
We're gonna have to see each other eventually
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
(how we're gonna deal with that, how we're gonna deal with that)
My CD's are at your place
And you know I'm gonna have to pick 'em up
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
(how we're gonna deal with that, how we're gonna deal with that)

Even though it was mutual, it still kills inside
'Cause for so long, how I've been defined

It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up?

Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making up
And if this is a dream I wonder,
Could someone wake me up?

I still have your old shirt
You know the one I said I'd thrown away?
I put it on when I went to bed last night
(I went to bed last night, I went to bed last night)
Baby, is this where our story ends
When I turn out the light
Fantasy and reality fight

It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up?

Will someone wake me up?

Could someone wake me up?

You Would Have Loved This,Tarja,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tarja/youwouldhavelovedthis.html,"The winter left her blanket
here this morning
A soft and gentle coverlet of white
Unfolded in the shadows of the dawn
It Sparked in the early morning light
You would have loved this
You would have loved this
This was your favorite time of day
The greenery is laid across the mantle
And ornaments are hanging on the tree
And cradled in the windowsill's a candle
A beacon in the night
to call you back to me
You would have loved this
You always loved this
I know you loved this time of year
And though I understand
One day again I'll see you
I long to touch your hand,
hear your voice, feel you
You would have loved this
You always loved this
Oh, how you loved.",2006,sad

Taking my time, seeing the signs
Letting you guide me home
Watching you grow, letting you know
You are my only

You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me

Tell you my fears, telling you everything
Telling the truth to you gives me wings
Free with my words, free as a bird
I am flying high looking at you
Everything new, you are my life

You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
So happy to carry you inside me

I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up

Alexandra Leaving,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/alexandraleaving.html,"Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Itâs not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked â
Do not choose a cowardâs explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving

Take This Waltz,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/takethiswaltz.html,"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears? 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!"" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is",1988,sad

Waiting for the Miracle,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/waitingforthemiracle.html,"Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb: 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.",1992,sad
Avalanche,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/avalanche.html,"Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul; 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold; 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind; 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed; 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor; 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.",1971,sad
The Traitor,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/thetraitor.html,"Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere"" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan"" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face",1979,sad
River of Sorrow,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/riverofsorrow.html,"There is a black river
It passes by my window
And late at night
All dolled up like Christ
I walk the water
Between the piers

Singing
Oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

For we all know the baby has expired
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
And no precious liar or well-wisher
Can return the love that was stolen

So oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Can you see the light
At the end of the dark passageway?
Take me with you towards the light
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Hear me, I'm whispering in your ear

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time

Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time",2000,sad

Teachers,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/teachers.html,"I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord? 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost? 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect? 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you? 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess? 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done? 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done?",1967,sad

May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials all over the place",1997,sad
Ballad of Big Nothing,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/balladofbignothing.html,"Throwing candy out to the crowd, dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley, having had enough of it all

Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you

All spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger

You can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you
Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to though it doesn't mean a thing
Big nothing",1997,sad
Master Song,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/mastersong.html,"I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread? 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring

If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because the spark is not within me. 

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The only thing that you keep changin' is your name
My love keeps growin' still the same 
Just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me 
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because your hands are not upon me. 

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The pains of love
And they keep growin', 
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
It's not within me.
It's not within me.
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say!
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!
Only word that I can say!",2004,sad
Winter,The Dodos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dodos/winter.html,"I know if I'll make it through this winter without you by my side
I waited for you so long while I traveled far and wide
Convinced myself there's no one better, so how could I deny
Your love, it's like a thorn into my side

My friends they understand me better but don't whisper goodnight
I want a lover and a sister, but we know that's not right
You used to listen to my music, I always wondered why
I wish I could pretend you make me try

I want the days to come, I want these sleepless nights to end
I lie here thinking how I lost you to all your stupid friends
You made me feel so foolish for the twenty-second time
Your love might be the last time that I try

Don't know if I'll make it through this winter without you on my own
I waited here for you forever, I can't believe you'd go
I may not have the answers, but I'd rather never know
Your love was such a heavy, heavy blow

Goodnight my love, you seemed so nice 'til I knew you better
Now I can tell you're always thinking twice about what might be better
On the outside, there's no conscience, you're a victim of your cautiousness
You don't try, you just lie there hoping that someone will come to make it right",2008,sad
Blue Ridge Mountains,Fleet Foxes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fleetfoxes/blueridgemountains.html,"Lie down with me, my dear
Lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me anytime you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-alikes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But, Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind
No",2008,sad

Last Days of Disco,Yo La Tengo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yolatengo/lastdaysofdisco.html,"Saw you at a party, you asked me to dance
Said the music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
And I was glad that I did this time

And the song said ""Let's be happy,"" I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

And the song said ""Let's be happy,"" I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said ""Don't be lonely,"" it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong

Remember like it wasn't long ago

Carry the Zero,Built to Spill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/builttospill/carrythezero.html,"I'm not knocking your want to carry that home
Took it with you when you moved and got it broke
Found the pieces, we counted them all alone
Didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero

I can't be your apologist very long
I'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on
Count your blemishes, you can't, they're all gone
I can't see your response putting them back on

Like they're waiting for your guard to fall
So they can see it all and you're so
Occupied with what other persons are
Occupied with, and vice versa

And you've become what you thought was dumb
A fraction of the sum
Yeah, you've become, yeah, you have become
A fraction of the sum, the middle and the front

And now it's coming back
Hasn't it come too far?
I was trying to help, but
I guess I pushed too hard

Now we can't even touch it
Afraid it'll fall apart",1999,sad

Say you're deaf and dumb and done
Give yourself another talk 
This time make it sound like someone

The noise is coming out, and if it's not out now
Then tomorrow, tomorrow
They took your life apart and called you failure's art
They were wrong though, they won't know
'Til tomorrow

I got static in my head
The reflected sound of everything
Tried to go to where it led
But it didn't lead to anything

The noise is coming out, but if it's not out now
I know it's just about to drown tomorrow out",1998,sad
Lion's Mane,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/lionsmane.html,"Run like a race for family
When you hear like you're alone
The rusted gears of morning
To faceless busy phones
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone

Love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
Love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
Love is the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thornbush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh

Love is a scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
Love's a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
Love is the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's mane",2002,sad

nothing survives
nothing survives

I think I'm turned around
I'm looking up not looking down
and when I'm standing still
watching you run
watching you fall, fall into me

Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase

I am displaced, I am displaced

And shes my friend of all friends
shes still here when everyone's gone
she doesn't have to say a thing
we'll just keep laughing 
all night long, all night long

Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase

The Drinks We Drank Last Night,Azure Ray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/azureray/thedrinkswedranklastnight.html,"Riding on these waves,
holding on to what you say,
""Everything will be okay,
it will work out one way.""

But I've drifted way too far,
my arms, my legs, have grown too tired.
And could you be inspired?
No, I'm just tired.

And on a swing you push me hard,
so I'll come back to where you are.
And you know I'm never far.
No decisions, nothing hard.

And I knew that it would rain tonight,
I'll take the bus or the next flight.
I won't give up on what feels right.

If you see these tears filling my eyes,
it's just the wind that makes me cry.
If you could feel this pain inside,
it's from the drinks we drank last night.
It's from the drinks we drank last night.  

And the shadow of our past,
projects on clouds of dust and gas.
Wounds where my eyes will rest,
the silhouette of loneliness.  

If you see these tears filling my eyes,
it's just the wind that makes me cry.
If you could feel this pain inside,
it's from the drinks we drank last night.
It's from the drinks we drank last night.",2003,sad
I Better Be Quiet Now,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/ibetterbequietnow.html,"Wish you gave me your number
Wish I could call you today

I'm getting further away
If I didn't know the difference
Living alone'd probably be okay
It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
A lot of hours to occupy
It was easy when I didn't know you yet
Things I'd have to forget
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, and getting upset
Maybe I got a problem
But that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet
Wish I knew what you were doing
And why you want to do it this way
So I can't go the distance
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away",2000,sad

Are you still on the stoop
Watching the windows close
I've not seen seen you lately
On the street, by the beach
Or places we used to go

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose

Tell me baby tell me
Does his company make 
Light of a rainy day
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak 
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose

Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change
I've been thinking lately
of a night on the stoop
and all that we wouldn't say

If I see you again
On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
Out from under my nose",2002,sad
Promising Light,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/promisinglight.html,"Time and all you gave
I was a jerk who preferred the sea
To tussling in the waves
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Now I see love
Dragged on the floor where you walked outside
Now I seek love
Looking for you in this other girl's eyes

Time and all you took
Only my freedom to fuck the whole world
Promising not to look
Promising light on the sidewalk girls

Now I see love
There in your car where I said those things
Now I see love
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Time and all you gave
There on your cross that I never saw
Well beyond the waves
Dunking my head when I heard you call

Now I see love
There in the scab where you pinched my leg
Now I see love
There on your side of my empty bed",2002,sad
Upward Over the Mountain,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/upwardoverthemountain.html,"Mother, don't worry. I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother, don't worry. I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother, remember being so stern with that girl who was with me?
Mother, remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body?

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying upwards over the mountain

Mother, I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
Mother, I lost it all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother, forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother, forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain

Mother, don't worry. I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother, don't worry. She's got a garden we're planting together
Mother, remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws,
And you cried 'til the morning.

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying always over the mountain",2002,sad

Being where
Love's a small word
A part-time thing
A paper ring

I know it's been done
Havin' one
Girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong

Don't know that I will

I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play
Games behind me

The clothes in the wardrobe
Just send them to me
Theres bills her for you

To make us who we want to be

Is she in the background

Did i build you a prison

Needles, guns, and grass

To me you're like a wild rose

I cried for you 
When the sky cried for you 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter 
But this life was not for you 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper

With your treasure, a secret for me to hold 

In many years they may forget 
This love of ours or that we met, 
They may not know 
how much you meant to me. 

I cried for you 
And the sky cried for you, 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter. 
But this life was not for you, 
Though I learned from you,

Without you now I see, 
How fragile the world can be 
And I know you've gone away 
But in my heart you'll always stay.

For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas
And you make them long, and you make them tough

Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day

Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air
Will you keep on building higher
'Til there's no more room up there?

You were longing to find.

Love's taken you far
Away from my heart,
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine,
A vision that's faded through time?
But you sailed away,
A fine summer's day,
Cause you heard it calling,
A new day dawning,
You were longing to find.

There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are

I said, ""I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""

She said, ""Why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light""
And then she kissed me
And I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free",1975,sad
Goodbye to Love,Carpenters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carpenters/goodbyetolove.html,"I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love
has passed me by
And all I know of love
is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it.

So I've made my mind up I must live
my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love.

There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories

And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for.

All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my
only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can.

What lies in the future
is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune
as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that
I've been wrong
But for now this is my song.

And it's goodbye to love

I'll say goodbye to love.",1972,sad
If You Go Away,Scott Walker,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/ifyougoaway.html,"If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird's song

If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees
And worship the wind

Then if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world
To stop turning, turning
'til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you?
Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
'til the next hello

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
Though the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow
Of your shadow
If it might have kept me
By your side",1969,sad
Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,Roberta Flack,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertaflack/willyoustilllovemetomorrow.html,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",1971,sad
Saturday Sun,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/saturdaysun.html,"Saturday sun
Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Saturday sun
Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday's sun
Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by",1969,sad

I will swing free until they cut me down 
Papa don't tell me what I could've done

I Hung My Head,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/ihungmyhead.html,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practise my aim

My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind.
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find.""

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Upon a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'd ride together
To Kingdom come
I prayed for God's mercy
For soon I'd be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head",2002,sad

The Good That Won't Come Out,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/thegoodthatwontcomeout.html,"Let's get together and talk about the modern age
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets just talking shit
About how we're all so upset about the dissapearing ground
As we watch it melt

It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them, standing here on this frozen lake

I do this thing where i think i'm real sick
But i won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stand real still in a real small place
As they chartup your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies i hide behind
It's such a big mistake, lying here in your warm embrace

Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again
I think i'll go out and embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say i choose sadness, that it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right

Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

It's all of the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
It's such a big mistake, standing here on this frozen lake
It's all the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust
If i don't tell you quick
Standing here on this frozen lake",2002,sad

Wasn't granted

No light in the dark

What have you found
That there's no time
There's no time

To think things through
To make sense

Like candles in the city,
You never looked so pretty
By power cuts and blackouts
Sleeping like babies

It gets you down
It gets you down

You're just playing a part

You're playing a part
Playing a part

You walked off with another man

I watched you give yourself away
You take them home into your bedroom
You had another busy day

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits
I can't take it

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Someday they'll put me in a squad car
Someday they'll throw away the key
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog
Cuz that's what you taught me to be

You looked into the eyes of men above you
I was the one who really tried to love you

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when yo play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Pull the trigger

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You know, you push me right to the limit

Walk your sunset strip, because I think you've needed it to get big, little kid.

The Night Starts Here,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/thenightstartshere.html,"The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear

The pleasure part, the afterthought, the missing stone in the graveyard
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to become a man
The dust at dawn is rained upon, attaches itself to everyone
No one is spared, no one is clean
It travels places you've never been or seen before

The night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea, and shout out ""Please come back to me""
You name your child after your fear, and tell them ""I have brought you here""

The scary part, the aftershock, the moment it takes to fall apart
The time we have, the task at hand, the love it takes to destroy a man
The ecstasy, the being free, the big black cloud over you and me
And after that, the upwards fall, and were we angels after all?
I don't know, I don't know...

The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here, forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea, and shout out ""Please come back to me""
You name your child after your fear, and tell them ""I have brought you here""

Song for Sharon,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/songforsharon.html,"I went to Staten Island.
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars...
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, ""Have children!""
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want right now
Is...find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by",1976,sad
The Golden Age,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/thegoldenage.html,"Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead

These days I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when it's day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're OK

These days I barely get by
I don't even try",2002,sad
Nobody's Fault But My Own,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/nobodysfaultbutmyown.html,"Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang
And let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew
It could be so sweet
Who could ever be so cruel,
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
That it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights
The way for you
When the road is full of nails,
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues
Are full of heartless tales
That drain on you
Who would ever notice you
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

Nobody's fault But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own...",1998,sad
Icicle,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/icicle.html,"Icicle icicle
Where are you going
I have a hiding place
When spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me
I hear them calling
Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

Greeting the monster in our Easter dresses
Father says bow your head like the good book says
Well I think the good book is missing some pages
Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

And when my hand touches myself
I can finally rest my head
And when they say take of his body
I think I'll take from mine instead

Getting off
Getting off
While they're all downstairs
Singing prayers
Sing away
He's in my pumpkin p.j.'s
Lay your book on my chest
Feel the word
Feel the word
Feel the word
The word feel it

I should have
I could have flown
You know I could have
I should have

Daredevil,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/daredevil.html,"I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot
Not so with the warmer lot
And all I want is a confidant
To help me laugh it off

And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Say I'm an airplane
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing
And I use them to give me lip
Hip hip for the lift
Hip hip for the drag
I want them all in my bag
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

Seek me out
Look at, look at, look at, look at me
I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up
Give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you
And never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
Skirt in my skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone",2012,sad
Kenji,Fort Minor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fortminor/kenji.html,"My father came from Japan in 1905
He was 15 when he immigrated from Japan
He worked until he was able to buy respect and build a store

Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream,
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means,
Close your eyes, just picture the scene,
As I paint it for you, it was World War II,
When this man named Kenji woke up,
Ken was not a soldier,
He was just a man with a family who owned a store in LA,
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did,
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids,
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran,
He moved to LA from Japan,
They called him 'Immigrant,'
In Japanese, he'd say he was called ""Issei,""
That meant 'First Generation In The United States,'
When everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs,
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack,
And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat,
His world went black 'cause,
Right there; front page news,
Three weeks before 1942,
""Pearl Harbour's Been Bombed And The Japs Are Comin',""
Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin',
Ken knew what it would lead to,
Just like he guessed, the President said,
""The evil Japanese in our home country will be locked away,""
They gave Ken, a couple of days,
To get his whole life packed in two bags,
Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes,
Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in,
So two trash bags is all they gave them,
When the kids asked mom ""Where are we goin'?""
Nobody even knew what to say to them,
Ken didn't wanna lie, he said ""The US is lookin' for spies,
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar,
Where a lot of Japanese people are,""
Stop it don't look at the gunmen,
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',
If you gonna run or not,
'Cause if you run then you might get shot,
Other than that try not to think about it,
Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded,
Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.

As soon as war broke out
The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and
""You have to come""
""All the Japanese have to go""
They took Mr. Ni
People didn't understand
Why did they have to take him?
Because he's an innocent laborer

So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them,
Every day, every night look down at them,
From watch towers up on the wall,
Ken couldn't really hate them at all;
They were just doin' their job and,
He wasn't gonna make any problems,
He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that,
He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made,
But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved,
Prisoners of war in their own damn country,
What for?
Time passed in the prison town,
He wondered if they would live it down, if and when they were free,
The only way out was joinin' the army,
And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on,
And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb,
That 15 kilotonne blast, put an end to the war pretty fast,
Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick,
Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife,
But, when they got back to their home,
What they saw made them feel so alone,
These people had trashed every room,
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors,
Written on the walls and the floor,
""Japs not welcome anymore.""
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside,
He, looked at his wife without words to say,
She looked back at him wiping tears away,
And, said ""Someday we'll be OK, someday,""
Now the names have been changed, but the story's true,
My family was locked up back in '42,
My family was there it was dark and damp,
And they called it an internment camp

When we first got back from camp... uh
It was... pretty... pretty bad

I, I remember my husband said
""Are we gonna stay 'til last?""
Then my husband died before they close the camp.",2005,sad
Little Girl Blue,Janis Joplin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisjoplin/littlegirlblue.html,"Sit there, hmm, count your fingers.

Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops
Oh, feel 'em falling down, oh honey all around you.
Honey don't you know it's time,
I feel it's time,
Somebody told you 'cause you got to know
That all you ever gonna have to count on
Or gonna wanna lean on
It's gonna feel just like those raindrops do
When they're falling down, honey, all around you.
Oh, I know you're unhappy. 

Oh sit there, ah go on, go on
And count your fingers.
I don't know what else, what else
Honey have you got to do.
And I know how you feel,
And I know you ain't got no reason to go on
And I know you feel that you must be through.
Oh honey, go on and sit right back down,
I want you to count, oh count your fingers,
Ah my unhappy, my unlucky
And my little, oh, girl blue.
I know you're unhappy,
Ooh ah, honey I know,
Baby I know just how you feel.",1969,sad
Sprout and the Bean,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/sproutandthebean.html,"I slept all day
I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved

That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string

And you can ask the counselor
And you can ask the king
And I'll say the same thing
And it's a funny thing

Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?

And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams
Of lead

When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
In the dirt of the day

And danger, danger drawing near them was a white coat
And danger, danger drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water, water running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter of the talking of the tadpoles

Who know the outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are you interested?",2004,sad
Monkey & Bear,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/monkeybear.html,"Down in the green hay
Where Monkey and Bear usually lay
They woke from a stable-boy's cry

Said, ""Someone come quick
The horses got loose, got grass-sick
They'll founder, Fain, they'll die""

What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?
By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey?
It is, stay by the gate you are given
And remain in your place, for your season
And had the overfed dead but listened
To the high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom

""Did you hear that, Bear?""
Said Monkey, ""We'll get out of here, fair and square
They left the gate open wide
So, my bride, here is my hand, where is your paw?
Try and understand my plan, Ursula
My heart is a furnace full of love that's just, and earnest
Now, you know that we must unlearn this
Allegiance to a life of service
And no longer answer to that heartless
Hay-monger, nor be his accomplice
The charlatan, with artless hustling
But Ursula, we've got to eat something
And earn our keep, while still within
The borders of the land that man has girded
All double-bolted and tightfisted
Until we reach the open country
A-steeped in milk and honey
Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me?
Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?
My love, I swear by the air I breathe
Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth

But for now, just dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon will you dance, my darling?
The hills are groaning with excess
Like a table ceaselessly being set
My darling we will get there yet""

They trooped past the guards
Past the coops, and the fields, and the farmyards
All night, till finally
The space they gained grew
Much farther than the stone that bear threw
To mark where they'd stop for tea

But, ""Walk a little faster, don't look backwards
Your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture
And the blackbirds hear tea whistling and rise and clap
Their applause caws the kettle black
And we can't have none of that
Move along, Bear, there, there, that's that""

Though cast in plaster
Our Ursula's heart beat faster
Than Monkey's ever will

But still, they have got to pay the bills
Hadn't they? That is what the monkey'd say
So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur
Or a kite, jerking tight at its tether
In her dun-brown gown of fur
And her jerkin of swansdown and leather
Bear would sway on her hindlegs
The organ would grind dregs of song for the pleasure
Of the children who'd shriek
Throwing coins at her feet then recoiling in terror

Sing, ""Dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there's a place for us
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh my darling there's a place for us

Oh darling, c'mon, will you dance, my darling?
You keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill
Where you'll ever-after eat your fill
Oh my darling, dear mine, if you dance
Dance darling and I'll love you still""

Deep in the night shone a weak and miserly light where the monkey shouldered his lamp
Someone had told him the bear'd been wandering a fair piece away from where they were camped
Someone had told him the bear had been sneaking away to the seaside caverns, to bathe
And the thought troubled the monkey for he was afraid of spelunking down in those caves
Also afraid what the village people would say if they saw the bear in that state
Lolling and splashing obscenely well, it seemed irrational, really washing that face
Washing that matted and flea-bit pelt in some sea-spit-shine, old kelp dripping with brine
But Monkey just laughed, and he muttered, ""When she comes back, Ursula will be bursting with pride
Till I jump up saying, 'You've been rolling in muck,' saying, 'You smell of garbage and grime'""

But far out, far out
By now, by now
Far out, by now, Bear ploughed
'Cause she would not drown

First the outside-legs of the bear up and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters
Then the outside-arms of the bear fell off, as easy as if sloughed from boiled tomatoes
Lowered in a genteel curtsy, bear shed the mantle of her diluvian shoulders
And, with a sigh, she allowed the burden of belly to drop, like an apron full of boulders
If you could hold up her threadbare coat to the light, where it's worn translucent in places
You'd see spots where, almost every night of the year, Bear had been mending, suspending that baseness
Now her coat drags through the water, bagging, with a life's-worth of hunger, limitless minnows
In the magnetic embrace, balletic and glacial, of Bear's insatiable shadow

Left there, left there
When Bear left bear
Left there, left there
When Bear stepped clear of Bear

Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth",2006,sad
Sawdust & Diamonds,Joanna Newsom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joannanewsom/sawdustdiamonds.html,"From the top of the flight of the wide white stairs
Through the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?
There's a bell in my ears, there's a wide white roar
Drop a bell down the stairs, hear it fall forever more
Hear it fall forever more

Drop a bell off of the dock
Blot it out in the sea
Drowning mute as a rock
And sounding mutiny

There's a light in the wings hits this system of strings from the side while they swing, see the wires, the wires, the wires
And the articulation in our elbows and knees makes us buckle and we couple in endless increase as the audience admires
And the little white dove made with love, made with love made with glue and a glove and some pliers
Swings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark, settle down, settle down my desire

And the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremor
Though no longer bereft, how I shook and I couldn't remember
And then the furthermost shake, drove a murdering stake in and cleft me right down through my center
And I shouldn't say so but I know that it was then or never

Push me back into a tree
Bind my buttons with salt
And fill my long ears with bees
Braying, ""Please, please, please
Oh you ought not, no you ought not""

And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings cut from cardboard and old magazines makes me warble and rise like a sparrow
And in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood, a cord or two, which you chop and you stack in your barrow
And it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood streaked with soot, heavy booted, and wild-eyed
As I crash through the rafters and the ropes and the pulleys trail after and the holiest belfry burns sky high

And then a slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision
While somewhere with your pliers and glue, you make your first incision
And in a moment of almost unbearable vision, doubled over with the hunger of lions
""Hold me close,"" cooed the dove, who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamonds

I wanted to say, ""Why the long face?""
Sparrow perch and play songs of long face
Burro buck and bray songs of long face
Sing, ""I will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long face
And though it may be madness, I will take to the grave your precious long face
And though our bones they may break and our souls separate, why the long face? 
And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil, why the long face?""

And in the trough of the waves
Which are pawing like dogs
Pitch we, pale-faced and grave
As I write in my log

Then I hear a noise from the hull
Seven days out to sea
And it is the damnable bell
And it tolls, well I believe, that it tolls
It tolls for me and it tolls for me

And though my wrists and my waist seem so easy to break still my dear I'd have walked you to the edge of the water
And they will recognize all the lines of your face in the face of the daughter, of the daughter, of my daughter
And darling we will be fine but what was yours and mine appears to me a sandcastle that the gibbering wave takes
But if it's all just the same then will you say my name? Say my name in the morning so that I know when the wave breaks

I wasn't born of a whistle or milked from a thistle at twilight
No, I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright
So enough of this terror we deserve to know light and grow evermore lighter and lighter
You would have seen me through but I could not undo that desire

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh desire, oh

Desire, desire
Desire, desire

From the top of the flight of the wide white stairs
Through the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?",2006,sad

Can hurt you somehow.

For Annachie Gordon he's bonny and he's bright
He'd entice any woman that e'er, e'er he saw
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
And I never will forget my love Annachie

Down came her father, he's standing at the door
Saying Jeannie you are trying the tricks of a whore
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie
For Annachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands
For the Sultan's lands are broad and his towers they run high
You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie.

With Annachie Gordon I beg for my bread
Before I marry Sultan his gold to my head
With gold to my head and straight down to my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
And you who are my parents to church you may me bring
But unto Lord Sultan I'll never bear a son
To a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie.

Jeannie was married and from church was brought home
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
When she and her maidens all merry should have been
She goes into her chamber and cries all alone.

Come to bed my Jeannie my honey and my sweet
To stile you my mistress it would be so sweet
Be it mistress or Jeannie it's all the same to me
But in your bed Lord Sultan I never will lie
And down came her father, he's spoken with renown
Saying you who are her maidens
Come loosen up her gowns
And she fell down to the floor
And straight down to her knee saying
Father look I'm dying for my love Annachie.

The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
And the day that young Annachie came home on the tide
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
Saying oh you've been so long, you've been so long on the sands
So long on the sands, so long upon the floods
They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead.

You who are her maidens come take me by the hand
And lead me to the chamber where my love she lies in
And he kissed her cold lips till his heart it turned to stone
And he died in the chamber that his love she lies in.",1989,sad
Natural Anthem,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/naturalanthem.html,"I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing
It will be a natural anthem, familiar it will seem
It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day

I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places I have taken from real life
So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right...",2003,sad

Deliver me, from all of the madness

Shatter,Liz Phair,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lizphair/shatter.html,"I know that I don't always realize
How sleazy it is messing with these guys
But something about just being with you
Slapped me right in the face, nearly broke me in two
It's a mark I've taken heart
And I know I will carry it with me for a long, long time

I don't know if I could drive a car
Fast enough to get to where you are
Or wild enough not to miss the boat completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe
You know, just maybe

I don't know if I could fly a plane
Well enough to tail spin out your name
Or high enough to lose control completely
Honey, I'm thinking maybe
You know, just maybe
Maybe",1993,sad

Kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swingin' from side to side

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So, why can't you forgive me?

You are always tryin' to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

We both have shiny, happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan!
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Squinched up your face and did a dance
Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Gotta figure out a way
I'm losing my senses to you
Where'd it go?
The bluebird I should follow back home?
But where is home?

Guess it won't amount to much
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line

Don't believe a thing they say,
Today
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

All alone
But I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking in quicksand tonight
You pick me up
And I shine across the sky
'Til morning, then you color me in

Guess it won't amount to much
Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line

Don't believe a thing they say
Today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way,
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Gotta get it in time
Gotta get it last time

Don't believe a thing they say
Today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way,
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Don't believe a thing they say

Turn around and walk away

The Dumbing Down Of Love,Frou Frou,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/froufrou/thedumbingdownoflove.html,"Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love

Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without
Without love

No no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
Cause no-one's receiving
This tunnel vision
Is turning out all wrong

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love
Without love
Without love

Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love

Without love
Without love
Yeah, yeah",2002,sad
The Bagman's Gambit,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/thebagmansgambit.html,"On the lam from the law 
On the steps of the capitol 
You shot a plainclothes cop on the ten o'clock 
And I saw momentarily 
They flashed a photograph, it couldn't be you 
You'd been abused so horribly 
But you were there in some anonymous room 
And I recall that fall 
I was working for the government 
And in a bathroom stall off the National Mall 
How we kissed so sweetly 
How could I refuse a favor or two 
For a trist in the greenery 
I gave you documents and microfilm, too 

And from my ten floor tenement 
Where once our bodies lay 
How I long to hear you say 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

It was late one night 
I was awoken by the telephone 
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line 
Purloined in Petrograd 
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay 
So I paid off a bureaucrat 
To convince your captors they're to secret you away 

And at the gate of the embassy 
Our hands met through the bars 
As your whisper stilled my heart 
No, they'll never catch me now 
No, they'll never catch me 
No, they cannot catch me now 
We will escape somehow 
Somehow 

And I dreamt one night 
You were there in fours 
Head held high 
In uniform 

It was ten years on 
When you resurfaced in a motorcar 
With the wave of an arm 
You were there and gone",2005,sad

But it can't chill my heart

My dream world fell apart.

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' so long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet daddy please come home

As they go strollin' by
And all the things that might have been

If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk

Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape

If you take me there you'll get relief

Somewhere In My Broken Heart,Billy Dean,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billydean/somewhereinmybrokenheart.html,"You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly, go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken heart

Girl, I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see 
It's somewhere in my broken

When It Rains,Paramore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paramore/whenitrains.html,"And when it rains
On this side of town it touches, everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing

At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that
It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

You always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything

At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep 'til May
And you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
And no, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around (take your time)
Take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (take my...)
Just turn it around

Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain 
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry

Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

I Can't Unlove You,Kenny Rogers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennyrogers/icantunloveyou.html,"Postcards and letters
And pictures made to last forever
To be boxed up and tossed away
Knickknacks and souvenirs
In an afternoon, they're out of here
They'll disappear without a trace
But what they mean to me
Can never be replaced

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Interstates and old songs
Like time they go on and on
I guess I could learn to do the same
I could wake up without you
These two arms not around you
Tell myself it's meant to be this way
No matter how I try somethings I can't change

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, no

I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory

She called me up, late that night
She said, ""Joe, don't come over
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door

I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done, he's got a gun
So run, Joey run, Joey run!""

'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me, with tear-filled eyes
And bruises on her face

All at once I saw him there
Sneakin' up behind me (Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, ""He's got a gun!""
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling
I ran to her, I held her close
When I looked down, my hands were red!
And here's the last words Julie said...

Do you know the things that I can do?

In gray afternoons

You held the rain

I don't care if it's clear

There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage
Heartbreak does

Just returns to my back to weigh me down...

We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band

Reminiscences gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds...

All completeness in the morning
Asleep on your side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride

She responds like a limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
To the shuddering breath of yesterday...

There's the succour of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams

As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favour of making sweet sixteen...

You make my life and times
A book of bluesy Saturdays
And I have to choose...",1973,sad

Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray

And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do

If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began

Would blow your heart away

And tell me who is gonna love
I wanna know who is gonna love
I need to know who's gonna love
Who's gonna love, who, who, who, oh

Where, where will you go, baby
Who's gonna love you baby, tell me
Who's gonna care for you baby
Who's gonna be there for you baby
Who's gonna love you like you need to be loved
Oh where will you go, baby
And who's gonna love you like I do

Oh I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
Like I do",1989,sad
Missing You,Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/case/missingyou.html,"Standing here looking out my window
My nights are long and my days are cold
Cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now
But I can't let go

[1] - Every day I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that 
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

[2] - Like a cold Summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

Driving 'round thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
Cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
Cause my loneliness got the best of me
And my heart's so weak

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whatsername,Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/whatsername.html,"Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what's his face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
From so long ago

(Go, go, go, go)

And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time.",2004,sad
Ribbons Undone,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/ribbonsundone.html,"She's a girl
Rising from a shell
Running to spring
It is her time it is her time
Watch her run with ribbons undone

She's a rose in a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right there will be time
To chase the sun with ribbons undone

She runs like a fire does
Just picking up daises
Comes in for a landing
A pure flash of lightening
Past alice blue blossoms
You follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you
Arms filled with lavender

Yes my little pony is growing up fast
She corrects me and says
""You mean a thoroughbred""
A look in her eyes says the battle's beginning
From school she comes home and cries
I don't want to grow up Mom at last not tonight

You're a girl
Rising from a shell
Running through spring
With summer's hand in reach now
It is your time
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
It is your time yes my angel
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone

Run run darlin'
Ribbons undone",2005,sad
Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanjackson/wherewereyouwhentheworldstoppedturning.html,"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?

Did you stand there in shock
At the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger
In fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?

Did you burst out with pride
For the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died
Just doin' what they do?

Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?

Did you feel guilty
'Cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother
And tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?

Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN
But I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?",2002,sad
Without You Here,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/withoutyouhere.html,"Your love's a gathered storm I chased across the sky
A moment in your arms became the reason why
And you're still the only light that fills the emptiness
The only one I need until my dying breath
And I would give you everything just to
Feel your open arms
And I'm not sure I believe anything I feel

And now, now that you're near
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

And I'm trying to believe
In things that I don't know
The turning of the world
The color of your soul
That love could kill the pain
Truth is never vain
It turns strangers into lovers
And enemies to brothers
Just say you understand
I never had this planned

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here
Without you here
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here

My head lies to my heart 
And my heart it still believes
It seems the ones who love us are the ones
That we deceive
But you're changing everything
You're changing everything in me

And now, now that you're near 
There's nothing more without you 
Without you here",2006,sad
Break It Up,Scooter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scooter/breakitup.html,"Where in the world, where in the world
Where in the world did I get this hurt
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me bad, call me wrong
Call me anything but your own
I don't mind, I don't mind

I don't care if you leave me
I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this
I don't mind

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

So where in the world, where in the world,
Where in the world can I hide this hurt,
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind

If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brand new ride
But babe please don't tell me so

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

Break it up, just break it up",1996,sad
The Forgotten,Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/theforgotten.html,"Where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Theyâre lost inside your memory
Youâre dragging on, your heartâs been broken
As we all go down in history

Where in the world did the time go?
Itâs where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Well donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen

I donât feel strange, itâs more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I canât quite put my finger on it
But itâs like a child that was left behind

So where in the worldâs the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love

Well, donât look away from the arms of a bad dream
Donât look away, sometimes youâre better lost than to be seen
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of tomorrow
Donât look away from the arms of a moment
Donât look away from the arms of love",2012,sad
If You're Reading This,Tim McGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timmcgraw/ifyourereadingthis.html,"If you're reading this
My Mommas sitting there
Looks like I only got a one way ticket over here
Sure wish I
Could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

[Chorus:]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my Momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
Half way around the world
I wonât be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stands up for the innocent and the weak

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up my boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

[Chorus]

If you're reading this
Thereâs going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find some one else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

All at Once,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/allatonce.html,"All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

[Chorus:]
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

[Chorus]",1985,sad
Living Proof,Ricky Van Shelton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickyvanshelton/livingproof.html,"She hangs up the phone and her heart starts to pound
Someone just told her an old friend's in town
And a million old feelings come rushing in
Start tearing to pieces what it took years to mend

She's living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
She just can't forget it, Lord knows, she's tried
She's living proof, true love never dies

You answer the door and I say, ""Hello""
If you don't want to see me, just tell me, I'll go
But I can't love without you, it's only pretend
There's no love like you're sweet love, can we try it again?

We're living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
I just can't forget you, Lord knows, I've tried
We're living proof, true love never dies
Yes, we're living proof, true love never dies",1988,sad
She Don't Want the World,3 Doors Down,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/3doorsdown/shedontwanttheworld.html,"The open wound she hides
She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
And that's ok, she don't want the world

All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
And that's ok, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

Those words he never spoke
Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more
But it's ok, she don't want the world

Softly in her sleep
Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear
She just smiles, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
And it's ok, she don't want the world",2008,sad
How Could an Angel Break My Heart,Toni Braxton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/howcouldanangelbreakmyheart.html,"I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine

I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name

I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Oh, my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Feel The Silence,Goo Goo Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/googoodolls/feelthesilence.html,"You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry
All you remember now
Is what you feel

The truth remains
In midnight conversations
I asked for this moment
But you turned away

Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain

And you remain
A promise unfulfilled
I ask you for more
But you push me away

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside us
Looking for something more to say
I don't know where I'm going
Only know where I been
But you move through my soul like a hurricane wind
We've been so lost for so long
I don't know how to get back again 
And we're drowning in the water
That flows under this bridge
When you're fighting the current
You forget how to live
And I wanted to reach you but I don't know where to begin
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled until today

And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside
Everything means more now than
Words could explain
And if we feel the silence
Leaving this all behind us
When it's gone what will you say

How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on
How do we hold on

You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry",2006,sad
Little Miss Perfect,Sugababes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugababes/littlemissperfect.html,"Iâm the most responsible girl that I know
Never late, always on time for the show
Ask anyone around me
And theyâll tell you just how I am, yeah

I try to tell the truth every chance that I get
I never let the work Iâm doing get to my head
And when it came to love
I thought I gave it the best I had, yeah

But somewhere I missed, somewhere I slipped
Somewhere, thereâs a couple steps that I skipped
Somehow, I told myself I didnât need anyone

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone
Now, itâs so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that âLittle Miss Perfectâ
Wasnât that perfect after all

Now everything around me
Feels out of place
Like all four walls are closing in
And thereâs no escape

Everyday spent without you
It gets harder to act like Iâm okay
If I could take back the things that I said
If I could un-break all that we had
Iâd put all the pieces back together again

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone
Now, itâs so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that âLittle Miss Perfectâ
Wasnât that perfect after all

The world that I know is all crashing down
And itâs the biggest shock to me
âCause I thought I had it all figured out
So, why does my heart feel empty?
Oh

I thought it was perfect
But it wasnât so perfect

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that youâre gone

The Way Down,The White Tie Affair,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitetieaffair/thewaydown.html,"You know reactions speak louder than words.
Thought we were past that,
forget what you heard.
Pay no attention.
Better to shut out the light,
than to find yourself at home all alone
thinkin' of me tonight.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere
and I don't think we'll survive.

A fall from up so high,
the tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Everything was perfect,
till the train went right off the rail.
Like we were passed out,
asleep at the wheel.
When you know you've lost it,
there's no one in control.
And you will find yourself too high.
Better just try letting go.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere

Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Now that the smoke is gone,
I can see that I'm all alone.
Forever has been long enough.
I need you to come back home.

The tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Love Hurts,Jon B.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonb/lovehurts.html,"Sometimes love can feel
Like the closest thing to heaven
Sometimes love can feel
Like you've been run over by a car
Yes it can it's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you dowm on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
Cause love can sure hurt sometimes

Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
Love hurts and it don't

It's the best thing for the heart
Yes they will what they fail to tell you
It can tear your life apart
But you know it's as sweet as a summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing, everybody sing

Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't

When you know that you're alive
Cause you feel so much pain
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to say
Then you know, yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't

Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings

Lose my mind, go insane, turn my face to the pourin' rain
There's nothin' I wouldn't do if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

If there's no way to make it work
I'll find a way to hide the hurt 
I'll do my best to do what's best for you.

I'll just take your memory and disappear quietly
Quit acting like a fool if you want me to.

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to.

Ohh if it takes good-bye to make you happy

[English translation:]

Oh woah...

A girl like you is such a confusing set
Of questions and answers
So I shut my mouth
I bury love inside the farewell
Outside the window, the forgotten rain and wind blows
In the wee hours of the night
I hear familiar songs from the radio
It's perfect for thinking about you
There are two empty cups of coffee
In this place without you, I fight with loneliness

I walk alone on the streets
I go to the cafe I used to go a lot, I go watch a movie

I lock even myself in the memories, how about you?
This weather, this temperature
This passing wind, will I remember it?
A person to be forgotten
Like a passing by black and white film
I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
(I draw you with a pencil, I erase you
With an eraser that is the falling rain)
Oh woah...
(I draw you out again today
Will I be able to erase you?)

A bright red umbrella
Wet and drenched clothes and sneakers
I turn off and turn on the boiler
Whatever I do, it doesn't dry
Is that how I feel or is it not?
A confusing set of questions and answers

On a rainy day, I fell for you
We used to love
Each other so much
It didn't seem like we had to do this
So my heart hurts so much (heart hurts)
(From the beginning, I held you in the left side
Of my heart and you thickly remain)
Now you remain as a broken fragment
That's deeply engraved inside
You pull me in
I think I lied when I said I could live without you
I throw away my feelings
But I still miss you as I fall asleep
But on this a rainy night, I cannot fall asleep

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Dear sky, please help me
Please stop this rain
So that I can forget her, oh no

Is this sound of the rain, your voice?
Is this a sound that calls to me?
Am I the only one thinking of you?
Will this rain comfort me?
Do you know how I feel?
I keep thinking of you

Oh woah...
Outside the window
The sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days, I miss you and our kiss
Oh woah...
Outside the window, the sound of the rain rings
I remember the memories of us
I can't live without u girl
On rainy days
I always run into you",P:  ,sad
Pictures of Me,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/picturesofme.html,"Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease

Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op TV
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong

You go walking by
Here come another guy
Jailer who sells
Personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease",1997,sad
Change Is Hard,She & Him,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shehim/changeishard.html,"I'm all out of luck
But what else 
Could I be?
I know he's yours
And he'll never belong
To me again

I did him wrong
So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know

So I'll keep my head down
If you keep it quiet from now on
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Than the bells of new love

So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know",2008,sad
California,Copeland,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/copeland/california.html,"I miss the way you sing low
So I can't hear your voice over
The radio in my car
But you knew every word they sang
You know just the right thing to say when the
Distance rips us farther and farther and farther away
I'll see you soon

If you're coming back this way again
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

Maybe I fell too fast
Maybe I pushed you away
Now you're gone and I'm afraid
That you're never coming back this way again

I'll see you soon
If you'll come back here
I'll see you soon
Just say that you want to see me too

Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

You know I won't mind if you
Monopolize all my time
I won't say a thing at all
I won't say a word no

So come back from California
Come back from California",2003,sad
Welcome Home,Radical Face,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radicalface/welcomehome.html,"Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun, and the days blur into one
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done

Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much, but we've made the most
Welcome home

Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost

Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I've come home

All my nightmares escape my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs
I feel your thumbs
Press into my skin again",2007,sad
Comforting Sounds,Mew,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mew/comfortingsounds.html,"I don't feel alright
In spite of these comforting sounds
You make
I don't feel alright
Because you make promises
That you break
Into your house
Why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
It's hard to make sense
Feels as if I'm sensing you
Through a lens
If someone else comes
I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude
And probably you know
All the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it
Honestly
Back when we were kids
We would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are
Messing up
Nobody has gained or
Accomplished anything",2000,sad
I'll Wait for You,Joe Nichols,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joenichols/illwaitforyou.html,"The snow in Montana was three feet high
Lady at the counter said,
""There ain't no flights""
So he called her on the telephone,
He said I'll rent a car
And I'll drive home.

She said,
I'll wait for you like I did last year
At Christmas time with you family here,
And your truck broke down
Out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped
Till you got home,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

Now he's on his cell phone
In a Coupe deVille
Talking to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breaking
Cause she's there alone
Her heart is aching
Cause she wants him home

She says i'll wait for you
Like in '68 when our child was due
I said It will have to wait
Until his dad gets here,
And stands by my side,
Remember dear our son's first cry.
Soh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

He didn't stop all day
To eat a bite,
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said she's in a better place
She said to give you this note,
Just in case.

And it said I'll wait for you
At heaven's gate,
Oh I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell St. Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend,
Oh this ain't nothing new,
Sweetheart I'll wait for you.

P.S. I love you too
Sweatheart I'll wait for you...",2005,sad
He Stopped Loving Her Today,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/hestoppedlovinghertoday.html,"He said, ""I'll love you till I die""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy, now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today",1980,sad
Years,Barbara Mandrell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barbaramandrell/years.html,"Faded photographs
The feelings all come back
Even now sometimes
You feel so near
And I still see your face
Like it was yesterday
It's strange how the days turned into years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

Nighttime gently falls
Another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years

Years of hanging on
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

After all these years...",1979,sad
Days Like These,Janis Ian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisian/dayslikethese.html,"On days like these
When the rain won't fall
And the sky is so dry
That even birds can't call
I can feel your tears
Disappearing in the air
Carried on the breeze
On days like these

It's years like these
That make a young man old
Bend his back against the promises
That life should hold
They can make him wise
They can drive him to his knees
Nothing comes for free
On days like these

But you can't reap what you don't sow
And you can't plant in fallow ground
So let us fill this empty earth with hope
Until the rains come down

In lives like these
Where every moment counts
I add up all the things
That I can live without
When the one thing left
Is the blessing of my dreams
I can make my peace
With days like these

I can make my peace
With days like these",2000,sad
The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore,The Walker Brothers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/walkerbrothers/thesunaintgonnashineanymore.html,"Loneliness
Is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue
Is always there

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love, baby

Emptiness
Is a place you're in
With nothing to lose
But no more to win

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love

Lonely
Without you baby
Girl I need you
I can't go on

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
(The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky)
The tears are always clouding your eyes
(The tears are always clouding your eyes)
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love, baby

Till It Happens to You,Corinne Bailey Rae,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/corinnebaileyrae/tillithappenstoyou.html,"I know what I said
Was heat of the moment
But theres a little truth in between the words we've spoken
Its a little late now to fix the heart thats broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going
Cause I don't know
No I don't know anymore

It used to feel like heaven
Used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But you wont believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same now when I'm with you
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen
When our love was new
Oooh love I'm a fool to believe in you
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
Anymore

It used to feel like heaven
It used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth
Until their hearts broken
Don't you dare tell them
What you think to do
Till they get over
You can only learn these things
From experience
When you get older
I just wish that someone would have told me
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you",2006,sad

Why do you see right through me

I live, I breathe, I let it rain on me
I sleep, I wake, I try hard not to break
I crave, I love, I've waited long enough
I try as hard as I can

Am I not pretty enough
Is my heart too broken
Do I cry too much
Am I too outspoken

Don't I make you laugh
Should I try it harder

I fall, I freeze, I pray down on my knees
I hope, I stand, I take it like a man
I try as hard as I can

Six O'Clock News,Kathleen Edwards,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kathleenedwards/sixoclocknews.html,"Copper on the corner and he loaded two rounds
And I can't even get inside to talk you down
Peter, sweet baby, where'd you get that gun?
You spend half your life trying to turn the other half around

And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use
Your face is all over six o'clock news
They cleared the street and then they closed the schools
I can't even get inside

Did you lose your head when the farm went down?
Was is when your daddy died after he moved to town
And I know your momma calls you good for nothing
She says her baby is a failer and she don't want you calling

Peter, sweet baby, there's something I need to say to you
Gonna have your baby this coming June
We could get a little place down by Gilmour park
You could do a little time and save my broken heart

And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use
Copper when ahead and he just shot you through
Now you're lying dead on the avenue
And I can't feel my broken heart",2003,sad

She left her ring on the pillow
Right where it wouldn't be missed
She left a note in the kitchen
Next to the grocery list

It said, you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do you care if I go

He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldn't remember what for
So he said I've been doing some thinking
I've been thinking that maybe you're right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night

And you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am

In molasses. Oh no!

Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna rain today.

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,
the frozen smiles to chase love away.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna rain today.

Lonely, lonely.
Tin can at my feet,
I think I'll kick it down the street.
That's the way to treat a friend.

Right before me the signs implore me:
Help the needy and show them the way.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna rain today.

Lonely, so lonely.
Tin can at my feet,
I think I'll kick it down the street.
That's the way to treat a friend.

Right before me the signs implore me:
Help the needy and show them the way.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna rain today.",ound,sad
Unloveable,The Smiths,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smiths/unloveable.html,"Oh...

The Point of It All,Amanda Palmer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amandapalmer/thepointofitall.html,"Oh, what a noble, distinguished collection of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again: no we'll wait, no we promise, we'll wait
June makes these excellent sewing machines out of common industrial waste
She spends a few days at a time on the couch but she says
She wears shades, she wears shades

But no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
And you're learning that just 'cause they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call...

They made the comment in jest
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all

Maybe a week in the tropics would help to remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on a deck with a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple weeks later we came back and you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet
Eyes fixed to the place where the dryer had been

Oh, but no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
Why on earth would I keep you propped up in here when you so love the fall...?

The pattern's laid out on the bed
With dozens of colors of thread
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point in the end

But it's better to waste your day watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
Than to put yourself in it and turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
But while you were sleeping some men came around
Said they had some dimensions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about but they sure made a mess of your face

But still, no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for playing along
You're almost human, even now

And just 'cause they call themselves experts
It doesn't mean sweet fuck all...
They've got the permanent press
Homes with a stable address

And they've got excitement
And life by the fistful
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all",2008,sad
Perfect Enemy,t.A.T.u.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tatu/perfectenemy.html,"Why should I welcome
Your domination
Why should I listen
To explanations
I'm not pretending
To make it simple
Try to be something
Experimental
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before,
are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll Forever stay
Your perfect enemy

No longer waiting
Remove illusions
No more complaining
Forget confusion
No more compassion
Not sentimental
I am now something
Experimental
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before,
are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll Forever stay
Your perfect enemy",2005,sad
The Rose,Bette Midler,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bettemidler/therose.html,"Some say, ""Love. It is a river
That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love. It is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""
Some say, ""Love. It is a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love. It is a flower
And you its only seed""

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",ound,sad
Born in the USA,Bruce Springsteen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/bornintheusa.html,"Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering up

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says ""Son if it was up to me""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said ""Son, don't you understand""

I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone

He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A.",1984,sad
Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),Phil Collins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/philcollins/againstalloddstakealookatmenow.html,"How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take

Take a look at me now",,sad

Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry

I made it through the day
I watched the world outside

Said, ""Why you always running in place?""

Tell my father

This is my life
I hope they understand

Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid
Of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close
It's only for today

She waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Here's my chance
This is my chance

Tell my father

What About Now,Daughtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daughtry/whataboutnow.html,"Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
But are not saying
Can we see beyond the stars
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love, it never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far
Just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life
I am yours

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

Would always feel the same

The Only One,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/theonlyone.html,"You know you're not the only one
When they all come crashing down, midflight,
You know you're not the only one.
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life.
You know you're not the only one.

We're all grieving,
Lost and bleeding.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me.

So afraid to open your eyes, hypnotized.
You know you're not the only one
Never understood this life.
And you're right, I don't deserve
But you know I'm not the only one.

We're all grieving,
Lost and bleeding.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me.

Don't look down,
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you.
Don't look down, you'll fall down,
You'll become their sacrifice.

Right or wrong.
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you.
If I can't feel, I'm not mine,
I'm not real.

All our lives,
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies,
I'm not believing,
Heaven shine a light down on me.",2006,sad
Cold as You,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/coldasyou.html,"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you",2006,sad
They Won't Go When I Go,George Michael,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgemichael/theywontgowhenigo.html,"No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when i go

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him i'll bide
Because they won't go when i go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
They won't go when i go

And i'll go where i've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
They won't go when i go

Since my soul conceived 
All that i believe
The kingdom i will see
'Cause they won't go when i go

When i go
Where i'll go
No one can keep me
From my destiny",1990,sad
The Love Thieves,Depeche Mode,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/depechemode/thelovethieves.html,"Oh the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With all their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their trades
But they'll always be failures

Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirits shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as adam is eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers",1997,sad
Nothing to Give,White Lies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitelies/nothingtogive.html,"You talked me to sleep last night
I hadn't felt that sad in years
Your eyes like glass mistakes
They moved me close to tears
You speak those favorite fables
Which I am yet to live
And casually confirm my fears
That I've got nothing to give

I wish I could say
That I've got no regrets
But saying that would be one more
To pile on my desk
I wish I could say I've clung to time like gold
But as you said goodbye I almost died
I almost died

I take it back all of it
Those names I called myself
The heroes of my childhood
Like hardbacks on the shelf
I take it back those promises
I made to everyone
I'm falling through a ribbon last
Before I'd learn to run

I wish I could say
That I've got no regrets
But saying that would be one more
To pile on my desk
I wish I could say I've clung to time like gold
But as you said goodbye I almost died
I almost died
I almost died",2009,sad

Why do these eyes of mine cry

Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world

Oh, if this old house could talk 
It would break my heart in two
I couldn't stand to be reminded 
Of all the things we used to do
There's no love in this old house no more
So I got it up for sale
Why, if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell

Oh, if this old house could talk
I know what it would say
I'm as lonesome as you are
And I feel nonempty everyday
Well, I even miss the babies 
Who built me up to feel this way
Why, if this old house could talk
Lord, I know what it would say

If this old house could talk
What a story it would tell
We built this home together
And with love we drove each nail
Take me in your arms and hold me
'Cause we've been apart too long
Why if this old house could talk
All it would say is welcome home",2004,sad

A Good Year For The Roses,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/agoodyearfortheroses.html,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them 
While you packed

And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes 
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses 

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you  
Haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say
We haven't said
While a million thoughts
Go runnin' through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin'
Goes unheard

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes 
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses",1971,sad
The Piano,PJ Harvey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pjharvey/thepiano.html,"Hit her with a hammer
Teeth smashed in
Red tongue twitching
Look inside her skeleton

My fingers sting
Where I feel your fingers have been
Ghostly fingers
Moving my limbs

Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you

Daddy's in the corner
Rattling his keys
Mommy's in the doorway
Trying to leave

Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening

Beautiful Goodbye,Amanda Marshall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amandamarshall/beautifulgoodbye.html,"I'm fed up with my destiny
And this place of no return
I think I'll take another day
And slowly watch it burn
And it doesn't really matter
How the time goes by
'Cause I still remember you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

We staggered through these empty streets
Laughing arm in arm
The night had made a mess of me
Your confessions kept me warm
I don't really miss you, I just need to know
Do you ever think of you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

In these days of no regrets
I keep mine to myself
And all the things we never said
I can save for someone else
And nothing lasts forever
But we always try
And I just can't help but wonder why
We let it pass us by, yeah

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

Baby, what can I do
Oh, to get through to you
And sometimes I cry, yeah
It's a fool's lullaby
Sometimes I cry
It's just a fool's lullaby
I'm dying inside",1995,sad
Blind Love,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/blindlove.html,"Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames
And I don't care if they miss me
And I never remember their names
They say if you get far enough away
You'll be on your way back home
Well I'm at the station
And I can't get on the train

It must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
With your blind love

Now the streets are turning blue
And the dogs are barking
And the night has come
And there are tears that are falling
From your blue eyes now
Well I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name
The only way to find you
Is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love

It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love

With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love

Oh it's blind love

The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh it's blind love

The Night,Morphine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morphine/thenight.html,"You're the night, Lilah
A little girl lost in the woods
You're a folktale
The unexplainable
You're a bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me

I can't make it on my own

It's too dark to see the landmarks
And I don't want your good luck charms
I hope you're waiting for me 
Across your carpet of stars
You're the night, Lilah
You're everything that we can't see
Lilah
You're the possibility

You're the bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
And I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own

Unknown the unlit world of old
You're the sounds I've never heard before
Off the map where the wild things grow
Another world outside my door
Here I stand I'm all alone
Driving down the pitch black road
Lilah you're my only home
And I can't make it on my own

You're a bedtime story 
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own",2000,sad
Sunshower,Chris Cornell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chriscornell/sunshower.html,"Dark as roses, fine as sand
Feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish
Or recollections of better days gone by

But its all right
When you're caught in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Its all right
Though your gardens grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights

But its all right
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh its all right
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Oh its all right
Though your gardens gray
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
Oh in the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sunshower

I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower
And its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today
Its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today.........",1999,sad

Just to see how it would feel
Rain after rain I stood in

Why Should I Care,Diana Krall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianakrall/whyshouldicare.html,"Was there something more I could have done? 
Or was I not meant to be the one? 
Where's the life I thought we would share? 
And should I care? 

And will someone else get more of you? 
Will she go to sleep more sure of you? 
Will she wake up knowing you're still there? 
And why should I care? 

There's always one to turn and walk away 
And one who just wants to stay 
But who said that love is always fair? 
And why should I care? 

Should I leave you alone here in the dark? 
Holding my broken heart 
While a promise still hangs in the air 
Why should I care?",1999,sad
Tuesday Morning,Melissa Etheridge,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melissaetheridge/tuesdaymorning.html,"10:03 on a Tuesday morning 
in the fall of an American dream 
a man is doing what he knows is right 
on flight 93 

Loved his mom and he loved his dad 
loved his home and he loved his man 
but on that bloody Tuesday morning 
he died and American 

[chorus]
Now you cannot change this 
You can't erase this 
You can't pretend this is not the truth 

Even though he could not marry 
Or teach your children in our schools 
Because who he wants to love 
Is breaking your God's rules 

He stood up on a Tuesday Morning 
In the terror he was brave 
And he made his choice and without a doubt 
A hundred lives he must have saved 

[chorus]

And the things you might take for granted 
Your inalienable rights 
Some might choose to deny him 
Even though he gave his life 

Can you live with yourself in the land of the free 
And make him less of a hero than the other three 
Well it might begin to change ya 
In a field in Pennsylvania

Stand up America 
Hear the bell now as it tolls 
Wake up America 
It's Tuesday Morning 
Let's roll

You're Stronger Than Me,Patsy Cline,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/patsycline/yourestrongerthanme.html,"If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory.

Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still, fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be.
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

tried to tell you
the more I tried I failed
I would not let myself believe
that you might stray
and I would stand by you
no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you
until my dying day
until my dying day
I used to think my life
was often empty
a lonely space to fill
you hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
you made my world stand still
and in that stillness
there was a freedom
I never felt before
I would not let myself believe

Oh, Honey won't you stop
Treating me that way

What love has made of me

Tell me with your eyes

How to let it slide
I swear I can see you
Coming up the drive
And there ain't nothing like regret
To remind you you're alive

I crossed the canyon a thousand times
But never noticed what was mine
What you'll remember of me tonight
Well, it almost makes me cry
Yeah, it almost makes me cry

Oh ballbreaking moon and ridiculing stars
The older I get, the closer you are
Don't you have somewhere that you need to be
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see the change in me
If you could only see
What love has made of me
But I'll forever be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see
No you won't see
The good in me

Cause babe I've changed",1998,sad
She's A Jar,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/shesajar.html,"She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A hand full of wheel
And a day off
And a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk, I sing
Wont you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil

Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a trains arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her",1998,sad
Late Goodbye,Poets of the Fall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/poetsofthefall/lategoodbye.html,"In our headlights, staring, bleak, beer cans, deer's eyes
On the asphalt underneath, our crushed plans and my lies
Lonely street signs, powerlines, they keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath hot upon my cheek, and we crossed, that line
You made me strong when I was feeling weak, and we crossed, that one time
Screaming stop signs, staring wild eyes, keep on flashing, flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair, and then we're playing hide and seek
I can't breathe easy here, less our trail's gone cold behind us
Till' in the john mirror you stare at yourself grown old and weak

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye, such a late goodbye...",2005,sad
What You're Made Of,Lucie Silvas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luciesilvas/whatyouremadeof.html,"Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
'Cause I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

[Chorus]
If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're not in love this time...but it's alright.

I hear you talking, but your words don't mean a thing
I doubt you ever put your heart into anything
It's not much to ask for, to get back what I put in
But I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want

What's your definition of the one?
What do you really want him to become?
No matter what I sacrifice it's still never enough.

Just like I predicted
I will sink before I swim
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in

If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for

And this road that I have followed

And the earth will turn below you

And something has to give
Oh something has to give

And when I build you a steeple
You say it's incomplete
'Cause you need the whole cathedral
To satisfy the need

And you're like a paper aeroplane

Flying blind through anything
Straight into the hand that chokes you

Oh something has to give

That never seems to land
Flying blind through anything

Jacob's Dream,Alison Krauss,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alisonkrauss/jacobsdream.html,"In the spring of 1856 with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
200 men had gathered there to comb the mountain side
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and erie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God

Oh mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

a thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door",ompi,sad

For to see, for to see my baby there

She was so cold, and so cool, and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she might be
Lord, you can search this whole wide world over
But she ain't never going to find another lover man like me

I want a box back coat and a stetson hat
I want a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So everybody goin' to know that I died standing pat",2003,sad
Nothing to Lose,Billy Talent,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billytalent/nothingtolose.html,"Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know
Put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone
So I became lifeless
Just like my telephone

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I'd have to check my mirror
To see if I'm still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches
Alone in the bathroom

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

Teachers said ""it's just a phase""
When I grow up my children
Will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
Who'd know it put me underground at seventeen

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

The Long Goodbye,Ronan Keating,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ronankeating/thelonggoodbye.html,"I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free (so they say)

Yeah, it sure is hard to do
And I know they say if they don't come back again
Then it's meant to be (so they say)
But those words ain't pulling me through
Cos I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill

Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
and I know without a doubt
We turned it inside out
And if we walked away
would make more sense (only self defense)
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep riding on a carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere?
(on a wing and prayer)

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?

Don't Call Me Peanut,Bayside,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bayside/dontcallmepeanut.html,"Drink up beautiful.
I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack, 
'cause I've got so much trapped 
It's all because of you. 
So I figured you might like some back.

And when I see her 
I'll tell her what's been on my mind 
all these sleepless nights. 
She'll recite her excuses 
Put my tail between these legs of mine 
like I do all the time.

I can't live my life 
knowing you'll be in his arms each time I blink my eyes. 
Know what goes on behind my back every night, 
afraid I'll never leave, 
afraid I'll never know what's good for me.

And when I see her 
I'll tell her what's been on my mind 
all these sleepless nights. 
She'll recite her excuses 
Put my tail between these legs of mine 
like I do all the time.

And now you say that, 
you say you love me. 
Well I may have your heart, 
he has your body. 
And now you swear that you're being honest, 
but you're not honest, 
and you never could be.

And when I see her 
I'll tell her what's been on my mind 
all these sleepless nights. 
She'll recite her excuses 
Put my tail between these legs of mine 
like I do all the time.",2005,sad
Mad About You,Sting,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/madaboutyou.html,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient sighs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you I'm mad about you",1991,sad
Circle,Slipknot,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/slipknot/circle.html,"Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients

Follow me (follow me)
I wish so hard I'm there again
Follow me (follow me)
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin

I know the way but I falter
Can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe

Do What I Gotta Do,Ralph Tresvant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ralphtresvant/dowhatigottado.html,"(So, so hard, girl)
(I gotta)

I'm 'bout to do this
Oh, I guess it's one of those things
A man just has to do
But I promise
It'll work out for the better, baby
Trust me

(I gotta)

I've been feeling lately
Like being single or just alone
To get into myself

Love ain't easy
Making me crazy
Games that we play
Sometimes the rules have to change

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty
So what am I gonna do?

I guess I'll do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

(Be apart, baby)
I gotta

Any good relationships starts
Inside of a happy man
I think she will understand

If I tell her straight up
Then she can only respect me
Even if we don't agree

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty, baby
So what am I gonna do?

Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Break her little heart)
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Listen, baby

Oh, sugar, no
(Do what I gotta do)
I gotta do what I gotta do

Oh, baby
(What am I gonna do?)
Oh, let me break it to you gently
I don't want to
(Do what I gotta do)

All that I can do, do
(What am I gonna do?)

Do, do, do, do, do
(Do what I gotta do)
And I don't wanna see you cry, baby
But what am I gonna do?

Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Break her little heart)
And though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Her heart, girl)
I don't wanna see you cry, baby
But you know that it's driving me crazy

Do what I gotta do
And break her heart
And though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Penny to My Name,Eva Cassidy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evacassidy/pennytomyname.html,"Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
And I was only nineteen when I had my third baby 
And sometimes I think maybe I should've left here long ago 

Travellers are stopping by, check their oil and their p.s.i. 
Gas up and away to fly, moving down the line 
But this beat-up truck & worn out shoes always give me the blues 
Billy sucking down the booze nearly every night 

[Chorus]
I never seen the city lights 
How they must shine so bright 
Not like this country night 
The sky's black as coal 
And this gas-station mountain home 
Not a thing to call my own 
How I wish I was alone 
With a penny to my name 

Strangers say this mountain here is beautiful beyond compare 
But it's just a dumb old mountain; I see it every day 
If I could see sunset skies over fields of green or ocean-tides, 
City skyline in the night, I'll be dancing till the dawn 

[Chorus]

Bill and I got married following our first born 
Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
Maybe Bill & I someday will find a chance to get away 
Until then it's here I'll stay wishing on a star

Power Trip Ballad,Maria Mena,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariamena/powertripballad.html,"The way in which I fear is solely a reflection of you,
The devastating child of the power trip you forced me through.
But how could he leave you,
Could he fuck that whore he left you for?
Get revenge;

And by all means ask your nine year old daughter to choose between you,
Don't stay friends.
Now let her in on how he's the devil,
He's just been falsely portrayed.
But force her to go stay at his house once a week
'Cause you wanna get laid,
Ha-ha-ha-ha

Ask me why he scares me,
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.

Your girl's in the bathroom washing her hands again,
Why doesn't she eat?
Her father left us
What about me?
I can't rest,
I can't sleep.

Mommy loves you
I'm just tired of you and your brother's shit.
And you know I didn't mean to hit you,
But you were asking for it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha

Ask me why she scares me.
Do you wanna know why I'm angry?
Can't you tell I'm crying?
Mother, I don't feel good.

You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.
You will always be the bitter, saddest part of me.

Looking for love in a sad song

I'm leaning on this bar listening to you sing
And your sad song rings in my ears and I start to cry

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I hear the saxophone and it tears my soul
And we're feeling old, feeling so cold
She is the torch and she is the theme
She could be a dream but - oh boy - is she real
Try to avoid her eyes, to avoid her words
They will hit you with all that you feel

She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

See her eyes they are bright tonight.
See the stars coming out tonight.
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight. 

See my eyes they are bright tonight.
See my hands reaching out tonight.
Hear my words they are dynamite
See how they light your way tonight

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong

The door is closed and you wish you could be

Friend deceives, she leaves
Last date. She cries, whispers, goodbye
She walks once more, out that door

I Don't Know You Anymore,Savage Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savagegarden/idontknowyouanymore.html,"I would like to visit you for a while
Get away and out of this city
Maybe I shouldn't have called but someone had to be the first to break
We can go sit on your back porch
Relax
Talk about anything
It don't matter
I'll be courageous if you can pretend that you've forgiven me

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

Always such relief from the winter freeze
The snow was more lonely than cold
If you know what I mean
Everyone's got an agenda, don't stop
Keep that chin up, you'll be all right
Can you believe what a year it's been
Are you still the same?
Has your opinion changed?
'Cause I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from these sentences
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I know I let you down
Again and again
I know I never really treated you right
I've paid the price
I'm still paying for it every day

So maybe I shouldn't have called
Was it too soon to tell?
Oh what the hell
It doesn't really matter
How do you redefine something that never really had a name?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed and so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain

I watched my best friend Jamie slippin' further away
I kept on waving 'till I couldn't see her

Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed, he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling, we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up Mama, she said, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And she said, How can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt, and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

Sitting with Mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes, and then squeezed my hand
She said, I have to go now, my time here is over
And with her final word, she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly, Time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same

And it showed up on my mattress
And I told myself it's better
If we only talk in letters

You broke my heart
You broke my heart

Did you think about my mother
When you shared the same bed cover
Did you wonder if it changed her
When your sons became your stranger

When will you admit your lonely
Since we split apart the family
All the pictures are updated
All of us are separated

Startin' With Me,Jake Owen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jakeowen/startinwithme.html,"I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline

I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck when she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell

And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed when the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma died

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog

I'd look back and not like what I see

Dance With My Father,Luther Vandross,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luthervandross/dancewithmyfather.html,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved?
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",2003,sad

Forever left untold
I still remember the tears that you shed
Over someone else

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

There is a light down at memory lane
Slowly fading away
Still holding on to the dreams torn apart
I will follow my heart

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

Still on my own, chasing the sun
Of a time long ago
The shade in my heart, tearing apart
Everything that I long for

I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Whispering my name

A Little Rain,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/alittlerain.html,"The Ice Man's mule is parked
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the buthcer's son
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one

They're dancing on the roof
And the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it wurth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one

The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride

She was 15 years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was, ""I love you mom.""

And a little rain
Never hurt no one
And a little rain
Never hurt no one",1992,sad
Song to Sing When I'm Lonely,John Frusciante,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnfrusciante/songtosingwhenimlonely.html,"A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again
No one to face when I'm falling
Holding tight to dreams that never end
I'll be you
I do
I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyones reason
Everything dying and leaving
Out with these faults and you make me a baby
Faking an movement by no ones seeing it
No one always find peace flung
No one chooses to beat my pride down
Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up
Sunlight to fate accumalates
Loving pain to be clung to
By lumimous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong
And true to us
Out of place in my own time
Drowning thinkin that I'm dry
Holding on to facts that'll never be proven
Faking an action cus no one's looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feeling nothing when my life's flashing before my eyes
You should've threw me down
Is the content so much",2003,sad
You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/youllneverleaveharlanalive.html,"In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive

Oh, my granddad's dad walked down 
Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth
Of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
'Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I'll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive

Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west 
Of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling 
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave

In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive",2001,sad
Torch Song,The Walkmen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/walkmen/torchsong.html,"If I had known the graceful song I should know
To slow down all the madness, I would have sung
A whispered melody to calm you and keep you close

But I don't know the tune
It's a burden on my sorry soul
No, I don't have a clue
It's a weight upon my empty skull

If I was soundly sleeping, I'd fall into dreams
But the night time's stale and restless, it's all wrong for me.
The night time's stale and restless, it's all wrong for me.

I don't know the tune
It's a burden on my sorry soul
No I don't have a clue
A weight upon my empty skull.",2010,sad
Don't Think I Don't Think About It,Darius Rucker,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dariusrucker/dontthinkidontthinkaboutit.html,"I left out in a cloud of tail lights and dust
Swore I wasn't comin' back
Said I'd had enough

Fadin' from my life
But I wasn't turnin' round
No not this time

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me

Heard ya found a real good man and ya married him

Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away

Ruby and Carlos,James McMurtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmcmurtry/rubyandcarlos.html,"Ruby said you're gettin' us in a world of hurt
â¨And down below the Mason Dumb Ass line the food gets worse
â¨I can't go back to Tennesseeâ¨That NASCAR country's not for meâ¨
Go on if you think you must

â¨â¨Carlos packed his drums up in the dark of night
â¨Ruby standing just outside the front porch light
â¨Chain-smoking Camel straights
The sky off to the East got grey
â¨And he rolled off in a cloud of dustâ¨â¨

The grey colt nickered at the gateâ¨
She said ""you're right it's gettin' lateâ¨
You and me got work to doâ¨
We can't be burning daylight too""â¨
She took down the long lead ropeâ¨
And stayed off that slippery slope

â¨â¨The aspen trees were turning gold up topâ¨
The talk was buzzing round the beauty shopâ¨
""Wasn't he barely half her age?""
â¨""Well that's just how they do nowadays
â¨We should all a'been so lucky""â¨â¨

By spring she'd had the run of all the freeborn men
â¨Ruby turned fifty in a sheep camp tent
â¨Her body still could rock all nightâ¨
But her heart was closed and locked up tight
â¨Potato fields all muddy and brownâ¨
The gossip long since quieted downâ¨â¨

After one more Coggins test
â¨Pouring coffee for the county vet

â¨â¨Pictures on the ice box doorâ¨
Of Carlos in the first Gulf Warâ¨
Black eyed, brown and youthful faceâ¨
Smiling back from a Saudi baseâ¨â¨

Then Carlos on the big bay mareâ¨
Heavier now and longer haired
â¨Looking past the saddle shed
â¨From way on back inside his headâ¨â¨

The old vet said one day Rube
â¨That colt will break an egg in you
Now and then one comes along
â¨You just can't ride then he went on homeâ¨â¨

The storm door didn't catch
â¨It blew back hardâ¨As she struck a match
â¨But she cupped it just in time
â¨Then she sent that ash tray flyingâ¨â¨(

[Chorus:]
Holding back the floodâ¨
Just don't do no goodâ¨
You can't unclench your teeth
To howl the way you should
â¨So you curl your lips aroundâ¨
The taste of tears and a hollow sound
That no one owns but you
â¨No one owns but youâ¨â¨

Carlos took the road gig and he saw it through
â¨He rode the tour bus while the singer flew
â¨Managed out of Music Rowâ¨
Carlos never saw the studioâ¨
Session guys had that all sewn upâ¨â¨

He looks out the window as it starts to sleet
â¨Layinâ on a friend's couch on Nevada Street
â¨Lately he's been staying high
Sick all winter and they don't know why
â¨They don't know why or they just won't sayâ¨
They don't talk much down at the VAâ¨â¨

Ruby's in his thoughts sometimes
â¨What thoughts can get out past the wine
â¨He feels her fingers on his brow
â¨And right then he misses how
â¨She looked in that grey morning light
â¨She never shaved like they all do now
He sees it all behind his eyes
â¨His hands go searching but they come up dryâ¨â¨

Halfway in that waking dreamâ¨
Carlos lets the land line ringâ¨â¨

He'd never have guessed it was Ruby calling
â¨A pin in her hip from the grey colt falling
â¨Figure eights in a lazy lope
â¨Stumbled on that slippery slope

â¨â¨[Chorus]",2008,sad
Do You Dream at All,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/doyoudreamatall.html,"When you crawl into bed
You pull the covers a bit too tight
Get drunk and lay your head on my pillow
Mute and white
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
It's always those black black circles around your eyes
Darker still
Such dead slumber will get you nowhere in the end
So do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you wish someone was there to rock you to sleep?
And hold you near?
Well, that won't be me.
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do

No Joy in Mudville,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/nojoyinmudville.html,"Last night I dreamt that I was you. I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude.
Such a pose I could simply not hold through days in a northern town that I had once called a home.
Your studies of fringe New York streets... I was reading the pavement in every work you would speak.
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
Buying drinks for the poets upstate, this southern corrupting towed you down the interstate,
And they all said that you were the king of gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would speak.
This town simply cannot compete so I'm packing my Bullets and Silverstones
And heading east to a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on...
If I could have (had) my way this year would bridge '66 (again?)
Trust fund hipsters were casing the room chock full of amphetamines.
The overturned kick drum book set the pace with incomparable cool.
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you...",2000,sad
The Right Man,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/therightman.html,"So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give his bride away

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man

Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child

My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own

Here I go

Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew a right man

Well I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance

Ohh

Well I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance

And one day my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man",2006,sad
Crying in the Chapel,Elvis Presley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elvispresley/cryinginthechapel.html,"You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees

Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way",1967,sad
Songs About Rain,Gary Allan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garyallan/songsaboutrain.html,"Well this town has closed down way too early, 
And there's nothing to do,
So I'm driving around in circles, 
And I'm thinking about you,
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way,
And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain
Now there's all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car, 
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like,

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain,
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not,
Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I'll never know what could have been,
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in,
If their gonna keep on playing me songs like, 

Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, 
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there's no two the same,

Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain,
All these songs about rain,
Songs about rain.......",2003,sad

Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there

I don't wanna say
Goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh, let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

Cold, lonely summer

Saving All My Love for You,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/savingallmyloveforyou.html,"A few stolen moments is all that we share 
You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone 
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own 
But each time I try I just break down and cry 
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
So I'm saving all my love for you 

You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy 

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door 

'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love 
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you 

No other woman is gonna love you more 
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through

Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

how do i explain that smile 
and how it turns my world around 
keeping my feet on the ground

i will soothe you if you fall 
i'll be right there if you call 
you're my greatest love of all

I Stopped to Fill My Car Up,Stereophonics,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stereophonics/istoppedtofillmycarup.html,"I stopped to fill my car up
The car felt good that day
I didn't know where I was going
But it felt good for a change
A five and a pocket full of silver
I paid the lady no change
And then it started to piss down
I started driving again

And then I looked up
And looked in the mirror behind me

A man round forty in the back seat
Must have stepped in when I was empty
So why's he sat there just waiting
Likely to smash my face in

He had a bag full of money
He said just drive me away
I didn't know where I was going
Yet it felt good to be strange

And still I look up
And look in the mirror behind me

Curiosity is over
He stepped down from the car
He pulled a gun out from his jacket
Said I was going to die

It gives me so much satisfaction
To watch you beg and cry
Well I just made up this story
To get your attention makes me smile

I never looked up or looked
In the mirror behind me",1999,sad

Set me free, darling, rescue me

Every cross that we bear

Song for You,Alexi Murdoch,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aleximurdoch/songforyou.html,"So today I wrote a song for you 
Cause a day can get so long 
And I know it's hard to make it through 
When you say there's something wrong 

So I'm trying to put it right 
Cause I want to love you with my heart 
All this trying has made me tired 
And I don't know even where to start 

Maybe that's a start 

For you know it's a simple game 
That you play filling up your head with rain 
And you know you've been hiding from your pain 
In the way, in the way you say your name 

And I see you 
Hiding your face in your hands 
Flying so you won't land 
You think no one understands 
No one understands 

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head 
And your throat is aching but you swear 
No one hurts you, nothing could be sad 
Anyway you're not here enough to care 

And you're so tired you don't sleep at night 
As your heart is trying to mend 
You keep it quiet but you think you might 
Disappear before the end 

And it's strange how you cannot find 
Any strength to even try 
To find a voice to speak your mind 
When you do, all you wanna do is cry 

Well maybe you should cry 

And I see you hiding your face in your hands 
Talking 'bout far-away lands 
You think no one understands 
Listen to my hands 

And all of this life 
Moves around you 
For all that you claim 
You're standing still 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
I will move with you",2006,sad
The Curse,Josh Ritter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joshritter/thecurse.html,"He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight
With the girl in the doorway
What beautiful lines and how full of life
After thousands of years what a face to wake up to
He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm
She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping
And under miles of stone, the dried fig of his heart
Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating

She carries him home in a beautiful boat
He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage
He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed
And one day his lips answer her in her own language
The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh
The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches
She asks, âAre you cursed?â He says, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes

In New York he is laid in a glass covered case
He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him
But each night she comes round and the two wander down
The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum
Often he stops to rest but then less and less
Then it's her that looks tired staying up asking questions
He learns how to read from the papers that she
Is writing about him and he makes corrections

It's his face on her book more and more come to look
Families from Iowa, upper west siders
Then one day it's too much he decides to get up
And as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her
She's using a cane and her face looks too pale
But she's happy to see him as they walk he supports her
She asks, âAre you cursed?â but his answer's obscured
In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters

Such reanimation the two tour the nation
He gets out of limos he meets other women
He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum
But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him
She stops going out she just lies there in bed
In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking
Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold
And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating

Long ago on the ship she asked, âWhy pyramids?â
He said, âThink of them as an immense invitationâ
She asked, âAre you cursed?â He said, âI think that I'm curedâ
Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question",2010,sad

See You At The Show,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/seeyouattheshow.html,"Crowds that scream at superstars
Where bouncers show they're battle scars

What Went Wrong,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/whatwentwrong.html,"[tom]
I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah

I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in it's plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong [x4]

Tell me, did your shadow trip an' fall,
Over you, babe, movin' that slowly?
Did you think you could waste my time,
Come a-messin' round with my mind?
Did you think you could? You don't know me.
Where'd you get that alibi?
Did it fall out of a midnight sky,
Or did you find it on the side of the road?
Tell me: Did you have to make a deal,
Or wrestle for control, of the wheel, from your conscience?
I'd like to know,
Where do you go,
On your way home?

You know, someday, I'd like to fly,
Like a bat outta Nashville. Why don't you help me?
An' tell me the truth.
'Cause the truth is gonna set you free.
If you keep on lyin' to me, I might stay right here,
Just to spite you.

Fool,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/fool.html,"Apartment in New York, London and Paris
Where will we rest, we're all living on top of it
It's all that we have the USA our daily bread
And no one is willing to share it

Why can't we see our fortunancy
Living as legends have lived
Bane and dismannered
We coax all the time
Knowing that nothing is left when we die

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent

Wanting to live and laugh all the time
Sitting alone with you tea and your crime
Children with kids and people with parents
Any which way there's no past and no present
When the day comes and all of them bums
Will reveal enchanting persons

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent

When it's a rut and baby's no luck
Half of it's misunderstanding love
The war we have won we're winning again
Within ourselves and within our friends

Come along Fool,
A direct hit to the sense you're disconnected
It's not that it's bad, it's not that it's death
It's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent",2003,sad
I Won't See You Tonight Part 1,Avenged Sevenfold,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avengedsevenfold/iwontseeyoutonightpart1.html,"Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, 
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. 
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition
This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things
I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken
You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you I knew god's face was handsome
With you I saw final expansion
This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything
I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe
I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together

Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes 
You told me we could still be friends 
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies

Why I'm not around

Remember waiting there to find nothing at all

To make it up to you

Redemption,Frank Turner,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/frankturner/redemption.html,"I was walking home to my house through the snow from the station
When the Springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question
Oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption?
Or are we all merely biding our time down to lonely conclusions?
Darling let me take your hand as I talk you through this
How loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis
Lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on tape hiss
With my feelings laid clear on the ceiling
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can do this

Well I tried so hard to not turn into my father
But if I only ever skip all his choices will I ever choose better?
Oh the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener
So I left you alone in a restaurant in London in winter
You deserved better

Adam Trask is on my back and in my ears
And the sound comes clear and brings the awful truth
That I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary
Today should have been our anniversary
And I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can't escape
I only ever have myself to blame

These failures shift and shake me in the night
Like a fever I can't break try as I might
Wake me darling I need you take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine, and mine alone

So if each of us is made up of a tally of mistakes and successes
Then my hour in that restaurant makes my score less than impressive
But each can be redeemed with the courage with which he confesses
So darling I miss you, your music and your musk and your kisses
I don't think I can do this",2011,sad

But thou ne'er step'st aside
And I'm trapp'd, I'm trapp'd
A distance there is

None, save me and the bodkin
Pitter-patter on the roof
Behold! - 'tis not the rain
Thence me it has to be
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocence
Yet thou let'st thy lass into peril
Thou let'st me be parched

My heart is of frailty
My pale skin is hued damask

When thou thy tears hast hidden
""Come back!"", thou sayest
There I soon am to be
But how am I to run when my bones, my heart
Thou hast me bereaft
But run thou sayest
I run...

And there and then I behold that a time will come
When I again dead will be
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay
I leave...

Oh, I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk

In my mind in which is this event
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?

After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world
All the beautiful moments shared, deliberately push'd aside

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing
And laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again

So I lay my head back down

To be only yours
I pray to be only yours

Why did you go? I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait? Will you wait?
Will I see you again?

You took it with you when you left
These scars are just a trace
Now it wanders lost and wounded
This heart that I misplaced

Where are you now?
Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone?
Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?
Why did you go? I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait? Will you wait?
Will I see you again?",2011,sad
Promise to Try,Madonna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madonna/promisetotry.html,"Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try -- it's not the same

Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss -- kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on -- but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try",1989,sad
I Will Love Again,Lara Fabian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/larafabian/iwillloveagain.html,"Did I ever tell you how you live in me
Every waking moment, even in my dreams
And if all this talk is crazy
And you don't know what I mean
Does it really matter
Just as long as I believe
[Chorus:]
I will love again
Though my heart is breaking, I will 
love again
Stronger than before
I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows, I will love again
People never tell you
The way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly
If I knew it was for real
So if all this talk sounds crazy
And the words don't come out right
Does it really matter
If it gets me through this night
[Chorus]
If I'm true to myself, nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on, tell me what else can I do
[Chorus]
I will love again
One day I know, I will love again
You can't stop me from loving again, breathing again
Feeling again
I know, one day, I'll love again",1999,sad
Little Rock,Collin Raye,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/collinraye/littlerock.html,"Well, I know I disappeared a time or two,
and along the way I lost me and you.
I needed a new town for my new start
selling VCR's in Arkansas at a Wal-Mart.

I haven't had a drink in nineteen days.
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze.
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ.
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

I don't know why I held it all inside,
you must've thought I never even tried.
You know your daddy told me when I left
that Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

Lying here upon this motel bed,
my thoughts of you explode inside my head.
Like a castle built upon the sand,
I let love crumble in my hand.

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see.
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock,
without you, baby I'm not me.

Without you, baby I'm not me...

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock.",1994,sad

Oh, Romeo is bleeding to death..
To see a friend bleed to death
What for, some kind of metaphor
That I can't see..
So I'll drink until I see it.

So I'll give up on you,
I'll give up on this.
This sky will make me sick,
So I'll give up on this,
I'll give up on you.

Archers in your arches,
Raise your fingers for one last salute..
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine.

So you want to hold me up and bring me down?
Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down

Or the way you want me more than I want you.
I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you.

You can have your conscience all you want
You can't say I do nothing yeah
I put it off

Will there be someone left to sing your blues?
Where you gonna run when they come for you?
Will there be someone to sing your blues?",2007,sad
Don't Take the Girl,Tim McGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timmcgraw/donttakethegirl.html,"Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate holdin' a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go but someday you'll change your mind
And Johnny said ""Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm said ""If you do what I tell you to, there won't be any harm"" 
And Johnny said ""Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's going to be a little one and she says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fading fast and Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please don't take the girl

Sally's Pigeons,Cyndi Lauper,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cyndilauper/sallyspigeons.html,"When I was eight I had a friend
With a pirate smile
Make believe and play pretend
We were innocent and wild
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate
Running down my alleyway
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly

We loved to watch them dive and soar 
Circle in the sky
Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly

I had a fool's confidence
That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities

My heart began to
Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
In tears she told me she was late
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...

On the dresser sits a frame 
With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly
She never saw those birds again
And me, I can't remember when 
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry
I close my eyes
And Sally's pigeons fly...",1993,sad
I Look to You,Whitney Houston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitneyhouston/ilooktoyou.html,"As I lay me down,
Heaven hear me now.
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all.

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun.
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

About to lose my breath,
There's no more fighting left,
Sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door.

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret.
And I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you.
I look to you.
And when all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

My levees are broken
My walls have come
Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling.
Defeat is calling.
I need you to set me free.

Take me far away from the battle.
I need you.
Shine on me.

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.",2009,sad
She Thinks His Name Was John,Reba McEntire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rebamcentire/shethinkshisnamewasjohn.html,"She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then

But there is one she can't put her fingers on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams

And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John",1994,sad
What I'd Say,Gary Allan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garyallan/whatidsay.html,"Talkin' to the mirror, whispering your name
It's just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say

There's time I've been so angry
I could put my fist right through the wall
And then there's times I've come so close
To givin' you a call
I love you and I hate you
All at the same time
Then I pray you'll come back to me
Before I lose my mind

How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell

I Can Still Make Cheyenne,George Strait,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgestrait/icanstillmakecheyenne.html,"Her telephone rang  'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.

He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

[Chorus:]
She said, ""Don't bother comin' home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind",1996,sad
Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes,George Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/whosgonnafilltheirshoes.html,"You know this old world is full of singers

A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee

Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball

God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And old Go Cat Go still echoes through the years

You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell when hew sings I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

And too cold at home.

Well, that baseball game on TV
Takes me back to when I was a kid
We proudly wore those uniforms
Just like the Dodgers did
Yea!, we won a few and and we lost a few
And for me it still goes on
Too hot to fish, and too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

Well, I only planned on one or two
I might stay for three
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner
Keeps smilin' back at me
It's so easy not to care
'Bout what's right or what's wrong
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf
And too cold at home.

And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
Where do you think you're going
I think you don't know
You got no way of knowing
You got no place to go

I understand your changes
How long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going
I know what you came here for
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going
I think you'd better go with me, girl

You say there is no reason
But you still find cause to doubt me
When you ain't with me girl
You're gonna be without me

Where do you think you're going
Don't you know it's dark outside
Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going
I think you'd better go with me, girl",1979,sad
The Fourth Drink Instinct,Cute Is What We Aim For,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cuteiswhatweaimfor/thefourthdrinkinstinct.html,"She's doesn't deserve to be in a place like this
All alone
She's underage and so very very brave
A fake ID lent her credibility
She sits at the bar
The gents are gonna try so hard

He said it was a one night stand
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
A one night stand

So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark

So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned
Says, ""Girlie girlie, you're at your best (you're at your best) when you're sober""
And she slurs, ""No no, just one more""
And one turns into four
The fourth drink instinct is taking over
And the gentleman is leading her towards the door

So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark

She thought that she could buy happiness by
By the bottle
She thought that she could buy happiness by
By the bottle
She thought that she could buy happiness by
By the bottle

So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily

My Eyes Burn,Matchbook Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matchbookromance/myeyesburn.html,"My eyes burn from these tears
You'd think I'd learn over these years
Good things won't last forever

So what the hell am I supposed to do
You only wanted the things I couldn't give to you
And you had it all anyway

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

Tell me I'm wrong when I say
I can't expect you to spend forever with me
I live for that single moment

I take back everything I've said
You wore those words on your lips
As if they meant anything anyway

Sometimes I feel I could drop off the face of the earth
It seems I do more harm than good
And I don't know if it's worth me losing sleep over this

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

Tell me I'm wrong when I say it
I can't expect you to spend forever with me
I live for that single moment

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place

You're Not From Here,Lara Fabian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/larafabian/yourenotfromhere.html,"I don't know what is going on
You turn around and touch my heart
A silent moment speaks the truth
Something has happened all at once
It should have scared me in advance
But I was falling in those eyes of yours
And so
Fear was gone
I knew there was nothing else 
I'd ever want
[Chorus:]
I know you
You're not from here
I've waited for you to appear
To take my breath away
And make me weep
You're not from here
Not from this here and now
Just a touch of yours
And I fly... and I fly... and I fly
I can't get used to missing you
If this is how it's gotta be
I need an angel to watch over me
No one can hold the hands of time
But I can hold you in my mind
Over and over like a melody
For now
I'll stand still
For now
I'll be filled by the memory of your skin
I know you
You're not from here
You don't belong to lies and tears
The greatness of your soul
Makes me weep
You're not from here
Not from this here and now
Just a touch of yours
And I fly... and I fly... and I fly

Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donelljones/whereiwannabe.html,"[Verse 1]
I said I left my baby girl a message 
Sayin' I won't be coming home 
I'd rather be alone 
She doesn't fully understand me 
That I'd rather leave than to cheat 
If she gives me some time 
I can be the man she needs 
But there's a lot of lust inside of me 
And we've been together since our teenage years 
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time 
To be alone 

[Chorus 1]
But when you love someone 
You just don't treat them bad 
Oh, how I feel so sad 
Now that I wanna leave 
She's crying her heart to me 
How could you let this be? 
I just need time to see 
Where I wanna be 
Where I wanna be... 

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee... 
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no... 

[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine 
That you would play a major part 
In a decision that's so hard 
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go? 
I think about my life and what matters to me the most 
Girl, the love that we share is real 
But in time your heart will heal 
I'm not saying I'm gone 
But I have to find what life is like 
Without you 

[Chorus 1]

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee... 
I don't mean to hurt you, baby

See when you love someone 
You just don't treat them bad

Johnny Wanna Live,Sandra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandra/johnnywannalive.html,"I got something on my mind
Makes me sad and makes my cry - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Just an ordinary day
An animal will pass away - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Who's to say he got no rights
Even not a right to life
Don't know why it leaves you cold
Don't know how to make it show - oh no
Johnny wanna live
Johnny wanna live

Got to give his skin away
For coats they wear on summerdays - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Beauty aid and all the rest
Come directly from a test - oh no
Johnny wanna live

Through his eyes I look inside his heart
He can feel like me and you
Can't defend himself cause he can't talk
And this is why I talk you

Johnny isn't just a name
He stands for every creature's pain - oh no
Johnny wanna live
Johnny wanna live

Go and try to look inside his heart
You can find your own mistakes
Try to hide them thinking he can't talk
But he can read them in your face

I got something on my mind
It makes me sad
And it makes me cry - oh no
Let him live

Tell me why it leaves you cold
I swear
I'm gonna make it show - oh no

Castle Down,Emilie Autumn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/emilieautumn/castledown.html,"You can see that I swim
Through the sea of painful
You have watched as I pulled 
Myself from the floor

And you were there when I 
Built my tower like pebbles in the rain
Trying to balance all that I had left
With what I didn't have any more

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

You seem so devoted
Your love is unconditional
You were self-promoted
I never asked you

You were my everything
My apparitional faith
Where are you when I am
Screaming to my god what am I coming to

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

If I had another place to go
Would you break me, is it that you know
I have no choice but to rebuild again
I'm tied so hard I can't remember when 
I last walked free upon these feet of mine

But I'll draw the line
There will come a time
When I am stronger
Your words won't hurt any longer

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

And would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left
'Til there is nothing, nothing left
'Til there is nothing left

A Kiss Without Commitment,Daniel Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielbedingfield/akisswithoutcommitment.html,"[Bonus Track]

A kiss without commitment's
Like a flower without the rain
It only leads to pain
And it fills my heart with emptiness
Your touch without commitment's
Like a calm before the storm
The tears are starting to form in my eyes

When I kissed you I was curious
The child that I was
I never realised I would love you so
And in the magic of the moment
I was swept to the side
And I saw your heart
So small and tender

Physical is fine
But I cannot avoid the pain
I'm like an express train
As I surge towards the mountains
I am certain as I'm livin'
I cannot do this again
We're much too greater friends
To play games

When I kissed you it was
Everything I dreamed it would be
But I never dreamed it would mean so much to me
And our friendship is too valuable to carelessly lose
So today I choose
To really love you

Jessica your heart is
Like a newly budding rose
Expanding as she grows
Your petals have been bruised
But you have so much love to give
And it's so beautiful to see
You're beautiful to me, my friend

And when I kissed you
I believed it wouldn't get in the way
I want to stay your friend and have it fine
And I'm hoping that our God can make great things of our lives
His love survives
The greatest struggles

Jessica your gate is open, nothing in your way
A friend you'll always stay to me
Whatever else we're gonna be
A friend
You'll always stay to me",2004,sad

But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six weeks went by
Still pretending that I'm fine
It was you and I
Holding back what's on our minds

And all the things I should have said
And all the letters left unsent
It was you and I
But mostly me

Lost in you
And I can't find myself again
Lost in you
And I can't find myself again

Six months went by
I almost forgot your face
Till they played that song tonight
The one we used to hate

Lost in you

Everything I Build,The Stills,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stills/everythingibuild.html,"The tide is high

You got room to grow

You can never look up
You can't ever look down
You get kicked around

And I built it with rock
I built it with all of the
Things that I'm not
And I watch from the hill
As it burns to the ground
I can still see the smoke 
From my train out of town

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

I close my eyes
Scared of what I saw
Are you mad at all?
Been an open book
Been a slamming door
Apple of the trojan war

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

Drink a little bit
Dance a little bit
Take a chance 
I lose it all
I have no remorse no regrets
When I'm hanging from 
This seventeenth floor

The tide is high
Never been so low
You got room to grow

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down",2008,sad

I feel like cryin'
I feel like cryin'

Then I close my eyes
And I search the skies
For a sign of you thinking of me
Then I feel you here
You are oh so near
In my mind I find you next to me

Cause once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain

There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much

Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere

And everytime I think we're over and done you do something to get me back loving you.
And you got me just torn.

[Chorus:]
Torn in between the two. (Oh yeah)
Cuz I really wanna be with you.
But something's telling me I should leave you alone. (I really want to be with you)
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone.
And you got me just torn in between the two. (In between the two)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (Be with you)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone. (You alone)
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone.

[Verse 2:]
There were no issues when we started out.
It was cool.
It was everything that love's about.
But something happened.
Plus I'm feeling so burnt out.
(Cuz I can't understand you now.) Now oh
(I just can't understand you now.)
A part of me says it's all my fault.
A part of me says ""he ain't what you want.""
A part of me says to get my bags.
A part of me says I can't do that.

[Pre-Chorus:]
A part of me wants to leave.
But a part of me wants to be here with you.
And everytime I think that it's over and done you make me fall back in love.
You got me just torn.

[Chorus:]
Torn in between the two. (Between the two)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (Be with you)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone.(You alone)
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone.
And you got me just torn in between the two. (Torn in between the two)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (Really wanna be with you)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone. (Telling me I should leave)
Leave you alone. (Alone)
Leave you alone. (Alone)

[Bridge:]
So many times I... (I was ready to go)
So many times I... (Had my foot out the door)
So many times I... (I thought to give him a chance, thought he'd be a better man)
Now I'm sitting here and I'm so confused.
Cuz I keep fighting myself for you. (I don't know how much more I can take but I can't feel this way)
(You got me so torn)

[Chorus:]
Torn in between the two. (Oh yeah)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (I really wanna be with you)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone.
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone. (But I don't know)
And you got me just torn in between the two. (Should I stay or should I go)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (I don't know)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone. (You alone)
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone. (You alone)

And you got me just torn in between the two. (I'm torn in between the two)
Cuz I really wanna be with you. (I really wanna be with you)
But something's telling me I should leave you alone. (But I don't know)
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone.

[Repeat 3X]
And you got me just torn in between the two.
Cuz I really wanna be with you.
But something's telling me I should leave you alone.
Leave you alone.
Leave you alone.",2006,sad
There's No Me Without You,Toni Braxton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/theresnomewithoutyou.html,"There's no me without you
There's no meaning to life without you
Tell me why should I care
'Bout doing my hair
When I can't stop thinking about you?

There's no moon without you
There's no Saturday nights without you
There's no walk through the park
No beat in my heart
No, I love you, no, I can't live without you

You told me everything would be cool
Said I wouldn't always feel blue
How come I feel like a wreck?
How come the skies are all grey
How come my eyes are all red?
Why am I alone in my bed?

You told me everything would be fine
Why am I losing my mind?
How come I feel like a fool?
Why do I keep losing you?
Why do I love in despair
When you're not there?

There's no me without you
There's no meaning to life without you
Tell me why should I care
'Bout doing my hair
When I can't stop thinking about you?

There's no moon without you
There's no Saturday nights without you
There's no walk through the park
No beat in my heart
No, I love you, no, I can't live without you

So blue for you
So deep in love with you
So hard to say ""Bye-bye""
When you know how hard I've tried
I, I, I tried baby
No no no no

You told me everything would be fine
Why am I losing my mind?
How come I feel like a fool?
Why do I keep losing you?
Why do I love in despair?
When you're not there

There's no me without you
There's no meaning to life without you
Tell me why should I care

Hurts The Most,Monica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monica/hurtsthemost.html,"[Verse 1:]
Boy its been a long time,
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothings changed
Since weâve been together
I must admit that Iâm still crazy âbout you
And I can see it in your eyes
That thereâs something you wanna say to me
Cuzz usually right now youâd be holding on to me
But instead youâre telling meâ¦.

[Bridge:]
That things have changed
Theyâre not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

[Chorus:]
And baby what hurts the most
Is letting go
I just want you to know
That I love you so
And though things are different now
Youâve gone and settled down
I thought for sure youâd always wait for me
Iâll tell you what hurts the most
Is that I shouldâve took the chance
Boy when you come to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought, Iâd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love
And oh how Iâm missin you now

[Verse 2:]
I hate that thereâs someone new
Cominâ in and taking my place
Doin things that we used to do
And making love to youâ¦â¦.no
What am I supposed to do
Itâs killing me cuzz I want you
And you shouldâve know my love was true
And thereâs no one else in this world for me but you

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I know that Iâm the one to blame for losing you
Oh yeahâ¦
I really really wish that I could be happy for you
Thereâs just one thing I need you to do
Donât you touch her like you used to touch me
Donât you love her like you really needed me
Donât you love her like you used to love me

What hurts the most
Is letting go
Just let you know
I love you so",2003,sad

Looks like I got you off of my mind

Turns a flicker to a flame

Never Is a Promise,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/neverisapromise.html,"You'll never see the courage I know
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

But as the scenery grows
I see in different lights
The shades and shadows
Undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch
I see from greater heights
I understand what I am
Still too proud to mention
To you

You'll say you understand
But you don't understand
You'll say you'd never give up
Seeing eye to eye
But never is a promise
And you can't afford to lie

You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown
To you

You'll say don't fear your dreams
It's easier than it seems
You'll say you'd never
Let me fall from hopes so high
But never is a promise
And you can't afford to lie

You'll never live
This life that I live
I'll never live the life
That wakes me in the night

You'll never hear
The message I give
You'll say it looks as though
I might give up this fight

But as the scenery grows
I see in different lights
The shades and shadows
Undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch
I see from greater heights
I realise what I am now
Too smart to mention
To you

You'll say you understand
You'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up
Knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in
You don't know who I am
You'll say I need appeasing
When I start to cry
But never is a promise
And I'll never need a lie",1996,sad
Need You Now,Lady Antebellum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ladyantebellum/needyounow.html,"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Oh, whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without

Beautiful,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/beautiful.html,"[Spoken]
Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down...oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go
(And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(The sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side

We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today

Oh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh

Hey There Delilah,Plain White T's,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/plainwhitets/heytheredelilah.html,"Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there, Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me",P:  ,sad
Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/teardropsonmyguitar.html,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Better Than Me,Hinder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hinder/betterthanme.html,"I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend... I won't think about you when I'm older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I had ever learned

Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,âshut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you

People Ain't No Good,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/peopleaintnogood.html,"People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veil

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all

To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good

It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'll stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit baby
People just ain't no good

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all",1997,sad
Shadow of the Day,Linkin Park,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/linkinpark/shadowoftheday.html,"I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away

Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay

Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you",2007,sad
Shadow,Britney Spears,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/britneyspears/shadow.html,"Your bodyâs warm
But you are not
You give a little
Not a lot
You coup your love
Until we kiss
Youâre all I want
But not like this
Iâm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

Itâs only your shadow
Never yourself
Itâs only your shadow
Nobody else
Itâs only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isnât mine
Your laughter it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

Itâs only your shadow
Never yourself
Itâs only your shadow
Nobody else
Itâs only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

How can I tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
Iâm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

Itâs only your shadow
Never yourself
Itâs only your shadow
Nobody else
Itâs only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
Itâs only your shadow

Nobody else
Itâs only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon

The Rip,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/therip.html,"As she walks in the room
Scented and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realise that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?",2008,sad
Brothers on a Hotel Bed,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/brothersonahotelbed.html,"You may tire of me as our December sun is setting because I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for: both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 

On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still reside. 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea like navy men 
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 

You may tire of me
As our December sun is setting
Because I'm not who I used to be",2005,sad
Bad Day,Daniel Powter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielpowter/badday.html,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Turns us in to compromise

Runaway Train,Soul Asylum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulasylum/runawaytrain.html,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really lead myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mysteries seem so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same",1992,sad

Me and a Gun,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/meandagun.html,"5 am
Friday morning
Thursday night
Far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home
Obviously
So I'll just change direction
Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live

Got a full tank and some chips
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang ""holy holy"" as he buttoned down his pants
You can laugh
It's kind of funny things you think
At times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

Yes I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread
For you, your friends, your father, Mr. Ed

Me and a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back
Used to hang and he said
""It's your choice babe just remember
I don't think you'll be back in 3 days time
So you choose well""
Tell me what's right
Is it my right to be on my stomach
Of Fred's Seville

Me and a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet
These things go through you head
When there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach
It's not a classic Cadillac

Me and a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this",1992,sad

With some help from Johnnie Walker Red
Send the poison rain
Down the drain
To put bad thoughts in my head

With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?

A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong
Hardly ever wrong
I said, ""Man, you're mean.""

You had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I've seen
In a magazine
That you'd left lying around

I don't have you with me
But I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?

I know you'd rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway

Next door the TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy
Of errors, you see
It's about taking a fall

To vanish into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I try to be
But you know me
I come back when you want me to

Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?",,sad
Comfortable,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/comfortable.html,"I just remembered, that time at the market
snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
you looked behind you to smile back at me
crashed into a rack full of magazines
they asked us if we could leave.

Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in

I sleep with this new girl i'm still getting used to
my friends all approve, say she's gonna be good for you
they throw me, high fives

She says the bible is all that she reads
and prefers that I not use profanity
your mouth was, so dirty

Life of the party
and she swears that she's artsy
but you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in
she's perfect, so flawless
or so they say, say

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin'
and poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in
she's perfect, so flawless

Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near.

Lay me down, the lie will unfurl

Don't go and lose your face

It makes me see what I want to see

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because (it) brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here? 
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?

The more I cry, the more I cry
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try
Try

All of the moments that already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be
And that's wonderful, and that's life
And that's you, baby
This is me, baby
And we are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love
We are free in our love",2003,sad
Russian Roulette,Rihanna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rihanna/russianroulette.html,"Uh, uh [sound of taking breath]

Take a breath
Take it deep
'Calm yourself', he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now
Moving slow
No time to think. My turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So, just pull the trigger (trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says 'close your eyes, sometimes it helps'
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here - means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
No, You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So, just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
No, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no
Know that I must pass this test

Some other place
I'm getting by 
In other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear
Is coming true
Try to justify the things
I used to do
Believe in you 

Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
And i am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you

I tried to stay away
You know  
Just in case
I've come to realize
We all have our place
Time has a way you know 
To make it clear
I have my role in this
I can't disappear
Or leave you here

Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
And i am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Are waving goodbye
I am staying right beside you",2008,sad

Tears and Rain,James Blunt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesblunt/tearsandrain.html,"How I wish I could surrender my soul
Shed the clothes that become my skin
See the liar that burns within my needing
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold
How I wish I had screamed out loud
Instead I've found no meaning

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind
Hold memory close at hand
Help me understand the years
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell
How I wish I would save my soul
I'm so cold from fear

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
Far, far away; find comfort in pain
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain

The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/thesoundofsilence.html,"Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence.""",1964,sad
Breathe (2 AM),Anna Nalick,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annanalick/breathe2am.html,"2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake,
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him. Winter just wasn't my season.""

Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize.
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl.
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe... just breathe,
Oh breathe, just breathe

May he turn 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist,
Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year.

Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while,
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles,
Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.
No one can find the rewind button, boys,
So cradle your head in your hands,
And breathe... just breathe,
Oh breathe, just breathe

There's a light at each end of this tunnel,
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
If you'd only try turning around.

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me,
Threatening the life it belongs to

And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand.
And breathe, just breathe
Whoa breathe, just breathe,
Oh breathe, just breathe,
Oh breathe, just breathe.",2005,sad
Harrowdown Hill,Thom Yorke,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thomyorke/harrowdownhill.html,"Don't walk the plank like I did
You will be dispensed with
When you've become inconvenient

That's where I'm lying down

Did I fall or was I pushed?
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Then where's the blood?
Then where's the blood?

But I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes

We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it

Ask the ministry
Don't ask me
Ask the ministry

We think the same things at the same time
There are so many of us
So you can't count

We think the same things at the same time
There are too many of us
So you can't count

Can you see me when I'm running?
Can you see me when I'm running?
Away from them, away from them

I can't take their pressure
No one cares if you live or die
They just want me gone
They want me gone

But I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes

We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time

So you can't 
There are too many of us
So you can't count

Your dry blood on my fingertip

Skellig,Loreena McKennitt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loreenamckennitt/skellig.html,"O light the candle, John
The daylight has almost gone
The birds have sung their last
The bells call all to mass

Sit here by my side
For the night is very long
There's something I must tell
Before I pass along

I joined the brotherhood
My books were all to me
I scribed the words of God
And much of history

Many a year was I
Perched out upon the sea
The waves would wash my tears,
The wind, my memory

I'd hear the ocean breathe
Exhale upon the shore
I knew the tempest's blood
Its wrath I would endure

And so the years went by
Within my rocky cell
With only a mouse or bird
My friend; I loved them well

And so it came to pass
I'd come here to Romani
And many a year it took
Till I arrived here with thee

On dusty roads I walked
And over mountains high
Through rivers running deep
Beneath the endless sky

Beneath these jasmine flowers
Amidst these cypress trees
I give you now my books
And all their mysteries

Now take the hourglass
And turn it on its head
For when the sands are still
'Tis then you'll find me dead

O light the candle, John
The daylight is almost gone
The birds have sung their last
The bells call all to mass",1997,sad
White Flag,Dido,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/whiteflag.html,"I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again

And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door

Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely

And it hurts my soul cause I can't let go, all these walls are cavin' in

I hate to show that I've lost control 'cause I
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away...

I should have known that I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke, it was all an illusion
Now I've been lickin' my wounds, but the venom seeps deeper
We both can seduce, but darlin' you hold me prisoner

Oh I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
I'm about to break and I can't stop this ache, getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve the pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away...

Every time I try to grasp for air, I am smothered in despair it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare, I let out a silent pray
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more

Now what to do, my heart has been bruised, so sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul 'cause I can't let go, all these walls are cavin' in

I'm addicted to your allure and I'm fiending for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin right back to the one thing that I need, Oh
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return what did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn I keep goin right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

Butterfly,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/butterfly.html,"Yesterday I went outside
With my momma's mason jar
Caught a lovely Butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast

I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Everytime I pin down what I think I want
It slips away - the ghost slips away
I smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasies
A life of chasing butterfly 

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Everytime I pin down what I think I want

In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

I guess I should go now
She's waiting to make up
To tell me she's sorry
And how much she missed me
I guess I'm just burnt out
I really should slow down
I'm perfectly fine but
I just need to lie down

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together...",2002,sad

I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms",2002,sad
Littlest Things,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/littlestthings.html,"Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissin'
And I remember when you started callin' me your missus
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, Tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, Tell me
Is this the end?",2006,sad
Fade to Black,Metallica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/metallica/fadetoblack.html,"Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye",1984,sad
Day Old Hate,City and Colour,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cityandcolour/dayoldhate.html,"So let's face it this was never what you wanted
But I know it's fun to pretend
Now blank stares and empty threats
Are all I have, they're all I have.

So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I'll find you before I drift away

Now you still speak of day old hate
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
And how safe it is to feel safe.

So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I'll find you before I drift away

The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to stay alive
The things we do just to keep ourselves alive.",2005,sad
Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/slowdancinginaburningroom.html,"It's not a silly little moment,
It's not the storm before the calm.
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on.

Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms.
Nobody's gonna come and save you,
We pulled too many false alarms.

We're going down,
And you can see it too.
We're going down,
And you know that we're doomed.
My dear,
We're slow dancing in a burning room.

I was the one you always dreamed of,
You were the one I tried to draw.
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw.

I'll make the most of all the sadness,
You'll be a bitch because you can.
You try to hit me just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand.

We're going down,
And you can see it too.
We're going down,
And you know that we're doomed.
My dear,
We're slow dancing in a burning room.

Go cry about it - why don't you?
Go cry about it - why don't you?
Go cry about it - why don't you?

My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room,
Burning room,
Burning room,
Burning room,
Burning room.

Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow?
Don't you think we oughta know by now?

Love Hurts,Incubus,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/incubus/lovehurts.html,"Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
(I don't want to lose what I had as a boy.)
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat.
(As common as a cold day in LA.)
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts...
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive.
Love sings,
When it transcends the bad things.
Have a heart and try me,
'cause without love I won't survive.

I'm fettered and abused,
I stand naked and accused
(Should I surface this one man submarine?)
I only want the truth
So tonight we drink to youth!
(I'll never lose what I had as a boy.)
Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Breathe,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/breathe.html,"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie.
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

The Heart Wants What It Wants,Selena Gomez,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/selenagomez/theheartwantswhatitwants.html,"You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

For its such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

The blackness of darkness forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness of darkness forever

Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks, that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

The blackness of darkness forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness of darkness forever

Last Goodbye,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/lastgoodbye.html,"This is our last goodbye 
I hate to feel the love between us die 
But it's over 
Just hear this and then i'll go 
You gave me more to live for 
More than you'll ever know 

This is our last embrace 
Must I dream and always see your face 
Why can't we overcome this wall 
Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all 

Kiss me, please kiss me 
But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation 
You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time 
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye 

Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,' 
And did you rush to the phone to call 
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind 
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all 
You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know 

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime 
Burning clues into this heart of mine 
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories 
Offer signs that it's over... it's over",1994,sad
At Seventeen,Janis Ian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisian/atseventeen.html,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen",1975,sad

Travelin' Soldier,Dixie Chicks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dixiechicks/travelinsoldier.html,"Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth in a cafÃ© there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talking to me?
I'm feeling a little low.""
She said, ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go.""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said, ""I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care.
I got no one to send a letter to.
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart
It might be love and all of the things he was so scared of
He said, ""When it's getting kinda rough over here,
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier.
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile.
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for awhile.""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the Anthem sang
A man said, ""Folks would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead.""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read but nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter said
A soldier's coming 

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier

In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best?

Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

I taste your mouth
He pulled me in

Anything is better than to be alone.

'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight
I want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...

I remember it well
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing

I remember it well
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth...

I want you here tonight
I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight
I want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...

Except you my love. Except you my love...

Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
I hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper machÃ©

Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God will forgive me
But I, I whip myself with scorn, scorn

I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
I remember december
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
What the hell do you want?",2003,sad
Chemo Limo,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/chemolimo.html,"I had a dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said if you don't want to do it
then you don't have to do it
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then in my dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway
And I smiled cause I'd known it all the while.

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I ain't about to pay for this shit
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I ain't about to to die like this
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
And besides this shit is making me tired
it's making me tired
it's making me tired
You know I plan to retire some day,
And I'm gonna go out in style
go out in style
This shit it's making me tired
it's making me tired
it's making me tired
But mama's gonna go out in style, go out in style

When I woke up
My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company

Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in

The doctor he asked which way we were headed
I said, Sir, let's just go west and he listened obediently,
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
with her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I ain't about to pay for this shit
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo

Ohne dich,Rammstein,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rammstein/ohnedich.html,"Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Dahin wo ich sie zuletzt gesehen
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
Und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Weh mir, oh weh
Und die VÃ¶gel singen nicht mehr

Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein
Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein
Ohne dich
Ohne dich zÃ¤hl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
Lohnen nicht

Auf den Ãsten in den GrÃ¤ben
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
Und das Atmen fÃ¤llt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh

Remembering Sunday,All Time Low,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alltimelow/rememberingsunday.html,"He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days

Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother,
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm going to ask her to marry me

Even though she doesn't believe in love,
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut

Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother,
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm going to ask her to marry me

The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

[Juliet Simms:]
I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world,
From so many thousands of feet off the ground, I'm over you now
I'm at home in the clouds, and towering over your head

[Alex Gaskarth:]
Well I guess I'll go home now...
I guess I'll go home now...
I guess I'll go home now...

Storm,Lifehouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lifehouse/storm.html,"How long have I been in this storm?
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Water's getting harder to tread
With these waves crashing over my head

If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness would turn to light

And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be alright
I know everything is alright

I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Because I'm so used to living underneath the surface

If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness would turn to light

And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
And I know everything will be alright

I'm Still Breathing,Katy Perry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/imstillbreathing.html,"I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending
All the signs that
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving
My two weeks

Pick your favorite
Shade of black
You'd best
Prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say
That you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear
You didn't care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say
That you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost

I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost a grip

The Unforgiven,Metallica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/metallica/theunforgiven.html,"New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.

With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all â
This bitter man he is.

Throughout his life the same â
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win â
A tired man they see no longer cares.

The old man then prepares
To die regretfully â
That old man here is me.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

And the stars look very different today

I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much

Introduced by a friend of a friend
Smiled and said ""yes I think we've met before""

Captured a taxi despite all the rain
We drove in silence across Pont Champlain
And all of the time you thought I was sad
I was trying to remember your name...

This scar is a fleck on my porcelain skin
Tried to reach deep but you couldn't get in
Now you're outside me
You see all the beauty
Repent all your sin

It's nothing but time and a face that you lose
I chose to feel it and you couldn't choose
I'll write you a postcard
I'll send you the news
From the house down the road from real love...

Live through this, and you won't look back...
Live through this, and you won't look back...
Live through this, and you won't look back...

There's one thing I want to say, so I'll be brave

Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Stairway to Heaven,Led Zeppelin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ledzeppelin/stairwaytoheaven.html,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",1971,sad

From the second of May
Reminds me of the summer time
On this winter's day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home

You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine

Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I'd whine out

Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Will end

You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really OK
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and
Take care honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye"")

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you. Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me, just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away!""
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

Silent All These Years,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/silentalltheseyears.html,"Excuse me but can I be you for a while
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
Yeah I can hear that

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know
But nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me
You never shut up
Yeah I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been here
Silent all these years

So you found a girl
Who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
Boy you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you

My scream got lost in a paper cup
Do you think there's a heaven
Where the screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker
Do you think it's enough
To get us there

'Cause what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been here
Silent all these...

Years go by
Will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand
Years go by
If I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds
Raining in my head

Years go by
Will I choke on my tears
'Til finally there is nothing left
One more casualty
You know we're too easy easy easy

Well I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now
But baby don't look up
The sky is falling

Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin' at you
Here take hold of my hand
Yeah I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
I hear my voice
I hear my voice

And it's been here
Silent all these years
I've been here
Silent all these years",1992,sad
Gone Away,My Brightest Diamond,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mybrightestdiamond/goneaway.html,"Far away you've gone, and left me here
So cold without you, so lonely dear
May June July I count the time
Every minute I go takes the smell of your clothes further away

'Cause you've gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

I have saved every piece of paper
Like grocery lists and note cards
To-do lists and race scores
So just in case you change your mind and come back
I've kept everything safe

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

Get me out get me off
Get me out get me off
This is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
That you've left behind

For this is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
To keep me company in my old age

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
Why don't you write to say goodbye?
Goodbye",2006,sad
Guess I'm Doing Fine,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/guessimdoingfine.html,"There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me

I just wade the tides that turned
Till I learn to leave the past behind

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow

Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time

It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine",2002,sad
Look What You've Done,Jet,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jet/lookwhatyouvedone.html,"Take my photo off the wall

Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won

Give me back my point of view
'Cause I just can't think for you
I can hardly hear you say
What should I do, well you choose

Why,Annie Lennox,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annielennox/why.html,"How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Heyâ¦ this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell meâ¦
Why?
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besidesâ¦
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Tell me
Why?

Tell me
Why?

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tearsâ¦
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
You don't know what I feel",1992,sad
Cup of Coffee,Garbage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garbage/cupofcoffee.html,"You told me you don't love me 
Over a cup of coffee 
And I just have to look away 
A million miles between us 
Planets crash into dust 
I just let it fade away 

I'm walking empty streets 
Hoping we might meet 
I see your car parked on the road 
The light on at your window 
I know for sure that you're home 
But I just have to pass on by 

So no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I'm still this obsessed 
I guess I always knew the score 
This is how our story ends 

I smoke your brand of cigarettes 
And pray that you might give me a call 
I lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls 
Hanging round bars at night 
Wishing I had never been born 
And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home 

So no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I still feel like this 
I guess I always knew the score 
This is where our story ends 

You left behind some clothes 
My belly summersaults when I pick them off the floor 
My friends all say they're worried 
I'm looking far too skinny 
I've stopped returning all their calls 

And no, of course, we can't be friends 
Not while I'm still so obsessed 
I want to ask where I went wrong 
But don't say anything at all 

It took a cup of coffee 
To prove that you don't love me",2001,sad
Society,Eddie Vedder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eddievedder/society.html,"It's a mystery to me
We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all, you won't be free

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have, you think you need
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keepin score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
And you can't do that

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me 
Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
Society, you're crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me",ound,sad
Where the Wild Roses Grow,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/wherethewildrosesgrow.html,"They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day 
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild 
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face 
[Chorus]
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, ""Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"" 
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said: ""Will you give me your loss and your sorrow""
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, ""If I show you the roses, will you follow?"" 
[Chorus]
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt (stood smiling) above me with a rock in his fist 
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, ""All beauty must die""
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth 
[Chorus]",1996,sad
Ultraviolence,Lana Del Rey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lanadelrey/ultraviolence.html,"He used to call me DN
That stood for deadly nightshade
Cause I was filled with poison

Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kids

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enough

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins

We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on earth
I will do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this, this union
Crying tears of gold, like lemonade

I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever,
I love you forever

Ultraviolence

You'll Think of Me,Keith Urban,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/keithurban/youllthinkofme.html,"I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Damaged,Plumb,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/plumb/damaged.html,"Dreaming comes so easily
'cause it's all that i've known
True love is a fairy tale

I'm scared and i'm alone
I'm ashamed
And i need for you to know

I didn't say all the things that i wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'cause i feel you, i feel you near me

I didn't say all the things that i wanted to say

And you can't take back what you've taken away
'cause i feel you, i feel you near me

Healing comes so painfully
And it chills to the bone
Will anyone get close to me?

Forgiveness for a man who was stronger
I was just a little girl, but i can't go back",1999,sad

Is it possible Mr. Loveable
Is already in my life?
Right in front of me
Or maybe you're in disguise

Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

Here we are again, circles never end
How do I find the perfect fit
There's enough for everyone
But I'm still waiting in line

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

If there's a soulmate for everyone

Most relationships seem so transitory
They're all good but not the permanent one

Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone

Who doesn't long for someone to hold

Working too hard 
Driving myself to death 
Trying to beat out the faults in my head

Sure we all make mistakes 
But they see me so large 
That they think I'm immune to the pain

What am I leaving
When I'm done here?

Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are

I don't need a better thing.
I'd settle for less.
It's another thing for me.
I just have to wander through this world alone.

Stop before you fall
Into the hole that I have dug here.
Rest even as you
Are starting to feel the way I used to.
I don't need a better thing
Just to sound confused.
Don't talk about everyone.
I am not amused by you.

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/theboxer.html,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie-la-lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie-la-lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
OR cut him 'til he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie-la-lie...",1970,sad

I'm a rabbit in your headlights

Washed down the toilet
Money to burn
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away

Caught between stations
Butter fingers

You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad

That I ever had

Maybe I was naÃ¯ve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well

And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever, forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this

I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep

Fragile,Sting,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/fragile.html,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are
How fragile we are how fragile we are",1987,sad
Full of Grace,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/fullofgrace.html,"the winter here's cold, and bitter
it's chilled us to the bone
we haven't seen the sun for weeks
too long too far from home
I feel just like I'm sinking
and I claw for solid ground
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
oh darkness I feel like letting go

if all of the strength and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place
I know I can love you much better than this
full of grace
full of grace
my love

so it's better this way, I said
having seen this place before
where everything we say and do
hurts us all the more
its just that we stayed, too long
in the same old sickly skin
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
oh darkness I feel like letting go

if all of the strength
and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place
I know I could love you much better than this
full of grace
full of grace
my love",1997,sad
Another Day in Paradise,Phil Collins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/philcollins/anotherdayinparadise.html,"She calls out to the man on the street
""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice, cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it

Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cos she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice, cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise        

Just think about it
Just think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise

A happy song
But my happiness disappeared

This day would come
Now all I'm feeling
Is lost and numb

And ohhh I know I promised
Mmmm that I would try

But I, yes I, miss you
And it's killing inside

I'll always be thankful
For the time we had
We were blessed
I should celebrate
But I feel too sad
All the wonderful memories
Just make me fall apart
And it feels like somebody's
Stabbed me in my heart

And ohhh I know I promised
Mmmm that I wouldn't cry

But I, yes I, miss you
And it's killing inside
Ooh well I, yes I, miss you
Want you by my side

Walking, holding hands
Talking, making plans
Touching my heart my soul

I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared 
The moment you were gone
Tell me it's not happening
Say it's not as it seems
Tell me that I'm gonna wake up
It's just a bad dream
Please tell me that it's fiction
Tell me it's just a lie
Whatever you choose to tell me
Please say he didn't die

And it's killing inside
Ooh well I, yes I, miss you
Want you by my side
Ooh well I, miss you
Want you by my side

Let Down,Radiohead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiohead/letdown.html,"Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and ...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day....
I am going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...

The Only Exception,Paramore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paramore/theonlyexception.html,"When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind.
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it.

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget.
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist.

But darling,
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts.
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone.
Or keep a straight face.

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance.
And up until now I have sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness.

Because none of it was ever worth the risk.

Well you are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.

I've got a tight grip on reality,
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here.
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up.
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh.

You are the only exception. [4x]

You are the only exception. [4x]

I'm going down, going down the drain

Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down

And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things
Those little things
The little things they bring

Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you

I'm just falling to pieces

And if this is giving up then I'm giving up
If this is giving up then I'm giving up, giving up
On love, On love

And maybe I'm not up for being a victim of love
When all my resistance will never be distance enough

Driving away from the wreck of the day
And it's finally quiet in my head
Driving alone, finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed
And if this is giving up, then I'm giving up
If this is giving up, then I'm giving up, giving up

How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending.

I am alone
In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home

But We Could Always Sing.

What About The Night We Cried,
Because There Wasn't Any Reason Left To Keep It All Inside.
Never Understood A Word.
But You Were Always There With A Smile.

And If I Say I Really Loved You
And Was Glad You Came Along.

If You Were Here Today.
Ooh- Ooh- Ooh- For You Were In My Song.
Ooh- Ooh- Ooh- Here To - Day.",1982,sad
Sad Lisa,Cat Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catstevens/sadlisa.html,"She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
She must be hurt very badly
Tell me what's making you sadly?
Open your door, don't hide in the dark
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me
'Cause you know that's how it must be

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
Upon her pain getting deeper
Though my love wants to relieve her
She walks alone from wall to wall
Lost in a hall, she can't hear me
Though I know she likes to be near me

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

She sits in a corner by the door
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her
I'll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her

Candle in the Wind,Elton John,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/candleinthewind.html,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did",1973,sad
Now at Last,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/nowatlast.html,"Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For have lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winter lonely
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winter lonely
Now at last I know",2004,sad
Into Dust,Mazzy Star,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mazzystar/intodust.html,"Still falling
Breathless and on again
Inside today
Beside me today
Around, broken in two
Till your eyes shed
Into dust
Like two strangers
Turning into dust
Till my hand shook
With the weight of fear

I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate

It was you
Breathless and torn
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers
Turning into dust
Turning into dust",1993,sad
Life on Mars?,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/lifeonmars.html,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Dring-dring-dring.

Bleeding Love,Leona Lewis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonalewis/bleedinglove.html,"Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I

My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight

For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known

Can keep it like a haunting
Heart beating close to mine

'Cause I can tell... you know what it's like.
A long farewell... of the hunger strike.
But can you save me?
Come on and save me...
If you could save me,

Like Peter Pan, or Superman,
You have come... to save me.
Come on and save me...

Who suspect they could never love anyone,
Except the freaks,
Who suspect they could never love anyone,

The Winner Takes It All,ABBA,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/abba/thewinnertakesitall.html,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
It seems plain to me",1980,sad
It Must Have Been Love,Roxette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/itmusthavebeenlove.html,"(It must have been love but it's over now)

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now

Already Gone,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/alreadygone.html,"Remember all the things we wanted

It never would have worked out right
We were never meant for ""do or die""

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go

And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry

Started with the perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go

And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better

When you know that it's wrong

I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone

Better in Time,Leona Lewis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonalewis/betterintime.html,"It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know

If you didn't notice
You mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it

If you didn't notice
Boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
(no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be
(but I know, but know)
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
Yes, I do
It'll all get better in time

Forgot how to cry

Why believing is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing

Not Dark Yet,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/notdarkyet.html,"Shadows are fallin' and I've been here all day

I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.

Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin' what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.

Well, I've been to London and I been to gay Paris
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of the world full of lies
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.

I was born here and I'll die here against my will
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.",1997,sad

Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade away

And after all it won't take long to fall in love
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start",2004,sad

We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.

Too many books
Read me your favourite line

Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day, you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time

Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times

She broke down the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time
On my mind
Pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time",2003,sad
Sombra de Ti,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/sombradeti.html,"Voy a dejar
Que mi guitarra diga todo lo que yo
No sÃ© decir por mÃ­

O quizÃ¡ deba esperar
A que el insulto del reloj
Acabe de planear mi fin

Duelen tanto las sonrisas
Cuesta un mundo respirar
Es que no tenerte aquÃ­ ya me hace mal

Me sigue rodeando la sombra de ti
Y siguen rodando por ahÃ­
Todas las palabras que dijimos
Y los besos que nos dimos
Como siempre hoy estoy
Pensando en ti

Debes saber
Que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
Regados por aquÃ­

Y que tropiezo cada dÃ­a sin pensar
Con un viejo recuerdo mÃ¡s
Y alguna nueva historia gris

Si no puedo estar contigo
Ya no puedo estar sin ti
Cada vez se hace mÃ¡s duro ser feliz

Me sigue rodeando la sombra de ti
Y siguen rodando por ahÃ­
Todas las palabras que dijimos
Y los besos que nos dimos
Como siempre hoy estoy
Pensando en ti",1998,sad
Soldier Side,System of a Down,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/systemofadown/soldierside.html,"Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when Savior comes, is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth
He's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the King his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find no truth
He's never going home

Welcome to the Soldier Side
Where there is no one here but me
People all grow up to die
There is no one here but me

Welcome to the Soldier Side
There is no one here but me
People on the soldier's side
There is no one here but me",2005,sad
Hero of War,Rise Against,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/riseagainst/heroofwar.html,"He said ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun and you'll even get paid""
I said ""That sounds pretty good""

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looks alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well what would you say, if I said that you could?""",2008,sad
Secret Love Song,Little Mix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/littlemix/secretlovesong.html,"When you hold me in the street
And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this
We got a love that is homeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

[Jason Derulo:]
When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl, you know this
We got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we're making
I'm living for that day
Someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that?

Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftop

The Trapeze Swinger,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/thetrapezeswinger.html,"Please remember me, happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah",2009,sad

Turn down the bed.
Turn down these voices
Inside my head.

Lay down with me;
Tell me no lies.
Just hold me close;
Don't patronize.

Don't patronize me.

'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't.
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't.
Here in the dark
In these final hours,
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power;
But you won't.
No, you won't.
'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't.

I'll close my eyes,
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me.

Morning will come,
And I'll do what's right;
Just give me till then
To give up this fight.

And I will give up this fight.

The Pieces Don't Fit Anymore,James Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmorrison/thepiecesdontfitanymore.html,"I've been twisting and turning in a space that's too small
I've been drawing a line and watching it fall

Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart

'Cause I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now
Oh, just leave me now

It's time to surrender

When the pieces don't fit anymore

The pieces don't fit here anymore

Well, you pulled me under so I had to give in
Such a beautiful mess that's breaking my skin
Well, I'll hide all the bruises; I'll hide all the damage that's done
But I show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone

Well, I can't explain why it's not enough
'Cause I gave it all to you

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

For your next parade
You came to make sure
That I'm not running

In all kinds of ways
Guess it was his turn this time

Thought I'd made friends with time
Thought we'd be flying
Maybe not this time

Do What You Have to Do,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/dowhatyouhavetodo.html,"What ravages of spirit

and fate has led you through it
you do what you have to do ...

and I have the sense to recognize that
I don't know how to let you go

with apparitions of your soul
I'm ever swiftly moving
trying to escape this desire
the yearning to be near you
I do what I have to do
the yearning to be near you
I do what I have to do
but I have the sense to recognize

that I don't know how
to let you go
I don't know how
to let you go

burning hot
burning slow
deep within I'm shaken by the violence
of existing for only you

They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
'Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion, and sex, and T.V.
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me",1970,sad

Please forgive me
I know not what I do.
Please forgive me

Don't deny me
This pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me if I need you like I do
Oh, believe me.
Every word I say is true.
Please forgive me
I can't stop loving you.

One thing I'm sure of is the way we make love.
And one thing I depend on is for us to stay strong.
With every word and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'...

Please forgive me
I know not what I do.
Please forgive me
I can't stop lovin' you.
Don't deny me.
This pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me if I need you like I do.
Babe, believe me.

Please forgive me if I can't stop loving you.
Never leave me
I don't know what I'd do.
Please forgive me

Can't stop loving you.",,sad
Knives Out,Radiohead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiohead/knivesout.html,"I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would've drowned you at birth

Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot",2001,sad
Where'd You Go,Fort Minor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fortminor/wheredyougo.html,"Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.

She said, ""Some days I feel like shit.
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone.
I get along but the trips always feel so long.

And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone,
But I feel like an idiot workin' my day around a call,
But when I pick up I don't have much to say.

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career.
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

Come back home. You know the place where you used to live,
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,
But now you only stop by every once in a while.

Shit. I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind.
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way.
You can call me if you find that you have something to say.

And I'll tell you: I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career.
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin', and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless.

It seems one thing has been true all along:
You don't really know what you've got 'til it's gone.
I guess I've had it with you and your career.
When you come back I won't be here,
And you can sing it.

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.

Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.

Nightswimming,R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/nightswimming.html,"Nightswimming deserves a quiet night

The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago,
turned around backwards so the windshield shows.
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still it's so much clearer

I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day

Nightswimming, 
remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
The bright tide forever drawn 
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night",1992,sad

My life is brilliant
My love is pure

She was with another man

You're beautiful. You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true

As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high

But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful. You're beautiful

Wish You Were Here,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/wishyouwerehere.html,"So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.",1975,sad

With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known

If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

Love Will Tear Us Apart,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/lovewilltearusapart.html,"When routine bites hard,
And ambitions are low,
And resentment rides high,
But emotions won't grow,
And we're changing our ways,
Taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry.
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

You cry out in your sleep,
All my failings exposed.
And there's a taste in my mouth,
As desperation takes hold.
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.",ompi,sad

Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore

You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away

I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart

Come on tell me

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be

Come on tell me

All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love",1995,sad

Around our heads

To remind me
To find my own

Just know that these things will never change for us at all

The angel from my nightmare,
The shadow in the background of the morgue.
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley.

If we want.

Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas.
And in the night we'll wish this never ends,
We'll wish this never ends.

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry.
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight.
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time.

And as I stared I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides.

Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason.
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight.

Don't waste your time on me.
You're already the voice inside my head.

Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

That I left unspoken

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

Hide And Seek,Imogen Heap,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/imogenheap/hideandseek.html,"Where are we? What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall,
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling.
Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes.
This can't be happening.
When busy streets amass with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy.

Hide and seek.
Trains and sewing machines.
All those years they were here first.

Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before.
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.

Hide and seek.
Trains and sewing machines. (Oh, you won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears (hearts),
They were here first.

Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that you only meant well? Well, of course you did.
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's all for the best? Of course it is.
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's just what we need? And you decided this.
What you say?
Mmm, what did She say?

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth.
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs.
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you.
You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.

Samson,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/samson.html,"You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed
And history books forgot about us and the bible didn't mention us
And the bible didn't mention us, not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met

Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
Told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
Oh I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me 'til the mornin' light, the mornin' light
And he kissed me 'til the mornin' light

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
Ate a slice of wonderbread and went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the bible didn't mention us, not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first",2002,sad

Sought by single m: Mrs.Destiny, send photo to address, is it you and me?

My name is Caroline. Cell phone number here, call if you have the time
28 and bored, grieving over loss, sorry to be heavy but heavy is the cost, heavy is the cost

Reply to Caroline:
Thanks so much for response, these things can be scary
Not always what you want
How about a drink? The St. Jude club at noon?
I'll phone you first, I guess
I hope I see you soon!

I never got your name, I assume you're 33
Your voice it sounded kind
I hope that you like me
When you see my face, I hope that you don't laugh
I'm not a film-star beauty
I'll send a photograph
I hope that you don't laugh...

Note to single m:
Why did you not show up?
I waited for an hour, I finally gave up
I thought once that I saw you, I thought that you saw me
I guess we'll never meet now

I was sure you saw me, but it wasn't meant to be

A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Kept his dick wet

And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Lua,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/lua.html,"I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone.

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.

And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist.

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.

I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.

And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
It was so simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight",ingl,sad
Black,Pearl Jam,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/black.html,"Hey... oooh...

Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I'm spinning, oh
I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be... yeah...

Uh huh... uh huh... ooh...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?

Red blue green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape

Sing in Silence,Sonata Arctica,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sonataarctica/singinsilence.html,"You were daddy's girl nice and sweet
Never in trouble mommy's honey
Little child who just couldn't see
The pressure from her so called friends
Was simply too much

The monkey slowly climbed on her back
Offering an aid for her pain
Giving love and care
No-one cared, no-one cared...

Fragile like a rose on the snow
Eating all your strength and your money
Walking in the shade day and night
Never letting sunshine in your eyes like before

Cannot shake the monkey off your back
Did I see a spark on your eye
Was it just the last light of hope
That died, hope that died

""Forgive me, Father, my daily sin...""

How can I forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
Haven of Emotion, Mournful Ocean
Heiress of the Evening Sings in silence

""I need to have now, my daily sin...""

For all your life I prayed for time
To show you where the light lies
Now this is the end
One rose for the memory of the innosence...

""I know, my Father, I cannot win...""

Never will forgive you, never leave you
You know that if you live like, you will die like
How can I erase your pain and aid you
When Death wants to kiss you and you want kiss Him back...",2001,sad
The Needle Has Landed,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/theneedlehaslanded.html,"Here I am in traffic's slow flow
Where the needle touched down
Carbon planes draw a cage round the air force base
Where the needle touched down
My foot on the brake it's ok to fly low
Over poor Spanaway

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter
The needle's the same that recorded and played
When you left me at the greyhound the year I moved away
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here baby
My baby, baby

So that's why I never come back here
That's why they spit out my name
Your ex's have clawed up the bible
Trying to keep me away
With the sledge of tectonic fever
The needle has landed again
Let it play

And the needle touched down
The needle is landing
And the needle touched down
The needle is landing

An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town
From a sharp-toothed freighter
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here",2006,sad
The Jeep Song,The Dresden Dolls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dresdendolls/thejeepsong.html,"I've been driving around town 
With my head spinning around
Everywhere i look i see
Your '96 jeep cherokee

You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that ive been through
You'd think i'd hate the sight of you

But with every jeep i see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess its just my stupid luck
That all of boston drives that same black fucking truck

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style...

I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When i wonder if it makes you want to cry 
Every time you see a light blue volvo driving by

So dont tell me that you're off to see the world
I know you wont get very far
Dont call me if you get another girl baby
Just call me if you get another car

The number of them is insane
Every exit's an exboyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and i want to paint it black

It could be him or am i tripping
And i'm crashing into everything
I can't wait til you trade that fucker in
By then they will have stuck me in the looney bin

It could be him my heart is pounding
Its just no use i'm surrounded
But someday i'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that cherokee straight off this trail of tears",2004,sad

and I am full

I guess everything's been said
so I am coming home with an empty head

you'll say did they love you or what
I'll say they love what I do
the only one who really loves me is you

but my fingers are sore
and my voice is too

you'll say it's really good to see you
you'll say I missed you horribly
you'll say let me carry that
give that to me
and you will take the heavy stuff
and you will drive the car
and I'll look out the window making jokes
about the way things are

if we were our futures
if we were our defenses i'd be joining you
if we were our culture
if we were our leaders
if we were our denials i'd be joining you

you said ""I don't want ever to be brainwashed"" and you were mindboggling you were intense
you were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful
if we were our nametags
if we were our rejections
if we were our outcomes i'd be joining you
if we were our indignities
if we were our successes
if we were our emotions i'd be joining you
you and I we're like 4 year olds we want to know why and how come about everything
we want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds and never talk small and be intuitive
and question mightily and find god my tortured beacon
we need to find like-minded companions
if we were their condemnations
if we were their projections
if we were our paranoias i'd be joining you
if we were our incomes
if we were our obsession
if we were our afflictions i'd be joining you

See the same sad faces

That God's got everybody in His hands

Is He listening?

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young and being so vain

Holes in your head today

I've walked La Ramblas
But not with real intent

And if you tolerate this

With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

I may just never see you again, or might as well

New York Minute,Don Henley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donhenley/newyorkminute.html,"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here;
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
You can get out of the rain
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute",1989,sad

you don't know anything bout' me

an ocean a lake I need a place to drown

tomorrow you'll be gone, gone, gone

I feel peculiar now what do you feel
do you think there's a chance that we can fall

you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
what do I know I know your name
you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me anymore

I've noticed these are mysterious days
I look at it like a jigsaw puzzle and gaze
with wide open mouth and burning eyes

In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said there'd be no one else
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I've burned out cupid's arrow
And here's the short and the narrow
I've nothing left to offer you

For a handful of nothing

When you're pushing and a-shoving me around

There was no disguise
You knew where I stood from the start
So stop
Look around you

Take back your cold and empty heart

You Have Been Loved,George Michael,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgemichael/youhavebeenloved.html,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world
We've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If i was weak, forgive me
But i was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And i'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove

And heaven help the ones who wait for you

Well i've no daughters, i've no sons
Guess i'm the only one
Living in my life

Take care my love, he said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, he said

You have been loved",1996,sad
Stop,Sam Brown,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sambrown/stop.html,"All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you ever worry that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Stop if love me
(you will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(that day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop",1988,sad

There Goes The Fear,Doves,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/doves/theregoesthefear.html,"Out of here
We're out of here
Along with fear
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

And cars speed fast
Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love
to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify
You turned around and life's
passed you by
Passed you by, again

And late last night
Makes up her mind
Another fight
Left behind
There goes the fear again, let it go
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's
passed you by
You look to ones you love
to ask them why?
You look to those you love
to justify, why?
You turned around and life's
passed you by

Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when he's calling out
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today

There goes the fear again, let it go
There goes the fear, let it go

Think of me when you close your eyes

Take It Easy (Love Nothing),Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/takeiteasylovenothing.html,"First with your hands and then with your mouth
A downpour of sweat, damp cotton clouds
I was a fool, you were my friend
We made it happen
You took off your clothes, left on the light
You stood there so brave
You used to be shy
Each feature improved, each movement refined and eyes like a showroom
Now they are spreading out the blankets on the beach
That weatherman is a liar
He said it would be raining but it's clear and blue as far as I can see

Left by the lamp, right next to the bed, 
On a cartoon cat pad she scratched with a pen,
""Everything is as it's always been. 
This never happened.
Don't take it too bad it is nothing you did.
It's just once something dies you can't make it live.
You're a beautiful boy.
You're a sweet little kid but I am a woman.""
So I laid back down and wrapped myself up in the sheet
And I must have looked like a ghost 'cause something frightened me
And since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
And a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I'll try and be kind when I ask you to leave
We'll both take it easy
But if you stay too long inside my memory,
I will trap you in a song tied to a melody
And I will keep you there so you can't bother me",2005,sad

Inside of Love,Nada Surf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nadasurf/insideoflove.html,"Watching terrible TV
It kills all thought
Getting spacier than
An astronaut
Making out with people
I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do
Late at night

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above

Only when we get to see
The aerial view
Will the patterns show
We'll know what to do
I know the last page so well
I can't read the first
So I just don't start
It's getting worse

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I can't find my way in
I try again and again

[Bridge:]
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
Must be a different view
To be a me with a you

I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love

Lately,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/lately.html,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I'm a man of many wishes

Found Out About You,Gin Blossoms,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ginblossoms/foundoutaboutyou.html,"All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you

How can I fight beside you

Just waiting

I spoke to a man down at the tracks
And I asked him how he don't go mad
He said ""Look here junior, don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad""

There I stand 'neath the marquee moon

Well a Cadillac, it pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me, all they said ""get in"" (""get in"")
Then the Cadillac, it puttered back into the graveyard
Me, I got out again

To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
Then she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun

But now she might leave
Like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her

But now you're scared
You think she's running away
You search in your head for something clever to say
Don't go away
'Cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out
Put it in the safe and lock it

He realizes that he's through
Whispers, ""Darling let's have fun""
Hits the exit doing 91, drives until he's in the woods
If he loses them he's gone for good

But life, could be nothing but a joke, could be nothing but a con
Where's my unhappy ending gone?

But life could be nothing but a joke, a sentimental con
Where's my unhappy ending gone? Where's my unhappy ending gone?

Why can't the ending be happy?
Why must it always resolve this way?

Our hero strokes his lover's hair
Says ""Don't worry love we're almost done""
Says ""I could have really been someone""
Outside, they surround the house with pistols drawn
It's a waiting game until dawn
Sergeant says ""He can't go on, we know now that he can't go on...""

Swing at some evil and bleed

Passing Afternoon,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/passingafternoon.html,"There are times that walk from you like some passing afternoon 
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon 
And she chose a yard to burn but the ground remembers her 
Wooden spoons, her children stir her Bougainvillea blooms 

There are things that drift away like our endless, numbered days 
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made 
And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings 
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves 

There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass 
Springtime calls her children 'till she let's them go at last 
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring 
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds 

There are things we can't recall, blind as night that finds us all 
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls 
But my hands remember hers, rolling 'round the shaded ferns 
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned 

There are names across the sea, only now I do believe 
Sometimes, with the windows closed, she'll sit and think of me 
But she'll mend his tattered clothes and they'll kiss as if they know 
A baby sleeps in all our bones, so scared to be alone",2004,sad

Because of your struggle to make them
Their taste for your past time is fading
Remember the girls in the middle are always the first to fall off

All the dregs in the crowd you barely recall

Words of love along the wires

Telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
Let's make it work tonight

Then furious you threw the picture
I cap in hand, an awful mixture
That kind of hard love is the worst
I try to speak
But you don't hear me
When you're gone
You still feel near me
For awhile
For a little while
I try telephones and old typewriters
Words of love along the wires
But nothing is working tonight
I try telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
But nothing is working tonight
Tonight
Please let's make it work tonight
Please let's make it work tonight
Tonight",2001,sad
Carousel,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/carousel.html,"Almost home
When I missed the bottom stair
You were braiding your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone

And the perfect girls
By the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know about the hive and the honey bees

Almost home
With an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on a TV stand

And the cruel wind blew
Every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes

Almost home
We got lost on our new street
While your grieving girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

And the cops couldn't care
When that crackhead built a boat
And said, ""Please, before I go
May our only honored bone
Be the kinship of the kids and the riot squad""",2007,sad
Shiver,Natalie Imbruglia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natalieimbruglia/shiver.html,"I walk a mile with a smile I donât know I donât care where I am
But I know itâs alright
Jump the tracks canât get back I donât know anyone around here
But Iâm safe this time

Cos when you, tell me, tell me, tell me stupid things, like you do
Yes I, have to, have to, have to change the rules, I canât lose

Cos I shiver, I just break up, when Iâm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up, thereâs no way that Iâll know youâll understand

We talk and talk around it all, whoâd of thought weâd end up here
But Iâm feeling fine
In a rush never trust youâll be there, if Iâd only stop
And take my time

Cos with you, Iâm running, running, running somewhere I canât get to
Yes I, have to, have to, have to change the rules, Iâm with you

Cos I shiver, I just break up when Iâm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up thereâs no way that Iâll know youâll understand

What if you get of at the next stop?
Would you just wait as Iâm drifting off?
And if I never saw you again, could I, put all, of this, aside

Cos I shiver, I just break up when Iâm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up thereâs no way that Iâll know youâll understand

I shiver, I shiver, 
Cos I shiver, I just break up when Iâm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up thereâs no way that I know youâll understand",2005,sad
Ne Me Quitte Pas,Nina Simone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ninasimone/nemequittepas.html,"Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit dÃ©jÃ 
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'aprÃ¨s ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumiÃ¨re
Je ferai un domaine
Ou l'amour sera roi
Ou l'amour sera loi
Ou tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensÃ©s
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-lÃ 
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est para'?t-il
Des terres brulÃ©es
Donnant plus de blÃ©
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'Ã©pousent-ils pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai lÃ 
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et Ã  t'Ã©couter
Chanter et puis rire

L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

She's Falling Apart,Lisa Loeb,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lisaloeb/shesfallingapart.html,"They pull up their chairs to the table
She stares at the food on her plate
At the toast and the butter
Her father and mother, she pushes away

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

She gets home from school too early
And closes the door to her room
There's nothing inside her
She's weak and she's tired of feeling like this

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

They call her for dinner, she makes up a reason
She looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves
And her mother is starting to see through her lies
And last night her father had tears in his eyes

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

And we rise in the morning
And we sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart",2002,sad
At Least I'm Not as Sad (as I Used to Be),fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/atleastimnotassadasiusedtobe.html,"Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

Câmon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, at least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, itâs been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You shouldâve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

Câmon can you count all the loves that didnât last?
Itâs such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said we wouldâve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youthâs taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing....

So I left, that is it. Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât keep friends, I keep acquainted,
Iâm not a prophet, but Iâm here to profit.

Thatâs all, Iâm gone! Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât fall in love, I just fake it.
I donât fall in love. I donât fall in love.",2009,sad

In armor coming, 
Saying something about a queen. 
There were peasants singing and 
Drummers drumming 
And the archer split the tree. 
There was a fanfare blowing 
To the sun 
That was floating on the breeze. 
Look at Mother Nature on the run 
In the nineteen seventies. 
Look at Mother Nature on the run 
In the nineteen seventies. 

I was lying in a burned out basement 
With the full moon in my eyes. 
I was hoping for replacement 
When the sun burst thru the sky. 
There was a band playing in my head 
And I felt like getting high. 
I was thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 
Thinking about what a 
Friend had said 
I was hoping it was a lie. 

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver 
Space ships flying 
In the yellow haze of the sun, 
There were children crying 
And colors flying 
All around the chosen ones. 
All in a dream, all in a dream 
The loading had begun. 
They were flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home in the sun. 
Flying Mother Nature's 
Silver seed to a new home.",2004,sad

I'm going to talk to the ferryman
He'll be expecting me

I'm crossing over now to the other side

Life is better there on the other side
The grass is greener there on the other side
And I, I get even there on the other side
And everything will turn out all right on the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
The other sideâ¦

I walked by the church house late last night
Yeah, I walked by the church house, but I didn't go inside
'Cause I, I once slept with the preacher's wife
She handed me a ticket to the other side

To the other sideâ¦",1992,sad
Killing Game,Skinny Puppy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/skinnypuppy/killinggame.html,"Fallen angel head crashes dead out of control 
Lost memories staircase twists 
Darker rooms lit with left out toys 
After playing mean changes toys into tools
Twisted playthings on the staircase fools
Fools weapons represents the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Who taught the killing game 
Awaken eyes sewn wearing glasses dripping tap tap temple door
Locked inside scream inner scraping tooth and nail nowhere to go 
Quiet retraces forcing light tears then pretend nothing blinds 
Blinds closed in sanctuary closed in sanctuary 
Padded walls not quiet storm's fury burnt out killing time 
Who taught the killing game 
Time's taught the killing game herself 
No I taught the killing game first 
Passing words distant pain remember trains of thought collide
No one view window 
Pushing faces through shards cold glass poke bloody holes exposed 
I taught the killing game first 
I taught the killing game first 
Tongue lash spewing red 
tortured animal 
wake up time 
Beckons death upon myself 
eyes travelled harden 
Strange no stronger feeling
Tempting motion slows to a crawl 
Places his weaponry in its own trap 
Let go the springs snap shut 
Crazy sharper teeth 
giving in to the jaws of death

I taught the killing game first 
I taught I taught I taught the game first",1992,sad
I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/imsolonesomeicouldcry.html,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.",1960,sad
Free Man In Paris,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/freemaninparis.html,"The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it

There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es 
Going cafÃ© to cabaret
Thinking how I'd feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery

He was sent to the reformatory
Ten years old, it was his first glory
Got caught stealing from a nun
Now his love story had begun

Thirty years he spent wandering
A devil's child with dove wings
Oh, he went to prison
In every country he set foot in
Oh, how he loved - he loved prison
How awfully lovely was prison

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

His greatest love was executed
The pure romance was undisputed
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones

Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

Like a knight from an old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons with thee

And if I have been unkind 
I hope that you will just let it go by 
And if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn 
Like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song 
By all I have done wrong 
I'll make it all up to you

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch 
He called out to me ""Don't ask for so much"" 
And a young man leaning on his darkened door 
He cried out to me ""Hey, why not ask for more""

Far More,The Honorary Title,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/honorarytitle/farmore.html,"Is this the sound of our demise
Or is it just the opposite?
I love you and I miss you
What else is there to say?
It takes a hell of a lot more to complete this

Far more, far more to recreate
Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we can take

When you decide how much time
Do you let, do you let, do you let, do you let
Pass before
These false starts, these small meals
They're for my, for my starving hands
Just treading, just treading shallow waters
Avoiding the drop, the drop in the ocean floor

Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we possess
How much, how much, how much
How much longer, girl
How much longer do we need to wait?

For a moment when the blare of the TV subsides
And that song fills the air, replaying every night
A change in the key feels like a change in the season

I pretend almost every, every other night
That this body and its entirety belongs to me, every breath
It comes and goes
It comes and goes
All night

Well, you can't dictate the way, the way I'm gonna feel
No matter what, no matter what I'm forced to see
I'll be the one free of jealousy

Well, you can't dictate the way, the way I'm gonna feel
No matter what, no matter what I'm forced to see
I'll be the one free of jealousy

Far more, far more, far more, far more
Far more, far more than we can take
So well, so well, so well rehearsed
At coordinating this kind of mess

I'll do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like we used to
Like we used to do

""If I had money, I would do things my way,""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

One thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind,

What you're really worth to me

Dinner at eight was okay
Before the toast full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again

Why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When it fact you were the one long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You left me

So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives

But 'til then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me

No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down

What you're really worth to me",2003,sad
Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/bowloforanges.html,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002,sad

And the dog drank from your cup
Frozen the river that baptized you
And the horse died standing up

But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down

Just like the way that you lost your guns
When they cut the clothesline loose
Jesus a friend of the weaker ones
Said ""I'm all they stole from you""
Freedom a thistle that withered dry
Still a baby in your hands
Frozen the ground refused to die
And the guitar rose again

When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down",2002,sad

After laughter, comes tears

[Verse One: The RZA]

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh HA
Not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's alway the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer]

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin out
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff 
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

[Chorus X2]",1993,sad
Every Word,Sade,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sade/everyword.html,"(Love is what the word was)

Barcelona,Rufus Wainwright,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rufuswainwright/barcelona.html,"The summer sun set a vicious circus
When shadows held the world in place
But today i felt a chill in my apartment's coolest place

The village larks cannot be heard
Cause all the crows got panderers
I can't escape these velvet drapes
Don't want my rings to fall off my fingers
Fuggi regal fantasima

The mirror i find hard to face
Cause i fear it's a long way down
Got to get away from here
Think i know which hemisphere
Crazy me don't think there's pain in barcelona
They dance you round a waltz confound
But i fear it's a long way down
This road
Even if that straw i pulled
And i got to fight that bull
Nothing really does compare to barcelona
Besides in spain don juan's to blame
But i fear it's a long way down
And i fear i won't be around

Got to get away from here
Think i know which hemisphere
Make sure i have all my papers
Laying out my summer clothes
Search for traps in vain like scratching
So my suitcase i can close

Coles Corner,Richard Hawley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardhawley/colescorner.html,"Hold back the night from us,
Cherish the light for us,
Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn.

Cold city lights glowing,
The traffic of life is flowing,
Out over the rivers and on into dark.

I'm going down town where there's music,
I'm going where voices fill the air,
Maybe there's someone waiting for me
With a smile and a flower in her hair

I'm going down town where there's people
The loneliness hangs in the air.
With no-one there real waiting for me,
No smile, no flower nowhere.

Cold city

Hold back

Hold back the night",2005,sad
Autumn Sweater,Yo La Tengo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yolatengo/autumnsweater.html,"When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off

We could slip away, wouldn't that be better
Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always
But it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning...",1997,sad

It's like golden corn
And i love its golden glow
It's the little head inside your little hole
And out spring some sparkling thoughts

Still love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better

It's like finding home
In an old folk song
That you've never ever heard
Still you know every word
And for sure you can sing along

But love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better
Love it would be much better

Have You Seen Her,The Chi-Lites,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chilites/haveyouseenher.html,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But to me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh why
Did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby, I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

But left that break within my heart

Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know
I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny
But I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Have you seen her
Tell me, have you seen her (tell me, have you seen her?)

These Are the Fables,The New Pornographers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newpornographers/thesearethefables.html,"In coral and gray
In submarine chambers
One day
It swam for the light
The jewels that lit
The cities that float there
Cities in circles drawn perfect, complete
Holding the secrets on my street
My street, my street

So come in and play
The song of the siren
It's commonplace
You hear the voice rise
In one wave
And crash on your doorstep
Making the circle here perfect, complete
These are the fables on my street

Ten thousand dancing girls
Kicking cans 'cross the sky
No reason why
Why ask to pay yourself
For the call of the wild
You found this child
So raise him

And wind your back
Come back to the river
The currents speed by
And hope the men fear
The hammer comes down
So hard on the evening
Cracking the dawn of your
Days are repeat
These are fables on my street
My street, my street

Heaven shook Hell
And down from its pockets
The ring in your bell
It fell through your hands
Hang at your feet
The doors that won't open
Marking the journey of our friends complete
These are the fables of my street
My street

My street, my street
Lay down in glory, you're not alone

My street, my street
Lay down in glory, you're not alone",2005,sad
The Animals of the World,Great Lake Swimmers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatlakeswimmers/theanimalsoftheworld.html,"Watching the night animals
bellying close to the ground
I was walking in the dark
It was following some feral scent
Like I was crossing the road
Like I was
Following those streets to their destinations

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end we all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the winds
Biding the tides
Riding the winds
Or biding the tides

Flying with the sun
Or perched in a row
I was at a window sill
They were unaware like I was
A moment there and then gone
Like I was
Looking for a place to rest

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end
We all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the wheels
Biding the streets
Riding the wheels
Or biding the streets",2003,sad

Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly

Please tell me your second name, 
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are, 
I just need your star for a day

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny,

Your body limp beneath my feet
Your dusty eyes cold as clay

In a thunderstorm above the clouds

Distort the painful truth
Present a fear and laugh at you
Leave you lost unsure removed
The must I feel to put it right
Put an end to naive faith
In slick successes avenue
The vacuum of save face

Direct words can turn lost minds
Towards some monster seed
Lyrics sung from pretty looks
Can on the reader feed
Be strong to check and recognise
The pretty face is all
But being used to sell you songs
That never say it all

The incident meets the senses
The illusions in a mask
The sun of a summer afternoon
Docility rocks the mask
Broken loose from moorings
In a flash the swell had passed
Towards the beach with unabated speed
Confessions of a mask",1986,sad

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
Is it a lady or is it a man 
Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

On my feet to chase it down 
The lights were spokes and rungs away 
I stumbled back and hit the floor 
Long shadows crawl beneath the door 
To a passage so poorly lit 
There's moths flying away from it 

Who am I tonight? La, da, da 
My hotel room won't remember me 
Darkness enter prison girls 
Pushing mops and kicking pails 
Now's my chance 
I clasp my chest 
And declare unto my audience 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

Prison girls are not impressed 
They're the ones that have to clean this mess 
They've traded more for cigarettes 
Than I've managed to express 

Filing past miles long 
The cheek is frozen to the floor 
The prison girls have filled their beds 
Their thoughts too dry above their heads 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes",2009,sad

Roses Blue,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/rosesblue.html,"I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue

To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to",1969,sad

She picked me up on Friday. 
Asked me if she reminded me of you. 
I just laughed and lit a cigarette, 
Said ""that's impossible to do."" 
My life's gotten simple since. 
And it fluctuates so much. 
Happy and sad and back again. 
I'm not crying out to much. 
Think about you all the time. 
It's strange and hard to deal. 
Think about you lying there. 
And those blankets lie so still. 
Nothing breathes here in the cold. 
Nothing moves or even smiles. 
I've been thinking some of suicide. 
But there's bars out here for miles. 
Sorry about the every kiss. 
Every kiss you wasted (bad / back)
I think the thing you said was true, 
I'm going to die alone and sad. 

The wind's feeling real these days. 
Yeah, baby, it hurt's me some. 
Never thought I'd feel so blue.

Your skin protected me from sunbeams
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact

I let go

You were always there to walk me home
With you not here, the streets I roam
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here

I would float here instead
But there's a calm under the waves

Crawling Up a Hill,Katie Melua,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katiemelua/crawlingupahill.html,"Every morning (a)bout half past eight, 
My Mummer wakes me says, 
""Don't be late"", 
Get to the office, tryin' to concentrate, 
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill. 

So I stop one day to figure it out, 
I'll quit my job without a shadow of a doubt, 
To sing the blues that I know about, 
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill. 

Minute after minute, 
Second after second, 
Hour after hour goes by, 
Working for a rich girl, 
Staying just a poor girl, 
Never stop to wonder why. 

So here I am in London town, 
A better scene IÃ¼m gonna be around, 
The kind of music that won't bring me down, 
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill.

Stay Together,Suede,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/suede/staytogether.html,"Come to my house tonight,
We can be together in the nuclear sky.

We can stay a while in heaven today.

Stay together
And say, these days ??

Stay together
Two hearts under the skies remain.

There's a time bomb in the high ?life?
There's a blue suburban dream.
Will I see you up in paradise?
Or have you come to touch me?

Come to my arms tonight,
You and me together on electric light.
She will dance in the poisoned air,
Just you and me forever by the motorway ??

Come to my arms or not,
Just you and me together in the year of the hawk.
Single file in the nuclear night,
And we can feel a little closer as we tumble through the sky.

Sad Professor,R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/sadprofessor.html,"If we're talking about love
Then I have to tell you
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.

This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Suicide Underground,Air,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/air/suicideunderground.html,"Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood 
from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped out elms,
and the harsh sunlight. 

Some thought the tortures tearing the Lisbon girls
pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world 
as it was handed down to them.
So full of flaws.

But the only thing we are certain of 
after all these years,
is the insufficiency of explanation.
(Obviously, doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl.)

The Lisbon girls were
13 - Cecilia
14 - Lux
15 - Bonnie
16 - Mary 
and 17 - Therese.

No one could understand how 
Mrs Lisbon and Mr Lisbon, 
our math teacher, 
had produced such beautiful creatures.

From that time on
The Lisbon house began to change.
Almost everyday
and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on a towel,
wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife sharpener
to give her a 15 minute demonstration for free.

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
was Trip Fontaine.
Who only 18 months before the suicides,
had emerged from baby fat, 
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
and Mrs Lisbon shut the house in maximum security isolation.

The girls' only contact with the outside world
was through the catalogs they ordered,
that started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
with pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.

Unable to go anywhere,
the girls traveled in their imaginations.
To gold tipped Siamese temples, or past an old man with a leaf broom,
tiding a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

And Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

Collecting everything we could of theirs,
we couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds.
But they were slipping away.
The colours of their eyes were fading
along with exact locations of moles and dimples.

From 5 they had become 4,
and they were all, the living and the dead,
becoming shadows. 

We would have lost them completely 
if the girls hadn't contacted us.

Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house we had forgot to stop at the garage.

After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr Hedly pack up the house,
selling what furniture he could in a garage sale.

Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
and they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.

We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been.
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them.
And they hadn't heard us calling..still do not hear us,
calling them out of those rooms.
Where they went to be alone for all time.

Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper then death.
And where we will never find the pieces,
to put them back together.",,sad

Give me a lie

Twice the encouragement
Of the real you
Callie if you really want me to
I can always get you down
If you got the money for me
Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Making amends for distant wrong
Sincere
You can run away
Leave your books behind you
But you should look back twice
Just to be on the safe side
From my boat I can see your house
But now the lights are off
And there is no one home
You are just like an avalanche
Cold as I might have guessed
But at least I'm covered up for now
In a big, big way
I am really small
I get off my feet
But I'm still distant
Don't you just love goodbyes?
Callie let us get it over with
I can always get you down
If you got the money for me
Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Most of our lives we try so hard
To find the time
I won't care for you
Like I'm really supposed to
There are things I'll do
That could really hurt you
Don't you just love goodbyes?

Useless history 
Unexamined failure

Some thief who stole from you? 
Or, some fool drama queen 
Whose chances were few? 

That brings us to who we need 
A place where we can save 
A heart that beats as 
Both siphon and reservoir 

You're a woman, I'm a calf 
You're a window, I'm a knife 
We come together 
Making chance in the starlight 

Meet me tomorrow night 
Or any day you want

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

Pathetic oblivion
Forgotten hopes buried in your soul's lonely grave
Pathetic oblivion
Remember how you were before you locked your heart away

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?

And smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door

See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
I can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact it's been a wasted worried year

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long

Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out (let it all out) let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream
And shout and say things
That are so unkind

Yeah
See if I care
And see if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind
And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

That when the time comes
I'd take you away

So busy out there

was somebody who cares

I'm sinking slowly

Cause I can tell you once were pretty

Lost the luster off your tattle-tales

I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
Time has lost its hold on me

Hatred sleeps inside my bones
In the stillness of cool air
All the boys have been left for dead
Cause we go where they fear to tread
The beautiful ones the ones we'll remember
The precious ones our greatest pretenders

I need a love to help me find my way
I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover

And if you lose yourself
Could you take me, too?
Could you rest inside the sleep?

Jupiter Crash,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/jupitercrash.html,"She follows me down to the sound of the sea
Slips to the sand and stares up at me

Is this how a star falls?
Is this how a star falls?""

The night turns as I try to explain
Irresistable attraction and orbital plane
""or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame?""
She brushes my face with her smile
""forget about stars for a while... ""
As she melts...

Meanwhile millions of miles away in space
The incoming comet brushes jupiter's face
And disappears away with barely a trace...

""was that it? was that the jupiter show?
It kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for you know... ""
And pulling away she stands up slow
And round her the night turns
Round her the night turns...

Yeah that was it
That was the jupiter crash
Drawn too close and gone in a flash
Just a few bruises in the region of the splash...

She left to the sound of the sea
She just drifted away from me
So much for gravity...",1996,sad

My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore

Without a life vest I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim

Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be

Let the hurricane set in motion... yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down

Let the rain come down

Where is the coastguard
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
How can I keep up this breathing

Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion... yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down

I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow (yeah)
Just to prove that I knew how (yeah)

The loss of her, the one I love

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/dayisdone.html,"When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.",1969,sad

Don't push your luck too far

Since nineteen thirty-one

But it's been a heavy load
Carrying His precious love
Down a long dirt road
We're a long way from home
Just let's pay the man and go

He leadeth me in pastures green

Our daily bread and gasoline
Go under the willow
Park her up beside the stream

What others so discretely

I'm gonna watch them pass me by

What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

That cause the smallest taste
Of what will be

I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions

through the woods she set on foot
With a sacred blade cut the berries down
Dug up the dreaded mandrake root

Tread my path to summer's end
This bequest I leave you she says
You will see what could be evergreen
Turn to copper and fade to gray

By the standing stones
Atropine eyes smiled at me
Sitting in a sluggish vertigo
Sands of time form another dream
No love without sacrifice
No life springs without decay
The final kiss is a wormy one
In soils cold caress to rest we'll lay

Blood,The Middle East,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/middleeast/blood.html,"Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And youâll hear your sister sleep talking

Home to me
But your beard
Someday might beâ

And she woke up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
Sheâll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, youâll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings

Oh, and youâll find somebody you can blame
And youâll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And youâll find the peace of the Lord.

Grandfather, weary soul, youâll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
Youâve waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And thereâs nothing you can do about it now",P:  ,sad

A cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

Even though I don't have anything that I could bargain with.

This is like a well-oiled machine. Could I please see that smile again?
It's all that makes me feel that I am living in this world
I see you closing all the doors. I see the walls as they go up
I know it's what you have to do. I'd probably do the same thing, too, my dear.

Baby, you're where dreams go to die.
I regret the day your lovely carcass caught my eye.
Baby, you're where dreams go to die.
I've got to get away. I don't want to, but I have to try.
Oh, baby!

You have to play your part, my dear. I've written it all down for you.
It doesn't matter if the things you say to me aren't true.
Just do it then I'll let you go. Just say the words and say them slowly.
I promise I'll tell no one. Yes, I cross my heart and hope to die

Baby, you're where dreams go to die.
I regret the day your lovely carcass caught my eye.
Baby, you're where dreams go to die.
I've got to get away. I don't want to, but I have to try.
Oh, baby!

Over And Over,Moloko,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moloko/overandover.html,"No I won't interfere
I'm the only sound you'll ever need to hear
Listen to my breath so near
Allow me to be every noise in your ear

Since that day I wake up early
Every morning which is good
But my stomach's churning, call me,
It would be nice if you could

Some days I question
The suggestion
You might not exist at all
Can we meet and talk it over
Would you be kind enough to call

Over and over
It's over all over
And over and over and over
And over.....

No there's no middle ground
Your off in another story
Or merry-go-round

No there'll be no measured terms
You fly in the face of the way the world turns

Like a frozen tidal wave
Since that day I'm standing still
You brought me here and I accept
Though you regret I never will

Just one sweet word
And then a smile from you
Is almost worth everything
I've given all I had to give
But you gave up giving in

You are everywhere I go
All the places we have been
I can't imagine where you are
For you are all I've ever seen

Over and over.....

All I've ever known
All I've ever seen
Places that I go
Places that we've been",2003,sad
Celestica,Crystal Castles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/crystalcastles/celestica.html,"As we fall into sequence
and we're eating our young
remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
and they can't help you now
do you pray with your eyes closed naturally

Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

If I'm lost please don't find me
if I jump let me sink
we descended from no one
with a wink

When it's cold outside hold me
don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me
don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
don't coax me

Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

Have they cleansed you with chloride
and scrubbed behind the knees
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze",2010,sad
No Expectations,Soulsavers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulsavers/noexpectations.html,"Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again

Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
It's here, and then it's gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again",2007,sad
The Kindness of Strangers,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/thekindnessofstrangers.html,"They found Mary Bellows cuffed to the bed
With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows 
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor
She left her home in Arkansas
O poor Mary Bellows 
She wanted to see the deep blue sea
She travelled across Tennessee
O poor Mary Bellows 
She met a man along the way
He introduced himself as Richard Slade
O poor Mary Bellows 
Poor Mary thought that she might die
When she saw the ocean for the first time
O poor Mary Bellows 
She checked into a cheap little place
Richard Slade carried in her old suitcase
O poor Mary Bellows 
""I'm a good girl, sir"", she said to him
I couldn't possibly permit you in
O poor Mary Bellows 
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
And turned away without goodbye
O poor Mary Bellows 
She sat on her bed and thought of home
With the sea breeze whistling all alone
O poor Mary Bellows 
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
And undid the latch on the front door
O poor Mary Bellows 
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows 
So mothers keep your girls at home
Don't let them journey all alone
Tell them this world is full of danger
And to shun the company of strangers
O poor Mary Bellows

Plead I don't leave you alone
The demi-gods and hungry ghosts
God, god knows I'm not at home

I'll never find someone quite like you again
I'll never find someone quite like you again

I, I looked into your eyes and saw 
A world that does not exist
I looked into your eyes
And saw a world I wish I was in

I'll never love someone quite the way that I loved you",1998,sad

You can hold my heart for ransom
But you'll never own my soul

Maybe I might lose my head
But one thing I'll never do
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you
Baby, I'm burning our bed

There used to be a time when you were everything
My flame thru the night
You got me hot
Then you blew me out
Like this match I'm about to light

Oh, oh, oh
You can tear my heart to pieces
Left me standing in the cold

Baby, I might lose my mind
Maybe I might lose my head
One thing I gotta do
Is torch those sheets and pillows too
Baby, I'm burning out bed

Well, I used to think your were so fine
How could I be so blind

Oh, oh, oh
I'm freem
But I'm alone

Gloomy Sunday,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/gloomysunday.html,"Sunday is Gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy
with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday",,sad
A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/ahardrainsagonnafall.html,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, that roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall",1963,sad

If you know the way to blue?

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
If you know the way to blue?

Look through time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind.

Can you now recall all that you have known?
Will you never fall
When the light has flown?

'Cello Song,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/cellosong.html,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969,sad
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/maninashed.html,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969,sad

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo

Cannot remember it well enough, only the details such, then I see it in my head,
When I am with you its familiar and beautiful, and ?

As night comes in I know it better, seeing it clear again

Look after me and I will look after you
Thats something we both forgot to do

Cus if I squint then I see your so, far from me, far from me
As if my miralce I see the room I see ?

The words and images they come back to me, back to me
Crystal clear in my head, but its behind the screen

Look after me and I will look after you

Atrocity Exhibition,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/atrocityexhibition.html,"Asylums with doors open wide,
Where people had paid to see inside,
For entertainment they watch his body twist,
Behind his eyes he says, 'I still exist.'

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

In arenas he kills for a prize,
Wins a minute to add to his life.
But the sickness is drowned by cries for more,
Pray to God, make it quick, watch him fall.

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

You'll see the horrors of a faraway place,
Meet the architects of law face to face.
See mass murder on a scale you've never seen,
And all the ones who try hard to succeed.

This is the way, step inside.
This is the way, step inside...

And I picked on the whims of a thousand or more,
Still pursuing the path that's been buried for years,
All the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire,
Can't replace or relate, can't release or repair,
Take my hand and I'll show you what was and will be.",1980,sad
Summer '68,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/summer68.html,"Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you
I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago
The music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

Not a single word was said
The night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon - in a room of ninety five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man

Just to let me know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?

A small blue thing
Like a marble
Or an eye

With my knees against my mouth
I am perfectly round
I am watching you

I am cold against your skin
You are perfectly reflected
I am lost inside your pocket
I am lost against
Your fingers

I am falling down the stairs
I am skipping on the sidewalk
I am thrown against the sky

I am raining down in pieces
I am scattering like light
Scattering like light
Scattering like light

Today I am
A small blue thing
Made of china
Made of glass

I am cool and smooth and curious
I never blink
I am turning in your hand
Turning in your hand
Small blue thing",1985,sad

Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now 
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate 
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow 
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us 
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too 
But they can't touch me now 
And you can't touch me now 
They ain't gonna do to me 
What I watched them do to you

All down the line 
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day this time 

Now I don't know what it always was with us 
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines 
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us 
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind 

Well say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day all boys must run away 
So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
All men must make their way come Independence Day 

Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint 
And the highway she's deserted clear down to Breaker's Point 
There's a lot of people leaving town now 
leaving their friends, their homes 
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone 

Well Papa go to bed now, it's getting late 
Nothing we can say can change anything now 
Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways 
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away

But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day

Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
And undid an extra button on her blouse
He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am
He was staring at the ceiling
He couldn't move his hands

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said ""Johnny Welcome Home""
Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome
His mama said ""Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me""
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light

Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
In the cold black water Johnson Leneir stands
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been

Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light",,sad

Anna Begins,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/annabegins.html,"My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
I am not worried,
I am not overly concerned

My friend implored me,
""For one time only
Make an exception.""
I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried 
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
""Oh"", she says, ""you're changing.""
We're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love

Because if you don't want to talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess I'm gonna have to live without
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me,
""It's all or nothing.""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things
You try to tell yourself to make yourself forget
To make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" she said,
""Then we're gonna have to think about the consequences""
But she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering
For days,"" she says.
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend.
And I'm not gonna break and
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say,
""As long as this is love...""
But it's not all that easy
So maybe I should 
Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause I've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
But I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind
Every time she sneezes I believe it's love
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand
And, oh, Lord, I m not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away.
She disappears,
And, oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing",1993,sad

Don't have no God to teach me no lessons

Go to work in the rain 
I don't know why 
Don't know why

The Weakness In Me,Joan Armatrading,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joanarmatrading/theweaknessinme.html,"I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you get my attention

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly

Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep
If I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
And I need you, and you

Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you, tightly",1981,sad

With its snow and sleet
And me with hunger
And cold feet
Who says ""Here's two bits, go and eat""?
Nobody

Well, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time

All warm and clear
And my friends see me
Drawin' near
Who says ""Come on in and have a beer""?

Well, one time when things was lookin' bright
I started to whittlin' on a stick one night
Who said ""Hey! That's dynamite!""?

I was falling falling deep 
You were there you were small 
There was screaming down the hall

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There comes a time we all know 
There's a place that we must go
Into the soul into the heart 
Into the dark 

There was fire there was death
There was lying on your breath
I turned away I would pretend 
But the burning never ends 

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There was a wave over the house 
There was fear choked in my mouth 
You were there you left your mark 
As I stumbled in the dark",1999,sad

Lost Unto this World,Emmylou Harris,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/emmylouharris/lostuntothisworld.html,"I was once some mother's darlin'
Some daddy's little girl
More precious than the ruby
More cherished than the pearl
My heart was full of mercy
And my forehead full of curl
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world
I am lost unto this world...

They herded me like cattle
Cut me down like corn
Took me from my babies
Before they could be born
You can blame it on the famine
You can blame it on the war
You can blame it on the devil
It don't matter anymore
I am lost unto this world...

I was tortured in the desert
I was raped out on the piain
I was murdered by the high way
And my cries went up in vain
My blood is on the mountain
My blood is on the sand
My blood runs in the river
That now washes thru their hands
I am lost unto this world...
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil
Was God the only one there watching
And weeping as l feil
O you among the living
Will you remember me at all
Will you write my name out
With a single finger scrawl
Across a broken window
In some long forgotten wall
That goes stretching out forever
Where the tears of heaven fall
I am lost unto this world...",2003,sad
Song for the Angels,Great Lake Swimmers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatlakeswimmers/songfortheangels.html,"The echo to your yell
The ripple to your dive
The currents under your wave

Electricity 
Flows through me
I send it out to you
We were charged 
With the founding poles
Of a million years
A million years
Before us 
Have trembled in their fears

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you where there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

I know that I am just a grain of sand
Meeting water at the land
We could make our castles here
And sweep them all away

I know that I am just a drop of water
Frozen into ice on the stormy earth 
Who gave us birth
Over and over in cycles 
Lovely cycles

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

Never saw you never heard you
But I knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me",2005,sad
Waiting for Love,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/waitingforlove.html,"[Verse 1]
She looks to the sun 
Help her to carry on
Braking down all the years 
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky 
Counting the reasons why 
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past

[B-Section]
All the changes, and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says

[Verse 2]
She looks to the stars
Breaking, time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

[B-Section]
And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
A she is starting to drown

[Chorus]
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
Waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long

[Verse 3]
She prays to the Gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where I am today
Life is looking very grey

[B-Section]
All the changes, all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm waiting for a new day to rise
COnversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And I want it, and I need it, and I'll leave it all behind

And all the changes I've made
And I remember the words, that you'll never say

[Chorus (3x)]

She looks to the sun",2003,sad

Violetta, keep your man locked up
Or like cio-cio
You will end up burned by love or sickness

And why don't you ladies believe me when i'm screaming
I always believe you

There is a knock at the door
Tell me it's not mimi again
Or is it Gilda's waiting passion to be stabbed and killed again

Katya kabanova, why did you marry him?
You knew his mother was a bitch
And would keep hold of him

Without a single place to go of interest 
And I'm further North than South

In restless walks she'll prowl the night;

The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old.",1966,sad

Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing

Withholding the rest
So I can be free what you want to see
I got the gesture and sound
Got the timing down
It's uncanny, yeah, you think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent
Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck
I do the best imitation of myself

The ""problem with you"" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
The best imitation of myself",1995,sad

Its funny how me, fucking her about,
Has got me in this fucking mess

Liar liar pants on fire
Lies alibis lies more alibis
From the truth, I admit I'm more than shy
Ain't the the times we are living in
Everybody's doing it so why cant i?

I tally up tonight's strangers
And stragglers that I've kissed
Training ground notches, perfectly executed notches
And near misses
Its all about going out and getting pissed with eagle eyes
And sincerity bottom on my list
What's the story morning glory?
I feel so low and worthless

So this is where the outcome unfurls and the truth is being told
A cloud has gathered over my head and now i know
Infidelity and my good friend ecstasy doesn't work, it makes you worse
I'm feeling so guilty about the things i said to my mum when i was ten years old
I'm feeling so guilty about any old shit
And how I think my missus is fucking every guy that she looks at
This is it, the end was always coming and now its here

So this is the grande finale
The crescendo of demise
This is the happy ending
Where the bad guy goes down and dies
This is the end
With me on my knees and wondering why?
Cross my heart, hope to die
Its my own cheating heart that makes me cry",2008,sad

Circus people with hairy little hands
Hit it, boys, strike up the army band

How do you feel
How do you feel
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes

Fiery pianos wash up on a foggy coast
Squeaky old organs have given up the ghost
Fire them up and kill the piano birds
There's creaky old organs burning on the coast

How do you feel
How do you feel
I can't seem to breathe with a rusted metal heart
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes",2001,sad

With sweet violation

While i hope you all miss me 
And weep at my grave 
I imagine you'll pray some 
And give hope to the brave 
To the ones who have loved me 
And cared for me 
And who die when i tell them

Unforgivable Sinner,Lene Marlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lenemarlin/unforgivablesinner.html,"Kinda lose your sense of time
'Cause the days don't matter no more
All the feelings that you hide
Gonna tear you up inside
You hope she knows you tried

Follows you around all day
And you wake up soaking wet
'Cause between this world and eternity
There is a face you hope to see

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
But you can't hear those words
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
Unforgivable Sinner

You've been walking around in tears
No answers are there to get
You won't ever be the same
Someone cries and you're to blame

Struggling with a fight inside
Sorrow you'll defeat
The picture you see it won't disappear
Not unpleasant dreams or her voice you hear

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
But you can't hear those words
And now she's up there
Sings like an angel
Unforgivable Sinner

Maybe one time lost
But now you're found
Stand right up before
You hit the ground
Maybe one time lost
But now you're found
Stand right up before
You hit the ground - hit the ground

You know where you've sent her
You sure know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far
And now she's up there

The Mercy Seat,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/themercyseat.html,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.
And I'll say it again
I.. am.. not.. afraid.. to.. die.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand
tattooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that devil blood.

And the mercy seat is a-burning
And I think my head is flowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway, there was no proof
And nor a motive why.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A life for a life
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.

Now the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A eye for a eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm not afraid to lie.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.",1988,sad

Here no one sleeps, one lays up while the other lies down
Where no one sleeps, one lays up while the other lies down

We couldn't see what was coming

Shake your head it's empty
Shake your hips move your feet
Shake your head it's empty

Coughed out my heart in the last stall

Seasons can't last

Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away

A day just like today
With nobody else around

Friendships move on
Until the day
You can't get along

Handshakes unfold
And the way it goes
No one knows

Moments will pass
In the morning light

Seasons can't last
So there's just one thing
Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away

A day just like today
Stay, don't just walk away
With nobody else around

Seasons can't last

Pity the day that it has to end

Where We Would Be,Porcupine Tree,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/porcupinetree/wherewewouldbe.html,"[Written by Steven Wilson]

Tied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

If I could find you
And tell you about my life
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young",2000,sad

Putting all the vegetables away
that you bought at the grocery store today.

Suddenly everything has changed.

Driving home the sky accelerates.
And the clouds all form a geometric shape.
And it goes fast, you think of the past.

Suddenly everything has changed.

Putting all the clothes you washed away,
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate.
Then it goes fast, you think of the past.

Suddenly everything has changed.",,sad

They don't care, they think you're slime

You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised

After a while you know the style and that's enough to know they suck

I know it's sad but don't feel bad, they knew they had it coming

There's a statue of a girl.
She is standing near a well 
With a bucket bare and dry.

I went and looked her in the eyes 
And she turned me into sand.
This clumsy form that I despise 
It scattered easy in her hand.

And came to rest upon a beach, 
With a million others there.
We sat and waited for the sea 
To stretch out so that we could disappear 

Into the endlessness of blue,
Into the horror of the truth.
You see, we are far less than we knew.
Yeah, we are far less than we knew

But we knew what we could taste.
Girls found honey to drench our hands.
Men cut marble to mark our graves.
Said we'll need something to remind us of 
All the sweetness that has passed through us
(fresh sangria and lemon tea).
The priests dressed children for a choir
(white-robed small voices praise Him)
But found no joy in what was sung.
The funeral had begun 

In the middle of the day
When you drive home to your place 
From that job that makes you sleep
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake 

Long after night has come to claim 
Any light that still remains 
In the corner of the frame 
That you put around her face.

Two pills just weren't enough.
The alarm clock's going off 
But you're not waking up.
This isn't happening, happening, happening, 
Happening, happening. It is.",2000,sad

And i kept a distance... the complications cloud the postcards and blips through fiberoptics,
As the girls with the pigtails were running from little boys wearing bowties their parent bought...
""i'll catch you this time!""
Crashing through the parlor doors, what was your first reaction?
Screaming, drunk, disorderly... i'll tell you mine.
You were the one but i can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately.
Synapse to synapse...
The sneaky kids had attached beer cans to the bumper so they could drive up and down the main drag.
People would turn to see who's making the racket. it's not the first time.
When they lay down the fish will swim upstream and i'll contest but they won't listen when the casualty rate's near 100%,
And there isn't a pension for second best or for hardly moving...

Father Of Mine,Everclear,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everclear/fatherofmine.html,"Father of mine
Tell me where have you been
You know I just closed my eyes
My whole world disappeared
Father of mine
Take me back to the day
When I was still your golden boy
Back before you went away
I remember the blue skies, walking the block
I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk
You would take me to the movie
You would take me to the beach
Take me to a place inside that is so hard to reach
Father of mine
Tell me where did you go
You had the world inside your hand
But you did not seem to know
Father of mine
Tell me what do you see
When you look back at your wasted life and you don't see me
I was ten years old
Doing all that i could
It wasn't easy for me to be a scared white boy in a black neighborhood
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
With a five dollar bill
I never understood you then and I guess I never will
Daddy gave me a name
My dad he gave me a name
Then he walked away
Daddy gave me a name
Then he walked away
My dad gave me a name
Father of mine
Tell me where have you been
I just closed my eyes
And the world disappeared
Father of mine
Tell me how do you sleep
With the children you abandoned
And the wife I saw you beat
I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I am a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear I'm not going to let her know
All the pain I have known
Then he walked away
Daddy gave me a name
Then he walked away
My dad gave me a name
Then he walked away",1997,sad
Maid Of Bond Street,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/maidofbondstreet.html,"This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairs",1967,sad
Fewer Words,Badly Drawn Boy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/badlydrawnboy/fewerwords.html,"Bet you wish you knew what time it is
And it's clear that you don't
Understand a love that requires fewer words

But there's still hope
If we materialise the myth
Never trivialise the kiss
Oh it feels like there's no fire left in your eyes
This is how love dies
This is how love dies",2004,sad

When it is snowing out again
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer closer and dearer
Then again
Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter - I love you

Ill be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away
Andalucia castles and christians
Andalucia come to stay
You were lost, once before, on a day much like this
When you'd made up your mind not to come
And I couldn't persuade you
Or wait till tomorrow - or pass the time",1990,sad
Never Went to Church,The Streets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/streets/neverwenttochurch.html,"Two great European narcotics,
Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer

We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.

On your birthday when mom passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.

Put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but..
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.
Panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you

[Chorus]

I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away.
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.

I never cared about God when life was sailin' in the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mom says me and you are the same from the start.

I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.

[Chorus x2]

But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.

I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
You always said I should hedge my bets.",2006,sad

Out on the ocean sailing away,
I can hardly wait
To see you to come of age,

Just have to be patient,

A hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go
But in the meantime,

Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is what happens to you,
While you're busy making other plans,

Drowned World/Substitute for Love,Madonna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madonna/drownedworldsubstituteforlove.html,"I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

[Chorus:]

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

[chorus]

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion",1998,sad
The Next Time You Say Forever,Neko Case,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/thenexttimeyousayforever.html,"I hear the tiniest sparks in the tenderest sound. 
Diving music, drowning the sound. 
waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. 
And your fire flood alarm, and you tremble, and you stumble, and you scrape up your palms. 
I can't stay here to hold your hand. 
I've been away for so long. 
I've lost my taste for home, and that's a dirty fallow feeling.
To be the dangling ceiling. 
From the roof came crashing down. 
Peeling in the heat.
Vanish in the rain.
The next time you say forever, I'll punch you in your face. 
Just because you don't believe it, doesn't mean I didn't mean it.

You never know when I'll show you the never.",2009,sad

Hummin' along old dominion blues

It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And i guess i may never understand
The times that i live in
Are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now
And this train is just too slow
And i know i can walk along the tracks

Buried by desires and weakness

One fallen hero with a face like me?
And if I scream, could anybody hear me?

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where's the love to shelter me
Give me love, come set me free

Only love, love set me free
Set me free

fall through cloud

you watch them fall

where they've gone 
where they've gone 

watching as the sun goes down 
i sit inside this plane 
notice how the city lights

Singing Kathy's clown
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed
So she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

Now she's done, and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
'Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Can't you tell that it's well understood?

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

I'm here today, expect it to stay on, and on, and on
I'm tired, I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong

It's OK, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans
To just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

These Streets,Paolo Nutini,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paolonutini/thesestreets.html,"Cross the border
Into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour
Just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul 
from the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to delay this sadness
That creeps up my spine
And haunts me through the night

Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wandering around
With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody floods to their ideal place
And the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy

Violence,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/violence.html,"Six bottles went down the drain
One hour's a waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And afterâ¦and afterâ¦and after)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill meâ¦
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill meâ¦

Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

[Lady's voice:]
My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read your letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, yourself
I keep thinking of you darling
I keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way
So I could come home to see you
But things don't look too good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could miss any one person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer 'til I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life",2003,sad

It stretches on forever
I walk through this abyss of consciousness
Relying only on my heartbeat when I face you
The open blue reflecting eternal possibility
The words we exchange intertwine
A melancholy figure, hanging heavily
Surfaces in my mind
There must be a heart there
Soon noise will drown it out
Returning to the concealed light
My voice raised, yearning to go back
White waves stop quietly
The song of the clouds breaking the surface
Letters of promise to the insane sunlight
I gaze at the fragments of thought spread out at my feet
Tears of hope for those unfulfilled
To whom do the stars belong?
Someday this sadness' end
Will be returned to us and the story will continue
Silhouettes reflected in my eyes
Countless faint smiles lined up before me
Gazing towards the exit
This beloved landscape
A vision brings
An instant of whiteness and the palm of my hand
All exists within one stride
Bells sound the arrival of the flood
The bridge of the sky and the clamour of twilight
I pass through this night in silence
I extinguish my lamp and in the moonlit street
Give an innocent smile for the happiness to come",2006,sad
Solitary,VNV Nation,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vnvnation/solitary.html,"Set me aflame and cast me free
Away, you wretched world of tethers
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more
Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

In this picture stands a man
Far away, alone and distant
Like a solitary field
In some nameless foreign land
All around him points of light
Start to dim and cease transmitting
Shadows fell on futile games
And then there was nothing more
Through the screams of falling steel
By the light of flares and wisdom
All the doubts I could not face
All this time I wanted more
With a line I mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
To the Gods whose names we've lost
And the names who gave in vain

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever

I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past

Before the faceless name of justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

Sever the line to the guilty past
To the ones who brought us nothing
Spoke of futures brave and proud
And brought only hate and war
Line the roads with hollow praise
Mark the land with paper statues
Shadows fell on their futile ways
And then there was nothing more",1998,sad
Black Heart,Calexico,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/calexico/blackheart.html,"Spring is frozen now I'm stuck in low
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
Can't find no poison, now I've got no cure
(the) fangs are stuck inside my skin

Payne county line
Watching unjust claims
One man's righteousness is another man's
Long haul, sentence carried out
Long haul, counting the miles
To the four corners of the world

Spring is rusted shut, (faith's) coiled and cracked
Apparitions worth their weight in gold
Scratched in metal, name erodes away
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
Burnt though, and ashen

Trip on fence post line
Sifting through the remains
One man's close pursuit is another man's
Last chance, make it through the divide
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this
Black heart, sweeping over the land
Black heart, crawling its way
To the four corners of the world",2003,sad
I Fell in Love With a Dead Boy,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/ifellinlovewithadeadboy.html,"I find you
With red tears in your eyes
I ask you what is your name
You offer no reply

Should I call a doctor
For I fear that you might be dead
But I just lay down beside you
And held your head

I fell in love with you
Now you're my one and only
Cause all my life I've been so blue
But in that moment you fulfilled me

Now I tell all my friends
I fell in love with a dead boy
And I tell my family
I wish you could have met him

I write letters to Australia
I throw a bottle out to sea
And I whisper the secret in the ground
No one's gonna take you away from me

I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy
And I fell in love with a dead boy
Ooh, such a beautiful boy

Oh, such a beautiful boy
I ask him, ""Are you a boy or a girl
Are you a boy or a girl""

Are you a boy or are you a girl
Are you a boy or are you a girl
Are you a boy or are you a girl",P:  ,sad

Everything was about you

I took a chance to call you my own
I didn't know a thing about you

Thought you could love
What a fool I was

What's going on
I was just singing my song
There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldn't I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldn't stand to chance without you

You said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldn't believe it

And on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

Thought there was love
What a fool I was

And everything was in hyper-jinx
Just like an old time movie

You don't understand
Can't comprehend

I guess it doesn't really matter

And every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

I thought I was loved
What a fool I was

When Sorrow Sang,Blind Guardian,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindguardian/whensorrowsang.html,"So let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back light and hope for all

And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand

Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) hope's turned to dust
At all

Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon

[Chorus:]
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet

I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye

Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her

So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind

The Carpenter,Nightwish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nightwish/thecarpenter.html,"Who are you?
Man condemned to shine a salvation

Why ?
Was the wine of the grail
too sour for man to drink

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter

The one they lick
The same old sick
dream of their precious saviour

Kiss them deep and

make them weep
over promises of eternal peace

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter

I hear you
through the symphonic voices of nature
- the purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
and observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds

The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died

To Live Is to Hide,Lacuna Coil,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/toliveistohide.html,"[Music: Coti Zelati/Lyrics: Scabbia - Ferro]

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking in their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause a blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

I'm going to freeze
Is it my imagination?
It's underground

But I can feel it the same

What I need now
What I need is to live to hide
When you smothered my devotion
With your lies

And I feel now
As I did that time
That I'm wondering why
Still I make you cry

While emotions try to come out
Desperately be seeking their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause to blow out
Desperately be seeking their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

Suffering while I'm depending on seasons
Roots under me are embracing the earth",2001,sad

Come and hide me from this terrible reality...

Dreaded memories flood back to me
But there's still a willful mind behind these cold
psychotic eyes
Now I tread this path so differently
I've opened my mind and darkened my entire life.

I'll dance with the angels to celebrate the holocaust,
And far beyond my far gone pride,
Is knowing that we'll soon be gone,
Knowing that I'll soon be gone...

As I walk out in the rain
Through the sepia showers
And the photo flood days

I caught a fleeting glimpse of life
And though the water's black as night
The colours of Scotland leave you young inside

There's a vision coming soon
Through the faith that cleans your wound
Hearts of olden glory will be renewed

Down the lens where the headlands stand
I feel a healing through this land
A cross for a people
Like wind through your hands

There must be a place under the sun
Where hearts of olden glory grow young",1987,sad
Send In The Clowns,Frank Sinatra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/sendintheclowns.html,"[Spoken intro]
This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent, oh, quite a long time
together, till one day
one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave. Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant.
It's a breakup.
It's a lovely marriage of words and music, written by Stephen Sondheim.

Isn't it rich? Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground and you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around and one who can't move
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted  was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair

Sure of my lines
Nobody's there

Don't you love a farce? My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want, sorry my dear
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Don't bother they're here

Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late in my career
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns
Well, maybe next year",ompi,sad
Cry! Cry! Cry!,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/crycrycry.html,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye, ""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.",1957,sad

A wintry eve
Once upon a tale
An Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrow's carol
Dreaming the stars

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

On a heaven's gate

Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born",1998,sad

Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
He said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
So, save your life
Because you've only got one

The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh but then again she left pain
So please save your life
Because you've only got one

Oh you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool

Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
`Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too

Stop twinkling your star like you do

And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come...

If I could do it again maybe just once more
Think I could make it work like I did it before

Every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break
And I shiver...

All the right answers
Under a sea of dust lies a vast wealth of wisdom

An untouched snow turns red
Innocence dies

This black page in history is not colourfast, will stain the next

Woken up from a dream
I saw a typhoon coming in close
Bringing the clouds down to the sea

Making the world look gray and alone
Taking all light from my view
Keeping everyone in
And keeping me here with you

Around you now
I can't sleep no more, baby
Around you still
Don't want to leave yet

Woken up from a dream last night
Somewhere lost in war
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
I didn't feel right anymore

I knew there I'd die alone
With no one to reach to
But an angel came down
And brought me back to you

I'd rather leave
This world forever, baby
Than let life go
The way it's going

Watching an old fight film last night
Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
But the pounding took to him

And there in the square he lay alone
Without face, without crown
And the angel who looked upon him
She never came down

You never know
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Out of the air
Out of nowhere

Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known

Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known

How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this 
M'I gonna heal from this; he won't admit to it 
Nothing to figure out; I gotta get him out 
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a 
Shit about me 
How many times can it escalate 
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe? 
And I must decide, if you must deride 
That I'm much obliged to up and go 
I'll idealize, then realize that it's no 
Sacrifice, because the price is paid, and 
There's nothing left to grieve 
Fuckin go- 
Cuz I've done what I could for you, and I do know what's 
Good for me and I'm not benefiting, instead 
I'm sitting singing again, singing again, singing again, 
Sing, sing, sing again 
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this 
M'I gonna heal from this; he won't admit to it 
Nothing to figure out; I gotta get him out 
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a 
Shit about me",1999,sad
View from Heaven,Yellowcard,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yellowcard/viewfromheaven.html,"i'm just so tired
wont you sing me to sleep
and fly through my dreams
so i can hitch a ride with you tonight
and get away from this place
have a new name and face
i just aint the same without you in my life
late night drives, all alone in my car
i can't help but start
singing lines from all our favorite songs
and melodies in the air 
singin life just aint fair
sometimes i still just can't believe you're gone
and im sure the view from heaven
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven,
maybe we'll make it through one more year 
down here

feel your fire, 
when its cold in my heart
and things sorta start
remindin' me of my last night with you
i only need one more day
just one more chance to say
i wish that i had gone up with you too
and i'm sure the view from heaven 
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven
maybe we'll make it through one more year 
down here

you wont be comin' back
and i didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
i really wish i got to say goodbye
and im sure the view from heaven 
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven 
maybe we'll make it through one more year
i hope that all is well in heaven
cause it's all shot to hell down here
i hope that i find you in heaven
cause i'm so...
lost without you down here
you wont be coming back
and i didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
i really wish i got to say gooooodbye",2003,sad
President of What?,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/presidentofwhat.html,"I saw the scene unfold on a rainy Sunday
Creases indicating folds that kept four walls from caving in
I took a little more of what I take for granted
And filled my plate with fear that gears would turn
And wheels would roll away

Something's got to break you down [x2]

Entered the scene (I'm told) on I think it was Monday
You drove straight through and mined that quarry
For all it could bleed 'til dry
I took a little more 'til I got taken for granted
'cause beautiful boys gave chase
And when they arch your backbone
It's such a dreadful sight

Something's got to break you down [x2]

[x2]
I'll react when faces find you
With jealous fits that gag and bind you
'cause nothing hurts like nothing at all
When imagination takes full control

I saw the scene unfold [x4]",emo ,sad
Two Headed Boy,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neutralmilkhotel/twoheadedboy.html,"Two headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Two headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep beside
Now your eyes ain't moving
Now they just lay there in their climb

Two headed boy
There is no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go",1998,sad
Lament,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/lament.html,"Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile

Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh the smell as candles die

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge",ompi,sad
Dream Brother,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/dreambrother.html,"There is a child sleeping near his twin 
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind 
That dark angel he is shuffling in 
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair 
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair 
Her green eyes blew goodbyes 
With her head in her hands 
and your kiss on the lips of another 
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world. 

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
Nobody ever came 
Nobody ever... 

I feel afraid and I call your name 
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain 
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another 
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 

Ah do you meet the one I love 
and smell the one who loves you 
Dream brother, dream brother, dream, dream
dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over",1994,sad
Blind,TV on the Radio,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tvontheradio/blind.html,"I seen a girl
With a guy
With hair like yours
From what I remember

He took her hand
And smiled her name
Her face like yours
She smiled the same

From what I remember
Been so long since last December
She walked your walk
She talked like you

She shimmered strong
She shined right through
From what I remember
I said I seen a girl

With a guy
So who I'd seen
So who am I
Now I can't remember


Been so long since last December
So I'm sending
Open letter to the perfect girlfriend

I'm still mighty tiny
Hoping that you'd be my little godsend
Because right now I'll take any and blindly
Before I find another noose to fit us

Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other
What's the difference
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Open letter to the legions leering
Oh, how we entertained you
Why don't you cast your gaze into the moonlit clearing

Cause my love, my love is a suckerbet
Before I find another noose to fit us
Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other

What's the problem
Why don't you save yourself 
I'll save you all the time
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time

Pulling Our Weight,The Radio Dept.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/radiodept/pullingourweight.html,"In time we might walk the straight line
But with memories of a grapevine
A guitar, as we came close from far
Forgot about the war
We barely touched
As if being watched

And even in time
Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line
Pulling our weight

Many miles from where Iâm sleeping
You share laughter in the evening
As do I, in the great divine
Yours is mine
Weâll find love
The kind weâre dreaming of

And even in time
Weâll give in to crime
Weâll be on the line
Pulling our weight",P:  ,sad

I must cave in
I have trouble forgetting those beautiful eyes
As it is
I must fill your space with lies

I guess I expected this song
And it is as it appeared
Like a fist in my stomach and swallowing tears
Your song turned out a sad one
Just as I feared",2005,sad

To pluck the feathers off all the birds

On your own
But you can not call it your all

We always wrung our heads too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your unknown

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy, but devil's plan
On your own
You can not call me your all

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
But you can not; you will not agree",2006,sad

Paint all your sorrows for me to sing

Draw your pain and hear me hum it out

Would you even take notice?

You just don't know that I am here

I pray now that soon you'll release
To where you belong

I cross the borders of time

Please, say my name
Remember who I am 
You will find me in the world of yesterday
You drift away again
To far from where I am

When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave

Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

We saw you making knots, we saw you get the rope

And the bubble of your interests ready to burst

He whistles and he runs

We saw you in distraction: a sleeping, slow despair
Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature âThough you wish you were the wind
â¦Ã Ã£ boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end

He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn, you want to let it last

He has a keen eye for what you used to be

When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead men
You cannot leave",2004,sad

As we listen to the freaks
As we wait for the right of way

Cos we surf our little souls away
We smoke as we choke
As we sink another Coke
And we grin when it blows our mind
We skate as we date
As we slowly suffocate

When summer slipped away
So chill now whoa

So take it day by day

To some forgotten dream and
How was I supposed to know
It wasn't what it seemed
And even though the last hello
Has left me on the floor
I don't believe in Romeos or heroes anymore

We spend as we lend
Cos we're happy to pretend
Everything's gonna be OK
We shake as we break
Never give until we take
And we hate when we have to pay
We flirt while we work
To forget about the hurt
And the trash that we left behind
We sink as we swim
The ice is wearing thin

Something,Al Green,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/algreen/something.html,"Something gotta hold on me
Something gotta hold on me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something is bothering me
(Softly)
Something kinda worrying me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something in that cloud in the sky
Something
Do you feel it passing by?
Whatever it is
Makes me wonder why
Sometimes I sit here and wonder why
Makes me wonder
Birds that fly in the sky
Wonder... They wonder why
Everyday, seasons passing by makes me..
I wonder why
Sometime in the evening it makes me sad",1976,sad
Cold Days from the Birdhouse,The Twilight Sad,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/twilightsad/colddaysfromthebirdhouse.html,"Another hotel with ruined plans
Romantic gesture with ruined plans
And so you make it your own but this is where your arm can't go
You make it your own
Another phone call with ruined plans
Romantic gesture with ruined plans
And so you make it your own but this is where your arm can't go
You make it your own but this is where your arm can't go

And your red sky at night won't follow me, it won't follow me now
I won't wear your shoes and I won't clip your wings

I see it when you lied, we all look so surprised
And will you come back? Will you come back?
And breathing in smoke signs like a puppet told to drive
And will you come back? Will you come back?

And your red sky at night won't follow me, it won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me, it won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me, it won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me, you won't follow me now

And where are your manners? So where are your manners?
And where are your manners? And where are your manners?
So where are your manners? And where are your manners?
And where are your manners? And where are your manners?

Detlef Schrempf,Band of Horses,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bandofhorses/detlefschrempf.html,"And take a little walk when the worst is to come
When I saw you looking like I never thought
And say you're at a loss or forgot that words can do more than harm

The town is gonna talk, but these people do not
See things through to the very minimal
But what's it gonna cost to be gone?
If we see you like I hoped we never would

When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way

So take it as a song or a lesson to learn
And sometime soon be better than you were
If you say you're gonna go, then be careful
And watch how you treat every living soul

My eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way",2007,sad
Laugh Before You Grin,Lydia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lydia/laughbeforeyougrin.html,"I'm begging for your hand, screaming at your face. 
Come with me kid we'll leave this place. 
I'm all yours because I hate this house 
and how sad it makes you in the morning, 
that I'm hoping will never come. 
I just want to watch this sky and some, 
stars, are out I do believe. 
And this winter came I think we made it through the freeze. 

Someday we'll drive away. 
And we'll cut up my face 'cause it's too plain. 
You are this! 
I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
I swear it's this town I will not see. 
Ha ha, ha, ha ha, I tricked you again. 

Anything but silence, anything you say 
will stay in my head for days and days. 
But I'm sorry we couldn't make it back this evening. 
But I'm still hoping. 
We have to move or so it seems. 
I guess the hospitals are near 'cause I can hear those screams, 
and you breathing over me. 
Well ha ha, ha, I tricked you once again 'cause you are nothing.

But I promise someday we'll drive away. 
And we'll cut up my face 'cause it's too plain. 
You are this! 

Well it's here, 
and your expensive taste 
that we should have framed this place. 
And kept it in your shelf. 
Next to you big city dreams. 
It's in your touch it seems. 
But you wear that on your sleeve, 
and all the thoughts that make you bleed. 

I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
I swear it's this town I'll never see again. 
If I have my way and time, just to sing. 
So go ahead kid we loved it. 
Sing it loud before the light hits, 
and we are forced to move. 
With your window up we can keep the light out
And you can keep the light out",2005,sad
(*Fin),Anberlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anberlin/fin.html,"Feels like you're miles from here, 
in other towns with lesser names.
Where the unholy ghost doesn't tell 
Mary or William exactly what they want to hear.
You remember the house on Ridge Road 
told you and the Devil to both just leave me alone.
If this is salvation, I can show you the trembling. 
You'll just have to trust me. I'm scared.

I am the patron saint of lost causes. 
Aren't we all to you just near lost causes? 
Aren't we all to you just lost

Tommy, you left behind 
something that will mean everything right before you die.
What if you gained the whole world? 
You've already lost four little souls from your life. 
Widows and orphans aren't hard to find.
They're home missing daddy who's saving the abandoned tonight.
Wish your drinking would hurry and kill you. 
Sympathy's better than having to tell you the truth.

That you are the patron saint of lost causes. 
All you are to them is now a lost cause. 
All you are to them is now, causes.

Billy, don't you understand? 
Timothy stood as long as he could and now 
you made his faith disappear. 
More like a magician and less like a man of the cloth.
We're not questioning God. 
Just those he chose to carry on His cross.
We're no better, you'll see. 
Just all of us, the lost causes.

Aren't we all to you just lost causes? 
Are we all to you lost?
Lost causes
So all we are to you,
Is all we are, is all we are
All we are is all we are

[Choir:]
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you? (Lost causes, all we are is all we are)
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you? (To you, lost...)

Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?

Take what you will, what you will
And leave. Could you kill, could you kill me
If the world was on fire 
and nothing was left but hope or desire 
And take all that I could bring forth, is this hell
Or am I on the floor over-desperate? 
Hold hands streaming of blood again?
And then take full weight of me 
Guard my dreams, figure this out, 
It's me on my own. Helpless, hurting, hell
Will you stay strong as you promised?
Cause I'm stranded and bare.
Meanness is washed up in all that I am 
is God. Take this and all,
Then grace takes me to a place 
Of the father you never had 
Ripping and breaking and tearing apart 
This is not heaven
This is my hell.",2007,sad
Murder in the City,The Avett Brothers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avettbrothers/murderinthecity.html,"If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over alarmed
I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both
In so many different ways""

If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list
Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name",P:  ,sad

Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now now
Before you turn around

Astair you're there and I'm still here
I swear I'm so confused
The signs you wear are making me
Feel like I'm the one to lose

But the canyons and the seas 
Are they just what you need
Or are they less than what
You'd expect to see

And if you're leaving well come 
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now, now

Before you turn around

99% Of Us Is Failure,Matthew Good,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matthewgood/99ofusisfailure.html,"I know that it's bad
That it's the kind that they can't operate on
And I know it's real slow, honey
Painful and real slow
Styrofoam coffee cups
And bagged drugs that never work enough
And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

When we were young
And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands
But when 99% of us is failure
There's no going back

And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

Blackbird come the break of dawn
The TV's on, I turn it off
Walk outside, get in the car
Stare at the wheel then fall apart

I get it all the time
Bright eyes to bat and hide behind
But I know they're just for show, honey
Painful and just for show
Black rooms to babysit
White halls to pace and wait for it
And I know it's too slow, honey
Painful and real slow

When we were young
And hit like hammers
I'd write the nails in your hands
When 99% of us is failure
There's no coming back

And I know its real slow, honey
Painful and real slow

Blackbird come the break of day

Walk outside look at the sky
Ask it to fall or tell you why",2007,sad

Mad World,Gary Jules,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garyjules/madworld.html,"All around me are familiar faces

Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles

Hurt,Johnny Cash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/hurt.html,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

A million miles away

I would find a way",2002,sad

And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found,

Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

Goodbye My Lover,James Blunt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesblunt/goodbyemylover.html,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun.
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.

So, I took what's mine by eternal right,
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there.
I am here for you if you'd only care.

You touched my heart, you touched my soul,
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind, and that I knew, when
My heart was blinded by you.

I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

Goodbye, my lover.
Goodbye, my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I am a dreamer,
And when I wake,
You can't break my spirit.
It's my dreams you take.

And as you move on,
Remember me,
Remember us,
And all we used to be.

I've seen you cry,
I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.

I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine.
And I love you,
I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.

When I'm kneeling at your feet.

Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?

Angel,Sarah McLachlan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahmclachlan/angel.html,"Spend all your time waiting
for that second chance
for a break that would make it okay
there's always some reason
to feel not good enough
and it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
oh beautiful release
memories seep from my veins
let me be empty
and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

in the arms of the angel
fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room
and the endlessness that you fear
you are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort here

so tired of the straight line
and everywhere you turn
there's vultures and thieves at your back
and the storm keeps on twisting
you keep on building the lies
that you make up for all that you lack
it don't make no difference
escaping one last time
it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

in the arms of the angel
fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room
and the endlessness that you fear
you are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort here
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort here",1997,sad

Couldn't look you in the eye

I'm a weirdo

I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special

Roads,Portishead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/portishead/roads.html,"Ohh, can't anybody see

Never found our way

From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong

Storm.. in the morning light

No more can I say
Frozen to myself

I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
And surely that ain't right

Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

To ever fall back in your arms

And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

Bruises that won't heal

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time

All the time
All the time",1995,sad

Brick,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/brick.html,"6 a.m., day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold
Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth""
And she broke down, and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment we're alone
But she's alone
And I'm alone
And now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly",1997,sad

They see you coming they see you go
They know your secrets and you know theirs
This town is crazy; nobody cares

I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause

There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
No one left to watch your back now
No one standing at your door
That's what you thought love was for

That you are here
It's the only way

What have I done
You seem to move on easy

My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want's to find an easy way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess

Sing.. us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

Now we are one in everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke

Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

I will make you hurt

When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

What Sarah Said,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/whatsarahsaid.html,"And it came to me then
That every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time
As I stared at my shoes
In the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409

And I rationed my breaths
As I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak
On the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines
And year-old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind
That our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds

And I knew that you were truth
I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around
At all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said
That ""Love is watching someone die""

So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?",2005,sad

Waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
I held my tongue as she told me
""Son, fear is the heart of love""
So I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks

Wipe my nose
Get my new boots on

I put my hand in my father's glove

I run off
Where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown

I hear a voice,

When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind

Boys get discovered
As winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun

Years go by
And I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was

Mirror mirror
Where's the crystal palace
But I only can see myself

Skating around the truth
Who I am
But I know, dad, the ice is getting thin

When you gonna make up your mind
When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind

'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change my dear

Hair is grey
And the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf

You say I wanted you
To be proud of me
I always wanted that myself

When you gonna make up your mind
When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind

'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a...

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone...",2004,sad
Eleanor Rigby,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/eleanorrigby.html,"Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?",1966,sad
Hope There's Someone,Antony and the Johnsons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antonyandthejohnsons/hopetheressomeone.html,"Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

Hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired

There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How can I fall asleep at night?
How will I rest my head?

Oh I'm scared of the middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

There's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
If I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head?

So here's hoping I will not drown
Or paralyze in light
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

Hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired",2005,sad
Cannonball,Damien Rice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/damienrice/cannonball.html,"Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to say what's going on

Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on

Stones taught me to fly
Love â it taught me to lie
Life â it taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

Stones taught me to fly
Love â it taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon

Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
So come on, courage, teach me to be shy

It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow

For My Fallen Angel,My Dying Bride,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mydyingbride/formyfallenangel.html,"As I draw up my breath,
And silver fills my eyes.
I kiss her still,
For she will never rise.

On my weak body,
Lays her dying hand.
Through those meadows of Heaven,
Where we ran.

Like a thief in the night,
The wind blows so light.
It wars with my tears,
That won't dry for many years.

""Loves golden arrow
At her should have fled,
And not Deaths ebon dart
To strike her dead.""",1996,sad
Forget Her,Jeff Buckley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffbuckley/forgether.html,"While this town is busy sleeping,
All the noise has died away.
I walk the streets to stop my weeping,
'Cause she'll never change her ways.

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her.
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
Ooh, I think I've forgotten her now.

Her love is a rose, pale and dying.
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go.

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her.
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
She's somewhere out there now.

[Guitar Solo]

Well my tears falling down as I try to forget,
Her love was a joke from the day that we met.
All of the words, all of her men,
All of my pain when I think back to when.

Remember her hair as it shone in the sun,
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done.
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again.

But don't fool yourself,
She was heartache from the moment that you met her.
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
She's out there somewhere now.

Oh She was heartache from the day that I first met her.
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget you, somehow.

Wise Up,Aimee Mann,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aimeemann/wiseup.html,"It's not what you thought
When you first began it
You got what you want
Now you can hardly stand it, though

It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up

You're sure there's a cure
And you have finally found it
You think one drink
Will shrink you till you're underground
And living down
But it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up

Prepare a list for what you need
Before you sign away the deed
'Cause it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop

Till you wise up

You Could Be Happy,Snow Patrol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/youcouldbehappy.html,"You could be happy and I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go

And all the things that I wished I had not said
Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head

Is it too late to remind you how we were
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur

Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far

Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true

Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do

More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world",2006,sad
Last Kiss,Pearl Jam,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/lastkiss.html,"[Chorus:]
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road straight ahead,
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,
I'll never forget the sound that night.
The screaming tires, the busting glass,
The painful scream that I heard last.

[Chorus]

When I woke up, the rain was pouring down,
There were people standing all around.
Something warm flowing through my eyes,
But somehow I found my baby that night.

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said,
""Hold me darling just a little while.""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss,
I found the love that I knew I had missed.

Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,
I lost my love, my life that night.

Both Sides Now,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/bothsidesnow.html,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
They shake their heads, and they tell me I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life at all",1969,sad
Someone Like You,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/someonelikeyou.html,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"".

He's wearing your clothes
Head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did
But you idiot kid
You don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye
You're pulling him through

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out
6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Four more blocks plus the one in my brain
Down downstairs to the man
He's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself and I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want
So leave me alone
You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks

Casimir Pulaski Day,Sufjan Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sufjanstevens/casimirpulaskiday.html,"2, 3, 4

Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning, at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see his face
In the morning in the window

All the glory when he took our place
But he took my shoulders and he shook my face
And he takes and he takes and he takes",2005,sad

What are we living for?
Abandoned places.

Another hero,
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime.

Hold the line.
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

Show must go on.

My make-up may be flaking.

I'll leave it all to chance.

Another failed romance.

I guess I'm learning.
I must be warmer now.
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now.

Outside the dawn is breaking,
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
Inside my heart is breaking.
My make-up may be flaking,
But my smile still stays on.

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies.
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die.
I can fly, my friends.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
I'll face it with a grin.

When the water filled every hole.
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean,
Making islands where no island should go.
Oh no.

Those people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat.
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door have been silenced forever more.
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before

Miserable at Best,Mayday Parade,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maydayparade/miserableatbest.html,"Katie, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is
Letting go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(While across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home,
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes

And this'll be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(While across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best",2007,sad
Perfect Day,Lou Reed,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loureed/perfectday.html,"Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark
We go home

Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later a movie, too
And then home

Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

You're going to reap just what you sow

You're going to reap just what you sow",1972,sad
Comfortably Numb,Pink Floyd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/comfortablynumb.html,"Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb",1979,sad
Song to Say Goodbye,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/songtosaygoodbye.html,"You are one of God's mistakes,
You crying, tragic waste of skin,
I'm well aware of how it aches ,
And you still won't let me in.
Now I'm breaking down your door,
To try and save your swollen face ,
Though I don't like you anymore,
You lying, trying waste of space..

Before our innocence was lost,
You were always one of those ,
Blessed with lucky sevens ,
And the voice that made me cry .
My Oh My.

You were mother nature's son ,
Someone to whom I could relate ,
Your needle and your damage done,
Remains a sordid twist of fate.
Now I'm trying to wake you up ,
To pull you from the liquid sky ,
Coz if I don't we'll both end up ,
With just your song to say goodbye.
My Oh My.

A song to say goodbye,
A song to say goodbye ,
A song to say...

Before our innocence was lost,
You were always one of those,
Blessed with lucky sevens,
And the voice that made me cry.

It's a song to say goodbye.",2006,sad
Stop Crying Your Heart Out,Oasis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/stopcryingyourheartout.html,"Hold up

Behind Blue Eyes,Limp Bizkit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/limpbizkit/behindblueeyes.html,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do,
And I blame you!
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

To be defeated

And don't worry
I'm not telling lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance

Between the Bars,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/betweenthebars.html,"Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be
That you'll never see
The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now
And forget all about
The pressure of days
Do what I say
And I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there
With your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up one more time
And I'll make you mine
Keep you apart,
Deep in my heart
Separate from the rest,
Where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

The people you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still",1997,sad

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

Foolish Games,Jewel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jewel/foolishgames.html,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees, and

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart; and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone
Off track with you

Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

And these foolish games are tearing me
You're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You took your coat off
Stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that",1995,sad
The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot,Brand New,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brandnew/theboywhoblockedhisownshot.html,"If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand
Hope you find out what you are; already know what I am
And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again
You can tell me how vile I already know that I am
I'll grow old, start acting my age
It'll be a brand new day in a life that you hate
A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone
And it hurts a whole lot, but it's missed when it's gone

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget

If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of this state
You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way
And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out
It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds
So call it quits, or get a grip
You say you wanted a solution; you just wanted to be missed

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget
So you can forget, you can forget

You are calm and reposed
Let your beauty unfold
Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close
You are second-hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins
Holding on to yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain
You are the blood in my veins

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget",2003,sad
I'm OK,Christina Aguilera,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christinaaguilera/imok.html,"Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I've carried all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
For you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see next

Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love you gave
Every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday
And I'm OK
I'm OK",2002,sad

What do I say when it's all over

My Skin,Natalie Merchant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nataliemerchant/myskin.html,"Take a look at my body
Look at my hands
There's so much here
That I don't understand

Your face-saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them

'Cause I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

Well, contempt loves the silence
It thrives in the dark
With fine winding tendrils
That strangle the heart

They say that promises
Sweeten the blow
But I don't need them
No, I don't need them

I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

I'm a slow-dying flower
I'm a frost-killing hour
Sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Oh, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
Oh, I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel-sweet love of my life
Oh, I need this

I'm a slow-dying flower
Frost-killing hour
The sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Do you remember the way
That you touched me before?
All the trembling sweetness
I loved and adored?

Your face-saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them

I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel-sweet love of my life
Oh, I need this

Well, is it dark enough?
Can you see me?
Do you want me?
Can you reach me?
Or I'm leaving

Better shut your mouth
And hold your breath
You kiss me now
You catch your death

Oh, I need this",1998,sad

Right Where It Belongs,Nine Inch Nails,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nineinchnails/rightwhereitbelongs.html,"See the animal in his cage that you built

Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
See the safety of the life you have built
Everything where it belongs
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
And it's all
Right where it belongs

What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is it all you want it to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself
Find yourself afraid to see?

What if all the world's inside of your head
Just creations of your own?
Your devils and your gods
All the living and the dead
And you're really all alone?
You can live in this illusion
You can choose to believe
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
While you're hiding in the trees

What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you used to know

Konstantine,Something Corporate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/somethingcorporate/konstantine.html,"I can't imagine all the people that you know
And the places that you go
When the lights are turned down low
And I don't understand
All the things you've seen
But I'm slipping in between
You and your big dreams
It's always you in my big dreams

And you tell me
That it's over
But I can't stand here in a patch of four-leaf clover
And you're restless
And I'm naked
You gotta get out
You can't stand to see me shaking
No, could you let me go
I didn't think so

And you don't want to be here in the future
So you say
The present's just a pleasant
Interruption to the past
And you don't wanna look much closer
'Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed
And it did because of me

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone, no
And I'm sleeping in your living room
We don't have much room
To live

And I had dreams that I would learn to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rockstar
And there was hope in me
That I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
But I don't think I care
And if I hurt you then I'm sorry
To just this guilt has got the best of me

And then you bring me home
'Cause we both know what it's like to be alone, no
And I'm dreaming in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

And Konstantine is coming down the stairs
Doesn't she look good
Standing in her underwear?
And I've been thinking, what I've been thinking, you know
But she's been drinking
And it doesn't get me anywhere

And Konstantine came walking down the stairs
And all that I could do
Was touch her long blond hair
And I was thinking, what I was thinking ya know
But we've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere

This is because I can spell confusion with a K
It's hard to like it
It's to dying in another's arms
And why I had to try it

It's to Jimmy Eat World
And those nights in my car
But this time I'm alone
And I don't see those stars

I'm not your star
Isn't that what you said
What you thought this song meant
You thought this song meant

If this is what it takes
To lie in my mistakes
And live with what I did to you
And all the things I put you through

I always catch the clock it's 11:11
And now you wanna talk
It's not hard to dream
You'll always be my Konstantine

They'll never hurt you like I do
No, they'll never hurt you like I do
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

This is to a girl who got into my head
With all these pretty things she did
Hey baby, you know that you keep me up in bed

It's to a girl who got into my head
With all the fucked-up things I did
Hey maybe baby, you could keep me up in bed

My Konstantine
Spin around me like a dream
We played out on this movie screen
And I said
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I've miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you

God, I miss you

And then you bring me home
And we'll go to sleep but this time not alone
No no
And you'll kiss me in your living room
And you see, no, that I've been missing in my living room
'Cause it's all you, yeah this is what I miss, what I miss

We don't have much room
I said, does anybody really need that room?
Because we all need a little bit of room
To live

Famous Blue Raincoat,Leonard Cohen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/famousblueraincoat.html,"It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. 

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear 
Did you ever go clear? 

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older 
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
You'd been to the station to meet every train 
And you came home without Lili Marlene 

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life 
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. 

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth 
One more thin gypsy thief 
Well I see Jane's awake -- 

She sends her regards. 

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
What can I possibly say? 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me 
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free. 

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear --

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time

Well, think about the lonely people
Or think about the day she found you
Or lie to yourself
And see it all dissolve around you

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now

Lonely people tumble downwards
And my heart opens up to you

When she says she has no time

The Greatest,Cat Power,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catpower/thegreatest.html,"Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me

Melt me down
Into big black armour
Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honor
Lower me down
To culprit south
Make 'em wash a space in town
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the later parade

Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain
Any feeling

Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping

Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he's been here

No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
Only sadness

Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another families' turn to die
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness

There are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to accept their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate
Says, he has been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore

And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
Only sadness",2004,sad
Running Up That Hill,Placebo,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/placebo/runningupthathill.html,"It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?

You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby
There's so much hate for the ones we love
Tell me we both matter, don't we?

You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me, won't be unhappy
(If I only could, be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh

C'mon, baby
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could
Be running up that hill

Brothers in Arms,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/brothersinarms.html,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be

Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged high

And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die

But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",1985,sad
For No One,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/fornoone.html,"Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years",1966,sad
A Whiter Shade of Pale,Procol Harum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/procolharum/awhitershadeofpale.html,"We skipped the light fandango
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter shade of pale
She said, 'There is no reason
and the truth is plain to see.'
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well've been closed
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
though in truth we were at sea
so I took her by the looking glass
and forced her to agree
saying, 'You must be the mermaid
who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
that my anger straightway died
If music be the food of love
then laughter is its queen
and likewise if behind is in front
then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
and attacked the ocean bed",1995,sad
I'm with You,Avril Lavigne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avrillavigne/imwithyou.html,"I'm standing on a bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound

Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you

I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you

Oh why is everything so confusing
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah!

It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new

Take me somewhere new

But I want his wings
I can shine even in the darkness

Angel's wings carried him to me

Hush down now
Go to sleep
We were once
Perfect
Me and you
We'll never leave this room

You color my eyes red
Your loves not alive it's dead

When rivers turn to roads and lovers become trends

This absolution is always incomplete
It's always bittersweet

Bother,Stone Sour,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stonesour/bother.html,"Wish I was too dead to cry
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my creator
Masochists to which I cater
You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be 
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
my flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

[Solo: Corey]

Wish I'd died instead of lived
A zombie hides my face
Shell forgotten
with its memories
Diaries left
with cryptic entries

And you don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on:
I'll never live down my deceit",2003,sad
Atmosphere,Joy Division,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joydivision/atmosphere.html,"Walk in silence,
Don't walk away, in silence.
See the danger,
Always danger,
Endless talking,
Life rebuilding,
Don't walk away.

Walk in silence,
Don't turn away, in silence.
Your confusion,
My illusion,
Worn like a mask of self-hate,
Confronts and then dies.
Don't walk away.

People like you find it easy,
Naked to see,
Walking on air.
Hunting by the rivers,
Through the streets,
Every corner abandoned too soon,
Set down with due care.
Don't walk away, in silence,
Don't walk away.",ompi,sad
Warwick Avenue,Duffy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/duffy/warwickavenue.html,"When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little time
Promise me you won't step outta line

When I get to Warwick Avenue
Please drop the past and be true
Don't think we're okay, just because I'm here
You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta my mind lately
You think you're loving but I want to be free
Baby you've hurt me

When I get to Warwick Avenue
We'll spend an hour, but no more than two
Our only chance to speak once more
I showed you the answers, now here's the door

When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you baby that we're through

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta my mind lately
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby you've hurt me

All the days spent together, I wished for better
But I didn't want the train to come
Now it's departed
I'm broken hearted, seems like we never started
All those days spent together, when I wished for better
And I didn't want the train to come

You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby you've hurt me
You don't love me, I want to be free

I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lay on the floor
And they smell just like you,
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear will always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you",2007,sad

Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave 
I can't hide 
I cannot be 
Until you're resting here with me

And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

Si algÃºn dÃ­a decidieras
Alejarte nuevamente de aquÃ­

Adam's Song,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/adamssong.html,"I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all

I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again

You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone",1999,sad
