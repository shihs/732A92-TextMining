More Today Than Yesterday,Diana Ross,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianaross/moretodaythanyesterday.html,"I don't remember what day it was
I didn't notice what time it was
All I know is that I fell in love with you
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Every day's a new day in love with you
With each day comes a new way of loving you
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Oh, I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But, darling, not as much as tomorrow

Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away
Cupid, we don't need ya now, be on your way
I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger
And I always will be true
I know you feel the same way too

Oh, I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But only half as much as tomorrow

Every day's a new day, every time I love ya
Every way's a new way, every time I love ya
Every day's a new day, oh, how I love ya",2006
I Woke Up In A Car,Something Corporate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/somethingcorporate/iwokeupinacar.html,"i woke up in new york city 
from my sleep behind the wheel 
caught a train to Poughkeepsie
and time stood still 

she wrote me a letter from san diego 
to qualify her luck 
these flights connect through arizona 
but i think i'll stay stuck 

so here i am 
here i am 
well i woke up in a car 
i traced away the fog
so i could see the mississippi on her knees 
i've never been so lost 
i've never felt so much at home 
please write my folks and throw away my keys 
i woke up in a car 
i woke up in a car 

i met a girl who kept tattoos for homes 
that she had loved 
if i were her i'd paint my body 
until all my skin was gone 

she wrote me a letter as we passed through rockford 
she said she won't forget 
maybe i do maybe i don't 
but i know i haven't yet 

so here i am 
here i am 
well i woke up in a car 
i traced away the fog
so i could see the mississippi on her knees

i've never felt so much at home 
please write my folks and throw away my keys 
i woke up in a car 
i woke up in a car 

and maybe i could live forever 
if not ever i had known
that you'd be waiting here whenever i am all alone

but here i am

Southern Belles In London Sing,The Faint,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/faint/southernbellesinlondonsing.html,"Scarlet boots, the kiss of death
Patience and the end of it
Blended angels, whispered love
Countdown 'til it's gone, for long
Velvet voices, haunting slow
Darkened nooks, with bright decor
Georgian femmes are gone for weeks
Southern belles in london sing

I'm staring down the Eppley gate
Two more days before the plane arrives
And you'll be standing here with your smile
Carving up the lobby seats
Pushing down the caffeine drinks
Checking the arrival screens for yours

A hundred feet above the landing
There's a girl gliding down
She's floating toward me now
Her sleeves are all stretching out
And the jet is following behind

Wake up

London skids a grinding halt
Last night left to spend apart
Your bags are packed but now for home
Stories of the tour unfold
Booking Agents
Broken Nose
Butting heads with creeping dolts
Georgian Femmes are gone for weeks
Southern Belles in London Sing

Sunday Morning,No Doubt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nodoubt/sundaymorning.html,"Sappy pathetic little me 
That was the girl I used to be 
You had me on my knees 
I'd trade you places any day 
I'd never thought you could be that way 
But you looked like me on Sunday
You came in with the breeze 
On Sunday Morning 
You sure have changed since yesterday 
Without any warning 

I thought I knew you 
I thought I knew you 
I thought I knew you well... so well 

You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good but fit so strange 
Out of fashion so I can complain 

You came in with the breeze 
On Sunday Morning 
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning 

I thought I knew you 
I thought I knew you 
I thought I knew you well... so well 

I know who I am, but who are you? 
You're not looking like you used to 
You're on the other side of the mirror 
So nothing's looking quite as clear 

Thank you, for turning on the light 
Thank you, now you're the parasite 
I didn't think you had it in you 
And now, you're looking like I used to! 

You came in with the breeze 
On Sunday Morning

You cannot have me

I Only Want You,Eagles of Death Metal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eaglesofdeathmetal/ionlywantyou.html,"When I feel like you get too close I put you right down 
I never really leave I just slip away 
And it's not my purpose to break your spirit 
I'm not really interested in what's in your heart 
I don't want you to fall in love now so please don't start 

I only want you
I only want you
I only want you
I only want you

I know that it's terribly cruel but then I like it 
Because you tried to love me I just can't stay 
And I'm not gonna lie just to spare you feelings 
'Cause watching you suffer feels much better to me 
I'm about to lay destruction on you 
I'm not the lover man that you want me to be 
I said well... 

I only want you
I only want you
I only want you
I only want you

Now you see once you get too close 
I put you right down 
I never really leave I just slip away 
But it's not my purpose to break your spirit 
I'm not really interested in what's in your heart 
But now I have to lay destruction on you

1979,The Smashing Pumpkins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashingpumpkins/1979.html,"Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slipping dues down to see

That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below

Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules,
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around",1995
Monster Hospital,Metric,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/metric/monsterhospital.html,"Monster hospital, can you please release me? 
You hold my hands down, I've been bad. 
You hold my arms down, I've been bad. 
I've been bad, I've been bad. 

I fought the war but the war won

Monster movie, Daddy Warbucks up against Bobby Fuller
And he beat him hands down
Lead in the head
Put a little lead in his head. 

I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of god. 
I fought the war but the war won",2005
Take Your Mama,Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/takeyourmama.html,"When you grow up
Livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama
Takes a shine to her best son
Something different
All the girls they seem to like you
Cause you're handsome
Like to talk and a whole lot of fun

But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said

[Chorus]
Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt
That we're doing oh the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late
'cause baby you're a full grown man

It's a struggle
Livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer
Watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama
Heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you
That all she'd wanna do is cry

Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just been towed

Let It Rock,Kevin Rudolf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kevinrudolf/letitrock.html,"I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow

So you pray to God
To justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bet
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Kevin Rudolph]
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeah!
Wayne's World
Planet Rock

Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm something

Gotta Have You,The Weepies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weepies/gottahaveyou.html,"Gray, quiet and tired and mean
Picking at a worried seam
I try to make you mad at me over the phone.
Red eyes and fire and signs
I'm taken by a nursery rhyme
I want to make a ray of sunshine and never leave home

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine
No, no, no, no, no,
nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have you.

The road gets cold, there's no spring in the meadow this year
I'm the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears
Oh, such a prima donna, sorry for myself
But green, it is also summer
And I won't be warm 'til I'm lying in your arms

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine
No, no, no, no, no
Nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have you

I see it all through a telescope: guitar, suitcase, and a warm coat
Lying in the back of the blue boat, humming a tune...hmmmmmmm

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no wine
No, no, no, no, no
Nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have

No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine
No, no, no, no, no
Nothing else will do
I've gotta have you, I've gotta have you.

You Were Always the One,The Cribs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cribs/youwerealwaystheone.html,"I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out

Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get trouble with that

You're gonna get trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else

I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But yeah, like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping

Know what'll happen to me
I sentenced myself now a long long time ago
And I hope to be free
But I guess that you've heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one ...",2004

A Place In The Sun,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/aplaceinthesun.html,"Like a long lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun

He'll think about paint 
and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Happy Song,Boney M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boneym/happysong.html,"We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school.
Teachers here, teachers there,
Books and books, they are everywhere.

Come on boys, we need to dance, we have got a good chance.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:

Everybody, let's go to the ""King"",
We can dance there, dance and eat an ice-cream.
Everybody dancing all night long,
Try to do it, sing a happy song.

Music, dancing in the night, we can get so high,
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.

It's a sweeter happy song, we'll sing all night long.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:
Everybody, let's go to the ""King"",...

It's time to dance, it's time to sing, sing a happy song, a happy song.
Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.

Come on boys, we need to dance, we all have got a good, good chance.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more.
Music sound in the night, we all can get so high,
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.

We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school. ...
Come on boys, we need to dance, we have got a good chance. ...
Everybody, let's go to the ""King"". ...
Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.
Everybody, let's go to the ""King"",... - Everybody -",ompi
Crazy for You,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/crazyforyou.html,"Found myself today
Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you",2008
First Love,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/firstlove.html,"So little to say but so much time,
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind.
Please wear the face, the one where you smile,
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry.

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired.
I need to get away to feel again.
Try to understand why,
don't get so close to change my mind.
Please wipe that look out of your eyes,
it's bribing me to doubt myself;
Simply, it's tiring.

This love has dried up and stayed behind,
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide.
Excuse me first love, but we're through.
I need to taste a kiss from someone new.

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love",2008
The Road To Home,Amy Macdonald,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amymacdonald/theroadtohome.html,"Oh, the leaves are falling from the trees
And the snow is coming, don't you know?

I'm on the road, the road to home

Oh, the sound is fading in my ears
And I can't believe I've lasted all these years
But I'll still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home

Oh, the light is fading all the time
And this life I'm in, it seems to pass me by
But I'll still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home

Now I must say goodbye
Keep telling myself now don't you cry

I can tell you do
How can I explain
When you don't want me to

Kid, my only kid
You look so small, you've gone so quiet
I know you know what I'm about
I won't deny it
But you forgive though you don't understand
You've turned your head
You've dropped my hand

All my sorrow, all my blues
All my sorrow

Shut the light, go away
Full of grace, you cover your face

Kid, gracious kid
Your eyes are blue but you won't cry
I know, angry tears are too dear
You won't let them go",1980

Good Intentions,Toad The Wet Sprocket,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toadthewetsprocket/goodintentions.html,"It's hard to rely on my good intentions
When my head's full of things that I can't mention
Seems I usually get things right
But I can't understand what I did last night

It's hard to rely on my own good senses
When I miss so much that requires attention
Have to laugh at myself sometimes
And I can see that I'm not blind

There's little relief
Give us reprieve
For all the things I've left behind
I'm positive that I'm not blind

I'm not afraid things won't get better
But it feels like this has gone on forever
You have to cry with your own blue tears
Have to laugh with your own good cheer

It's hard to rely on my good intentions
When my head's full of things that I can't mention
Seems I usually get things right
But I can't understand what I did last night

There's little relief
Give us reprieve
Imagining the world outside
I'm positive that I'm not blind

I can't be hard on you
'cause you know I've been there too
Learned a lot of things from you

But life gives little relief
Give us reprieve
And when everyone is cold as ice
I clinch my fists and close my eyes
Imagining the world outside
But I can see that I'm not blind",ompi
Who Knows,Avril Lavigne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avrillavigne/whoknows.html,"Why do you look so familiar
I could swear that I have seen your face before

I think I like that you seem sincere

Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

How do you always have an opinion
And how do you always find the best way to compromise

We don't need anything
We're just wasting time

Do your best just keep on laughing

The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn),Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/thegreatestmanthateverlivedvariationsonashakerhymn.html,"You try to play it cool like you just don't care
But soon I'll be playin' in your underwear
I'm like a mage with the magic spell
You come like a dog when I ring your bell
I got the money and I got the fame
You've got the hots to ride on my plane
You've given me all that I desire
Cuz down with me I'm takin' you higher

I'm baddest of the bad
I'm the best that you've ever had
I'm the tops, I'm the king
All the girls get up when I sing
I'm the meanest in the place
Step up, I'll mess with your face
I don't care where you are
Look up and follow this star

I, I'm gonna tear down the wall
I may not be here when you call
So best be givin' me your all, oo hoo

After the havoc that I'm gonna wreak
No more words will critics have to speak
I've got the answers
To the tangled knot
Sleep tight in your cot

Oh baby, I've been told that I'm going crazy
Oh baby, well I can't be held down
Oh baby, somehow I'm keepin' it steady
Oh baby, I'm tearin' up this town

Hey, this is what I like
Cut my heart with a martyr's spike
Hey, this is nothing new
I've got more than enough for you

I can take on anybody
I can do my thing
I don't want to hurt nobody
But a bee has got to sting
I'mma fix it if you mix it up, hoo hoo
Talk smack and I'm-a-gonna shut you up, hoo hoo

I was born to give
I am the greatest man that ever lived
Oh radioactive

""Somebody said all the world's a stage and each of us is a player
That's what I've been trying to tell you
In act one, I was struggling to survive. Nobody wanted my action dead or alive
In act two, I hit the big time and bodies be all up on my behind
And I can't help myself cuz I was born to shine
If you don't like it, you can shove it. But you don't like it, you love it
So I'll be up here in a rage until they put the curtain down on the stage""

Let It Slide,Keane,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/keane/letitslide.html,"The same, always the same
Bitter words are all that remain
Of the dream that had taken you in

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide

Say, what's that you say?
Time to move on
And you're in the way
Let's get to the end
And not turn around
She built you up so she could knock you down

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
It's time to move aside
To let it slide

Friend, there's nothing there
You're clinging on to air
You're reaching back
To something that
You never had

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire
Why'd you never know?
The time to let go
The time to move aside

You promised you would love us, but you knew too much

Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction

No Man's Land,Sufjan Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sufjanstevens/nomansland.html,"Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours; this land is mine.
I see the Captain in red,
and Cairo at his head.
This land is yours; this land is mine.

The lightning over the park,
the waters--brash and dark
We take a swim; we take a swim.
I never meant to escape
the carpet and the trade
This land is yours; this land is mine.

And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back; I take it back.
The numbers over the dam,
Jo Davies and the band,
I count them out; I count them out.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
to the floor

The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
In Charles, we climb the hill 
and Danville window sill
I take it back; I take it back.
My sister she counts the bars,
the Macon county cars,
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.

The Mississippi amends
the Carver and the bends
This land is yours; this land is mine.
My brother punches my ear.
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad; I call my dad.
We skip inside of the store
the Mason winter door
This land is yours; this land is mine.

There was a car in the bay
by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
in the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

For the right hand takes what it can,
ransacks with the mad man.
For this land is not yours or mine to have.
This land was made for the good of itself.)",2006
Freckles,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/freckles.html,"I used to care so much about what others think about
Almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark
On the journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
If I knew then what I know now
I would have told myself don't worry any longer it's OK

[Chorus:]
'cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable,
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me
Sometimes I still feel like the little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm getting better
And I'm reminding myself

[Chorus]

Reflecting who you are
Reflecting who you are
Hmmm
Whoooooo whoa hmmmm oooooo

Well you're wrapped up in a blanket and you're staring at the floor
The conversation's moderated by the noisy streets below
I never wanna hurt you baby, I'm just a mess with a name and a price
And now I'm drunker than before they told me drinking doesn't make me nice

You never know where some people will go
Yeah some people been hurtin' me
You can tell by look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or the blink of an eye

Well then we'll see what they say and we'll do what they do
But that doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Yeah they'll talk, yeah they'll even sing

(Everybody now! Oh oh oh oh oh)

They come singing through the window, singing through the trees
Yeah they're singing through the bright spring leaves

(Everybody now! Oh oh oh oh oh)

Yeah they love you when they need you
But someday you're gonna need to
Find some other kind of place to go, oh

No...

Now you're standing in the kitchen, and you're pouring out my drink
Well there's a very obvious difference, and it's that one of us can think
If there's a bump in the road yeah you'd fix it,
But for me I'll just run off the road
But tonight you've got me cornered, and I haven't got a place to go

You never know where some people will go
Yeah some people been hurtin' me
You can tell by look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or the blink of an eye

Still into You,Paramore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paramore/stillintoyou.html,"Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies

Counting Stars,OneRepublic,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/onerepublic/countingstars.html,"Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive

And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

Every thing that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Never Forget You,Noisettes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/noisettes/neverforgetyou.html,"Watcha drinkin'?
Rum or whiskey?
Now won'tcha have a
Double with me?

I'm sorry I'm a little late
I got your message by the way
I'm calling in sick today
So let's go out for old time's sake

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

We were mischievous
And you were always wearing black
I was so serious
You know my boyfriend's mother nearly had a heart attack

I'm sorry I'm a little late
You know the stripes on a tiger are hard to change
I know this
World feels like an empty stage
I wouldn't change a thing
So glad you're back again

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

I'll never forget you
At times we couldn't shake it
You're my joy
Always remember me

We just got swallowed up
You know I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up
We just got swallowed up
And you know that I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up
By the whole damn world

Watcha thinkin'?
Did you miss me?
I borrowed your silver boots
Now if you'd just let me give them back to you,

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

I'll never forget you
Although at times we couldn't shake it
You're my joy

The sparks that fly from you to me

Where am I supposed to go?
I'm hoping that you won't say no
We've got all the time in the world.

It must be the chemistry, tonight
I hope you that know
I won't let you go this time

It must be the chemistry, between you and I
I hope that you know
I won't let you go this time

Underneath the starry sky,
You can bring me back to life.
I touch your skin, I feel alive
Been searching for you every night.

Take me somewhere I don't know,
Watch all the people then below,
We've got all the time in the world.

Get Together,The Youngbloods,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/youngbloods/gettogether.html,"Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Some may come and some may go
He will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

If you hear the song I sing
You will understand, listen
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

I said come on, people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Right now

I'm All Over It,Jamie Cullum,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiecullum/imalloverit.html,"Hello Innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing
How I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one
And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please

Let me go
Don't you know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I tried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

She's a melody
That I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me
When I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't fight
That song going round in my head
Like the last things you said

Please don't go
You think I know

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change but I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back

She left without a warning
And took the red-eye back to London town

A real rebel kinda fella
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a-hey!
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls though they try
It's if they just can't stay away

The Boys,Keane,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/keane/theboys.html,"The boys are grinning from the photograph
It's Friday night and they're trying so hard
The sun is dropping and they want to go
Driving into town to see some girls they know

The boys, blazing on a summer night
Girls they want to watch them ride
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember
Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember

We felt like fighters when we caught the plane
Until that day we'd never heard its name
We did some things we didn't understand
And now we feel like strangers in our own land

The boys, blazing on a summer night
Girls they want to watch them fight
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I can't remember
Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I can't remember

This photograph, I hold it when I sleep
Cause people soon stop asking
When I cannot explain what I have seen
And at the bars in town
All the boys in town
Are running all the good days down
Running all the good days down
Running all the good days down
All the good days down",2012

Three sixty-five days a year, twenty-four a day, seven days a week.

Whether night or day, non-stop you'll play, and you know you still want more.

Everybody in the club c'mon keep bobbin' your head now to this song.
You got the beats and breaks and your body shake, and we're doin' it all night long.

Headstart For Happiness,The Style Council,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stylecouncil/headstartforhappiness.html,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.",1983
Drive By,Train,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/train/driveby.html,"On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's dÃ©jÃ  vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west LA
Or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

Please believe
That when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve
But love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's dÃ©jÃ  vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

Someone Somewhere,Jason Reeves,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonreeves/someonesomewhere.html,"Someone is waiting 
Someone who understands 
Exactly how you feel

Off the ground 
Out of the blue

Is looking right back at you 

Maybe that someone's me 
Maybe it's meant to be 
Lovers 
Strangers 
Sometimes bombs fall quietly 

Maybe it's chemistry 
Maybe it's hard to see 
That someone is the right one 
Well I hope that someone is me 

Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
No one really knows the truth 
All we've got's a point of view 

There's too many questions 
There's too many questions 
And too many reasons not to try 
There's too many reasons not to try 

But you 
You take 
Your eyes off the ground 
Out of the blue 
And see that someone 
Is looking right back at you 

Maybe that someone's me

You can have it if you dare

It's the city of love that waits for you

Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight

Still you're tryna get it out your brain

It's the past that you're dying to change

While the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true

I stay awake for days
I stay awake for days
But I'd sit awake in daze anyway
I'm a maze of chains

Hey don't use the term accommodation
I won't be there for that and that will never be there for me

Dine behind a suitcase in an empty room

The tail the boys are chasing
When you get home you think I'll be the bigger man

I've been thinkin bout somethin
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you

I ignored your reputation
Cause you send my heart racing
You think I would always be the fool

Well I've run out of patience
For this sticky situation
You won't find me crying that we're through

I've been thinkin bout somethin
I've been thinkin bout somethin other you
It's sad to say, but baby everyday
I've been thinkin bout somethin
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you

Well if you're not too proud to beg
I can give you some respect
But the tune you hum is never gonna change

You didn't have to do what you did
But I thank you it ended like this
Cause the love I've got it better than what you gave

Well I've got girls in line
Waiting for these arms of mine
Listen up to what I say

I've been thinkin bout somethin
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you

I've been thinkin bout somethin

I've had enough of your tainted love you give me everyday
I tried to limit the loney nights
But I'm done getting played, c'mon c'mon yeah
I'm not gonna make that same mistake

Dog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and me
(Sound of a switchblade shining in the summer rain)
No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""

Dreaming again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes
(Chattering boys and a chicken at the chopping block)
All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)
Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""

Dreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbed
(Long dead rows of daffodils and marigolds)
Changing her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said,
(Blood on my chin, still chewing on a red rose)
""No one lives forever and the devil never sleeps alone""
Everybody bitching, ""There's nothing on the radio""",2007

It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle cause I'm so glad she found me.
Sometimes I wake up feeling crabby, she gives me love as sweet as candy.

It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, every time I see my little boy child.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, sometimes I even jump for joy, child.
He knows just how to make me happy, he gives me loves and calls me Daddy.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, c'mon giggle for me.

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall. It just blows me away to be part of it all.
It makes me giggle, it makes me giggle, just singing these love songs for you.
It makes me giggle, sometimes I wiggle, there ain't nothing that I'd rather do.
I like to see you with a smile on your face, I'd like to give one to the whole human race
and then I'd giggle, we could all giggle, now wiggle for me.

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall, it just blows me away to be part of it all.",1976

You gotta treat you right
You gotta give in to the crazy appetite
You gotta shake it up
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all of the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
Redefine what it is that really makes you happy
Get excited, let your world be a world that you build with a smile

You're beautiful and evergreen
You're dancing on high hopes and you got big dreams
So let them shine, we'll light it up
Cause now's the time to find your voice
Wear your heart out on your sleeve
Cause you know the best of things in life are free
And that's all you need

You gotta live your life
You gotta treat you right
You gotta give in to the crazy appetite
You gotta shake it up
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all of the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
Redefine what it is that really makes you happy
Get excited, let your world be a world that you build with a smile

So live for the nights we won't forget
Live for the memories we haven't made yet
Turn up the love, fall into it
Live for the memories we haven't made yet
This is our life, no regrets

You gotta live your life
You gotta treat you right
You gotta give in to the crazy appetite
You gotta shake it up
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all of the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
Redefine what it is that really makes you happy
Get excited, let your world be a world that you build with a smile",
Santa Maria da Feira,Devendra Banhart,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/devendrabanhart/santamariadafeira.html,"Pensando cada dÃ­a, cada hora
Pensando en ti
Caminando, mi cesta llena de moras
Son para ti
Temprano por la tarde y por la noche
SueÃ±o de ti

Lalalala

Comiendo pera
En santa marÃ­a de la feria
Que placer ir
La gente buena
Solo goza nunca hay pena
Pa' que sufrir
Jugando en el mar, en la arena
Viviendo asÃ­
Lalalala

Ventana blanca
Hay que venga la maÃ±ana
Hay que venga otra vez
Esperando
AsÃ­ es como yo paso mi tiempo
Esperando a Inaniel
Y rezando por su calor, por su aliento
Sobre mi piel

Te digo todo aquÃ­ va bien
Conmigo de no dormir
Amigo, te lo suplico, te lo pido
Que me ayudes a mi, a mi

Buscando
Con mi ancla en la marea
Nadando en ti
Yo voy andando
Ãyeme, te estoy llamando
Te amo a ti

Por el valle me encontrÃ© un rio escondido
Me ahoge ahi
Me recuerdo, hacÃ­a calor pero tenia frio
Me iba a morir

Bianca
Ay Paloma, ay Angelina
Por fin te vi
Por fin te vi
Por fin te vi",2005

Elephant Gun,Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/elephantgun.html,"If I was young, I'd flee this town
I'd bury my dreams underground
As did I, we drink to die, we drink tonight

Far from home, elephant guns
Let's take them down one by one
We'll lay it down, it's not been found, it's not around

Let the seasons begin - it rolls right on
Let the seasons begin - take the big king down

Let the seasons begin - it rolls right on
Let the seasons begin - take the big king down

And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the night

And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the silence, all that is left is all that I hide",P:  
Punk Rock Princess,Something Corporate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/somethingcorporate/punkrockprincess.html,"Maybe when the room is empty,
Maybe when the bottle's full.
Maybe when the door gets broke down, 
Love can break in.

Maybe when I'm done with thinking,
Maybe you can think me whole.
Maybe when I'm done with endings
This can begin, this can begin
This can begin.

If you could be my punk rock princess, 
I would be your garage band king.
You can tell me why you just don't fit in
And how you're gonna be something

Maybe when your hair gets darker,
Maybe when your eyes get wide,
Maybe when the walls are smaller
There will be more space

Maybe when I'm not so tired,
Maybe you could step inside
Maybe when I look for things that 
I cant replace, I cant replace
I cant replace.

If you could be my punk rock princess,
I would be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in,
And how you're gonna be something.

If I could be your first real heartache,
I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess,
I would be your heroine.

I never thought you'd last,
I never dream you would.
You watch your life go past,
You wonder if you should.

If you should be my punk rock princess,
So I could be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in,
And how you're gonna be something.

If I could be your first real heartache,
I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess,
I would be your heroine.

Everybody Loves Somebody,Dean Martin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deanmartin/everybodylovessomebody.html,"Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms

Every boy would find what I found in your arms

And jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear
Clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferry-boats
And they'll get high
On a bluer ocean
Against tomorrow's sky
And I will never grow so old again
And I will walk and talk
In gardens all wet with rain

Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
And I shall drive my chariot
Down your streets and cry
'Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite
And I don't know why'
And you shall take me strongly
In your arms again
And I will not remember
That I even felt the pain.
We shall walk and talk
In gardens all misty and wet with rain
And I will never, never, never
Grow so old again.

Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
And I will raise my hand up
Into the night time sky
And count the stars
That's shining in your eye
Just to dig it all an' not to wonder
That's just fine
And I'll be satisfied
Not to read in between the lines
And I will walk and talk
In gardens all wet with rain
And I will never, ever, ever, ever
Grow so old again.
Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
Sugar-baby with your champagne eyes
And your saint-like smile....",1968

When my godgiven little became a lot older
Goodbyes seal my broken heart
Hold on to your teardrops, you got a long way to go

Did you get older doing nothing today?
Don't you wanna stop complaining?
If one is easy then hard is two
No one knows where you're heading to
Once my private collection, always betting on you

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hairâyeah that's it!
If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you more

I thought about this for a long time
Never had the chance to try and make it better
My heart is waiting for a new you
And there's no other option on the schedule

Love like ours should never die with years
Once you start you can't ever go backwards
'Cause if dark is one then bright is two
No one knows where we're heading to
No matter what it takes, never give up on you

I want you to change it all
I am gonna make it better

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hairâyeah that's it!
If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you more

every minute i have needs to be made up
but how?
i'm looking for a nice way to say
""i'm out.""
i want out.

i fall asleep with my friends around me
only place i know, i feel safe
i'm gonna call this home

the open road is still miles away
Hey nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

Windows open and close
that's just how it goes

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

i'm in love with the ordinary
i need a simple space
and rest my head
everything gets clear
well i'm a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps 
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it (over it)

it might seem like a dream
but it's real to me

don't it feel like sunshine afterall
the world we love forever, gone
we're only just as happy
as everyone else seems to think we are

you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesn't seem theres hope for me
i let you down

Love Me Already,Black Kids,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackkids/lovemealready.html,"My girl's been a real whore
Spending her time with Theodore
Now Teddy, he's my best friend
But with friends like these
Who needs enemies?
My mother, she told me
""You're being silly
Talking, talking crazy""
Don't tell me what my problem is
Just tell me what she's doing at his
Apartment at midnight
I didn't get an invite
Tonight on my birthday
That ain't half-right
My best boy Teddy
That skeezer, how could he?
God-damn it, girl, just love me already!
Can't you love, love, love me already?

Love, love, love me already, baby
Love, love, love me already
Love, love, love me already, baby

My father, he told me
""Biting or begging
Love hurts your knees
You can't treat women like hotels
Why should she love you?
She knows you so well""
Now I'm at a payphone
Humming so slow
To her busy tones
Now I knock on Ted's door
Keeping time with my heartbeat
(Now he knocks on Ted's door
Keeping time with his heartbeat)
Now I knock on Ted's door
Keeping time with my heartbeat

The whore let's me in, and it looks like a party
Surprise! Surprise! It's your party, baby
I know you hate secrets but try not to hate me
Teddy and I, we kept it all on the sly
So baby, don't cry
And please won't you try
To love me already?
Love me already
So baby, don't cry
And please won't you try
So baby, don't cry
And please won't you try

To love, love, love me already?

Just love, love, love me already

Oslo In The Summertime,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/oslointhesummertime.html,"Oslo in the summertime; nobody can fall asleep, staring out the window from my bed.
At 4 A.M., the sun is up. Look, the sky is peppered with sea birds and with crows all cackling.

Up in treten Heimdalsgate, me and Nina making fun of footballers in Rudolf Nilsen Plass.
I practice my Norwegian on poor befuddled waitresses, who shake their heads completely at a loss.
Oslo in the summertime -- the streets are strangely quiet 'cause everyone's away on holiday.

Oslo in the summertime; Pakistani children play locked inside of the courtyard all day.
Pretty people everywhere, sun-lamp tans and flaxen hair -- just tell the American not to stare.",2005

I drowned my sorrows and slept around
When not in body at least in mind
We'll find a cathedral city
You can convince me I am pretty

We'll pick berries and recline
Let's hit the road dear friend of mine
Wave goodbye to our thankless jobs
We'll drive for miles maybe never turn off
We'll find a cathedral city you can be handsome I'll be pretty

What does this city have to offer me?
Everyone else thinks it's the bee's knees
What does this city have to offer me?
I just can't see
I just can't see

Let's get out of this country
I have been so unhappy
Smell the Jasmine my head was turned
I feel like getting confessional
We'll find a cathedral city you can convince me I am pretty

It seems a lot to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down
These things they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me

It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same, save the shame for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Baby's got some new rules
Baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey
And baby's got a baby with me

Brighter Than Sunshine,Aqualung,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aqualung/brighterthansunshine.html,"I never understood before.
I never knew what love was for.
My heart was broke, my head was sore -
What a feeling.

Tied up in ancient history,
I didn't believe in destiny.
I look up, you're standing next to me -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine,
Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine;
And it's brighter than sunshine.

I never saw it happening.
I'd given up and given in.
I just couldn't take the hurt again -
What a feeling.

I didn't have the strength to fight.
Suddenly, you seemed so right.
Me and you -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.

And it's brighter than the sun.
It's brighter than the sun.
It's brighter than the sun, sunshine.

Love will remain a mystery,
But give me your hand, and you will see.
Your heart is keeping time with me.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.

I got a feeling in my soul.
Love burns brighter than sunshine,
Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.

The Man Who Can't Be Moved,The Script,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/script/themanwhocantbemoved.html,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, ""If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?""

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go""

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
I'm not moving, I'm not moving

People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh, oh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
(Find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
(Oh, where on Earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
(To the place that we'd meet, oh, oh)
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
(On the corner of the street)

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
(So I'm not moving)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
(I'm not moving)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
(I'm not moving)
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
(I'm not moving)

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move",2008
Fake Empire,The National,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/national/fakeempire.html,"Stay out super late tonight picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city with our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Turn the light out say goodnight, no thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
We're half awake in a fake empire

We're half awake in a fake empire",2007

For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oooh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

Yea, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

Brandenburg,Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/brandenburg.html,"Send me now, the winter's over
A light turns out and we are older
The love we've had will turn all over
Going south and we are older

On the one time I told you also
On a night like this you all turn around
no but I, I won't have you anymore
no and I, I can't have you anymore

And some days we're all alone on the banks of the Rhine
And some days all we have was worth while
And some sing dreams of spears chosen once in life
And some days we're all alone on the banks of the Rhine",2006

You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here, watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all
Well, this time tomorrow what will we see
Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me

Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across any empty sea
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow",1970
Contact High,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/contacthigh.html,"(T-t-touch)
If one of these two walls could speak
I'd turn the lights down long enough to hit repeat
Right now my vision is gone and magic's to blame
It's silent down here, hey I want to get loud again
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with the love that's in the air

Contact high
I'm done dreamin that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

Four letter words won't hold any sway (uh uh)
And in a paradise that shakes the word romantic to the bone
Mystical forces are circling me, while perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Lost in the ether with no one to blame
It's silent down here, maybe I want to get loud again

Contact high
I'm done dreamin that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

(When we touch I get a)
Contact high
I'm done leaving if we can try
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with the love that's in the air

Needs some time alone, needs some time alone

To feel down
To feel down

After tonight, another day
A chance to feel a different way
The sun is slowly changing sides
Still, sorrow in your eyes
Sorrow in your eyes

So feel down

Heavy hearts swaying low
Feel down, let it go

Non cambi mai, non cambi mai, non cambi mai

Chiamami tormento dai, hai visto mai?

The Cave,Mumford & Sons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mumfordsons/thecave.html,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

âCause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

âCause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again",2009

Done with what we've lost

And when the gas runs out, just wreck it, you insured the thing

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in
I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in

But I can't sigh now that you made the move
It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star

It's getting ugly out
So tired, so tired, so tired
So take me home.
It's getting late for me
I'll come if you wait for me
Let's get out of this place
Never changes it just stays the same
Just take me home

C'mon let's go
I just wanna run away

Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone.

We don't have to worry
Bout anything at all until the dawn

Alcohol,Barenaked Ladies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barenakedladies/alcohol.html,"Alcohol, my permanent accessory
Alcohol, a party-time necessity
Alchool, alternative to feeling like yourself
O Alcohol, I still drink to your health

I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol

Forget the caffe latte,
screw the raspberry iced tea
A Malibu and Coke for you, a G&T for me
Alcohol, Your songs resolve like
my life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill

I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
O Alcohol, would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

I thought that Alcohol was just for those with
nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time
and there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
self-control and self-abuse

I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Would you please ignore that you
found me on the floor
Trying on your camisole?
O Alcohol, would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

Would you please forgive me?
Would you please forgive me?",1998
Loose Ends,Imogen Heap,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/imogenheap/looseends.html,"Doing everything by halves... got a real flare with excuses.
Meeting someone at the bar... where loose ends still have uses.

It's complicated... this time, I think it could be.
Triangulated, it could be just what we need...
So what you say... we give it up and walk away?
We're overrated, anyway.

We're kissing without kissing... got it down to a fine art.
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky; we grew up and wide apart.
Not now, not ever, no... it's never a good time.
How will the good times ever roll along?
Comparing photos then and now.
Just wondering...wondering...where it all went wrong.

It's complicated... this time, I think it could be.
Triangulated, it could be just what we need...
So what you say... we give it up and walk away?
Nothing to salvage, anyway.

Come on Petunia,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/comeonpetunia.html,"Every little thing she does is magic

And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Come on Petunia, you thought in your head
It would all be so easy if you could be led
To the cave where I'd hide you in linens and frames
And in new combinations I've made of our names
It's a tiny hole, yeah, but you'd fit
If I sliced you up real itty bitty
I'd sliver and splice you and then you'd be many
And I'd be the one who was privy to love you
And show you the fun

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Jamie, he stood on the stoop
And he challenged his homies
To go get some girlfriends
And locate their yonis
The waters are parting and time's getting heated
The boys needed friendship
Their beat needed meated (uh uh)
Her dress was a ship at sail (uh)
Her knees were the water pail
This was survival and she was the kit
You could die of thirst if the girls won't give you sips

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up
A thousand times a day
I thought I'd ask her if she'd marry me
In some old fashioned way
Well, but, my silent fears persisted
And before I reached the phone
Like before my tongue has twisted must I always be alone?

Mmm
You're all Jenny and Lyndsay and fine
And I'm underwater, I'm shedding my mind
And I'm pretty sure, baby, if you'd hold my head
I could live like I've wished for and undo my dread
Cause I see candygrams up in the ceiling tiles
Witty postcards sent off from the sandwich aisles
And these towns where vacations will lead us
I'll hold out my treasures and their welfare feed us
But oh she does what she wishes
And, no, she won't be your missus
The kingdom it widens and no, they're alone with all that love and the void on your throne

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
And even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on",2004

Free Man In Paris,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/freemaninparis.html,"The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es 
Going cafÃ© to cabaret
Thinking how I'd feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery
Behind the popular song",1974

Were not all bad
We put our feet just where they had, had to go

Following close but nearly twice as slow
In my good times
There were always golden rocks to throw
At those who, those who admit defeat too late
Those were our times, those were our times

And I will love to see that day
That day is mine
When she will marry me outside with the willow trees
And play the songs we made
They made me so
And I would love to see that day
That day was mine",2006

Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Falling down and nearing the rose beds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh you had it but oh no you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it

And you swimming up tide or just tuning in radio stations

I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in a field
That's okay, I was born in L.A.

And we're restating on this hill
That Jesus came from Israel
Isaac followed the sacred cow
So not to wake a sparrow splashing mud

But that was many years from now
And I hope from here on now
That I always seem to want to shout
Your eyes are like a cup of tea
You're sending to the sun with me

You swimming upstream or just tune into new sensations
I was broken, you were broken

I left my love in the room

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
Of ritual drumming although at first glance
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance

It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
They hang on emotions they bottle inside
They peck at the ground
And strut out of stride",1998

At whose blind word
So clear but so unheard

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time

To appear sad
With the same old decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Everyone's so intimately re-arranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Lost and loaded
Still the same old decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate
It's so fun to relate

It's the room the sun and the sky
The room the sun and the sky

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment",2006
Songs of Love,The Divine Comedy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/divinecomedy/songsoflove.html,"Pale, pubescent beasts
Roam through the streets
And coffee shops
Their prey gather in herds
Of stiff knee-length skirts
And white ankle socks
But while they search for a mate
My type hibernate
In bedrooms above
Composing their songs of love

Young, uniform minds
In uniform lines
And uniform ties
Run round with trousers on fire
And signs of desire
They cannot disguise
While I try to find words
As light as the birds
That circle above
To put in my songs of love

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you have time
Let the sun shine down from above
And fill you with songs of love
Take me

Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So let's sing while we still can
While the sun hangs high up above
Wonderful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love",1996

The Good Left Undone,Rise Against,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/riseagainst/thegoodleftundone.html,"In fields where nothing grew but weeds,
I found a flower at my feet,
Bending there in my direction,
I wrapped a hand around its stem,
I pulled until the roots gave in,
Finding there what I'd been missing,

But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

Inside my hands these petals browned,
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now.
I pushed my fingers through the earth,
Returned this flower to the dirt,
So it could live. I walked away now.

But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn.
There's a point we pass from which we can't return.
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm.

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long,
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.

All because of you...
All because of you...

All because of you,
I haven't slept in so long.
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean,
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down,
Inside these arms of yours.

All because of you,
I believe in angels.
Not the kind with wings,
No, not the kind with halos,
The kind that bring you home,
When home becomes a strange place.
I'll follow your voice,
All you have to do is shout it out.",2006
Just Another,Pete Yorn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peteyorn/justanother.html,"You and I,
weâre two of a kind,
I hate to say it but youâll never relate,
what makes you tick?
It makes me smile.
You said that I should get away from it all,
and bury my head in the sand if I want to,
I think youâ¦
should thank me now.
You were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,
and I could never see you depart us
and youâre my baby,
youâre just another girl.
I never mind the way I had to see ya,
my working on a day show never explains why I see you
and I feel your pain.
I love to wear my work inside of my head,
I canât complain but you should never react the way you did,
I feel your time.
You were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,
and I could never see you depart us
and youâre my babyâ¦
And you were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,

'Cello Song,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/cellosong.html,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.",1969
Man in a Shed,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/maninashed.html,"Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.",1969
Road to Somewhere,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/roadtosomewhere.html,"Walking down the Mercer St
Been a long hot summer
Rain like daggers coming
Down on me
Get a feeling it's too late
But alone, together, could
Be we might start it up
Allover again

Dream, dream you're not 
Too late
Sweet road to somewhere else

Listen to the radio
Are you calling?

3 o'clock I'm on my way
On the road to somewhere
Little clouds like wounds
That blow away
Listening to the radio like a
Friend that guides me
Playing out every song
We used to know

Dream, dream you're not 
Too late
Sweet road to somewhere else

Come along
On the road to somewhere
Take our time
See the signs

The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes

I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape

Happiness Is Easy,Talk Talk,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/talktalk/happinessiseasy.html,"Makes you feel much older
Sublime the blind parade
It wrecks me how they justify their acts
Of war, they assemble, they pray
Take good care of what the priests say
'After death it's so much fun'
Little sheep, don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy
(Joy be written on the Earth)
(And the sky above)
(Jesus, star that shines so bright)
(Gather us in love)

Guilt upon their shoulders
How well the cause evades
Infecting your religions, claiming pacts
It's easy to shoulder the blame

Happiness is easy
(Little ships of Galilee)
Happiness is easy
(Standing on the sea)
Happiness is easy
(Jesus tried to love us all)
Happiness is easy
(Be a friend to me)

Try to teach my children
To recognize excuse before it acts
From love & conviction to pray
Take good care of what the priests say
'After death it's so much fun'
Little sheep, don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy
(Little ships of Galilee)
(Standing on the sea)
(Jesus tried to love us all)
(Be a friend to me)
(Little ships of Galilee)

Coffee & TV,Blur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blur/coffeetv.html,"Do you feel like a chain store?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So give me Coffee and TV
Peacefully
I've seen so much
I'm goin' blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Do you go to the country
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
'Cause of who you are

Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there you're sure
'Til the words start slurring
And you can't find the door

So give me Coffee and TV
Peacefully
I've seen so much
I'm goin' blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

So give me Coffee and TV

I'm goin' blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually

Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game

Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

This is my religion",1998

Scarlet Begonias,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/scarletbegonias.html,"As I was walking down rubadub square
Not a chill to the weather but a nip to the air
From another direction she was caught in my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try
..might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls

Well I ain't never been right as I ain't never been wrong
As everything works out the way it does in this song
'Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[rap] It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above
Because the women took the lovin' over me
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
Because I sold off my personal property
A tight tie-dyed dress, she was a psychedelic mess
We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea,
We sold some ecstasy,
We sold nitrus, opium, acid, heroin and PCP
Now I hear the police coming after me
Yes, now I hear the police coming after me
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair,
She's got the police coming after me

Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues
And there ain't nothin wrong with the love that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by.
let her pass by.

Then we could float out into the water

We'll drop a line down into the blue sea
You'll close your eyes just like you always wanted
I'll catch a fish bigger than you and me
Now I'm a fisherman just like I always wanted

And be still
Ain't this a nice view of the city?
All those people way up there
They don't know what they're missing

We'll catch a current down to the river mouth
We'll paddle hard, yeah we are gonna make it this time
We'll fuck the flow right up into the lake
Where we could drink, sunburn, jump in

We'll sink the boat, float upon our body fat

I'm sinking fast, I'm sinking fast, I need salt

If your offered hand is still open to me

From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk

All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

It all seems meaningless
I wish that I could step away and breathe

Clear away the clouds inside my head

That itâs ok now
What are you worrying about

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When thereâs so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy

People lie, people hide, people cry, people fight

And they donât know why
If fear is all that we should fear
Then what are we so afraid of
'Cause fear is only in our heads

Someone please say...

Everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
During my stressing Iâm blinded to the lessons 
That could be a blessing if Id be confessing that the enemy
Iâm trying to beat is hiding inside of me

Wait for the morning light
To shine in through

Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you

Dispatch the Troops,Matisyahu,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/dispatchthetroops.html,"Daughter of Zion
Once precious princess
Left her father's house
To walk the streets that never rest
Maybe they'll hear me in the metropolis
So I'm sending out and SOS
Fighting with her ""ta""
She wants out of this mess
And those big city lights
Might brighten up the darkness
You know that I'm tired and you know that I'm stressed
You can't stop me and you can't stop this
You could call the police try to make an arrest
Today is the day that repossess
Leaving on the first bus that I can get
Now its rings around the eyes sopping wet from rain droplets
Window shopping for some solace
No address and penniless
Thats the price you pay from running away from the stress
Feeling the pain likes the dance by the DJ
Reminds me of a time when things were OK
Frightened by her own shadow
Now she wants to go home
Many names for one God
Trotting on through the facade
You were all my children
Got a dig for that feeling
Love will break through the concealment
Strip away the serpents skin
We came to win
Dispatch the troops
Send out the captain
My gem is held captive in the dungeon
Don't come back again until you end the mission
If it takes a long time
Don't lose the vision
If you're stuck
Check the blueprint
Look within
Reflection
Got to find the rhythm
Won't you please return child
Where you been?
She says I can't come home because he won't let me in
And besides we don't need no more friction
Used to look so nice how'd you get so thin?
With a heart of ice it's a heart of sin
Skin white like a ghost with a pale complexion
Pray to God for the dead we need resurrection
Don't you know wherever you go thick and thin
You are still my children
Since you've been gone my soul's been hearting
Wondering through this world

What I'm Trying To Say,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/whatimtryingtosay.html,"You look so good in the clothes of a poser
And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Let me take you there

North of the river all the streets are the same
We can pretend that they don't know our name
And the heat is turned all the way to full
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
I really knew you

We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

Springs comes in when I'm rolling up another one
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens and a beer...
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens and a beer...

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""

I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
""I love you""",2004
Only Heather,Wild Nothing,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildnothing/onlyheather.html,"Dressed in the moonlight and paler than bone
She has got something that I've never known
I couldn't explain it I won't even try
She is so lovely she makes me feel high

Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Can make me feel this way

Misunderstood she's good I can tell
Though everyone tells me I'm under her spell
But I'll never leave her they don't know our deal
Its better to fake than to love her for real

Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Can make me feel this way",2012
You Might Have Noticed,The Academy Is...,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/academyis/youmighthavenoticed.html,"If you're under the impression I'm alright.
I guess you never noticed.
I guess you might have known
I've been holding this together for so long.
But I guess you might have noticed.
Well I guess you...

The beast within the burden is all mine
A product of his father, a slave to his pride.
I feel I need to reveal my true stripes,
But the bitch of all this trouble here
Waits behind the wind to find out.

You set me up to leave me,
You wanted to feel,
Shallow love, shallow lives.
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me.
Wanted from me... Yeah

I'm sinking more and more into my lies.
Now home is just a pinprick in the vastness of my life.
Feel the pressure, feel the pleasure,
Feel the pain, you're not alone.

Feel the pain.

You wanted to feel,
Shallow love, shallow lives.

In moderation, what was once us now never was.

Disappear,INXS,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/inxs/disappear.html,"Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on T.V
Pain and suffering
And the struggle to be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say your mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Say if I could
Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings

Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realise all that I am
You put the light inside this man

You're so fine
Lose my mind

Do You Believe In Magic,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?",1965

That no one is afraid of themselves

Out of your happy-go-lucky fields
Of such polluted thinking

Work through the rockets my fathers
Work through the rockets my fathers

Where are the dreams of the baby's going?
Coz you know there all going so fast  
Take, take as much as you can
Cuz you know its going so fast
But you know it's so good
Where are the men that mountain so brave
That they do not explode over everyone

Pick, pick up dig, dig out those weeds
Out of your happy-go-lucky field of such polluted thinking

Work through the rockets my fathers

Work through the rockets, my fathers

There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear it coming
I could hear the sirens sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on
Time'll leak and lead you on
Still it's such beautiful night

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground",2008

The Tuning Of Violins,Darren Hayes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/darrenhayes/thetuningofviolins.html,"Daylight breaks, and the black birds call-
And the market stalls are all filling up, spilling over the streets.
High above, over Notting Hill-
I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

[Chorus:]
On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh-
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends-
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

[Chorus x2]

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.
Yeah we will unravel, unravel the moments.

Oh...

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will come to your window.

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
On a Sunday only we know,
I'll be calling your name as I float through your window.",2007
Happiness,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/happiness.html,"Activity's killing the actor
And the cop's standing out in the road
Turning traffic away
There was nothing she could do until after
When his body'd been buried below
Way back in the day
Oh my, nothing else could have been done
He made his life a lie so
He might never have to know anyone
Made his life a lie you know
I told him that he shouldn't upset her
And that he'd only be making it worse
Involving somebody else
But I knew that he'd never forget her
While her memory worked in reverse
To keep her safe from herself
And oh my, nothing else could have been done
She made her life a lie so
She might never have to know anyone
Made her life a lie you know
What I used to be will pass away and then you'll see
That all I want now is happiness for you and me
What I used to be will pass away and then you'll see
That all I want now is happiness for you and me

But what you said was something
that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not

Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters

But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
I suppose that we all could say
that nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
to see everything in tatters",2000
Meet You There,Augustana,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/augustana/meetyouthere.html,"Climb up on a mountain, just to watch it come down
But sooner or later babe, you're gonna need me around
'Cause you're getting older, there ain't no stopping that
It's a backstabbing world honey, just lean your head back

[Chorus:]
The fool in me
It's like a dream, you see
But if the world is right
I'll drive all night
And meet you there someday

Six in the morning, never felt so sweet
Just put on Lucinda baby, and dance with me
I know I'm hard to count on
Forget half what I'm told
You probably only know my voice from
A goddam microphone

[Chorus]

It's a waste
A teenage taste of me
But if Daddy cries
Just say goodnight
And I'll come
If I could change
I'd keep away the rain
And the sun would shine every night
And I'll come meet you there someday...

[Chorus]

Meet you there someday
Meet you there someday
Meet you there someday",2008
The Space Between,Valencia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/valencia/thespacebetween.html,"There's something strange going on in my head
That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing, so stare up at the clouds
And at least you know you're always looking up

So Casey can you remember (Do you remember)
Sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
And talking about life

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we'd stay inside just to watch the time go by
And sleep the whole day till the night
With everything you said
I'm sure you've got some place that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song and thinking about me

Carolina was waiting for you
It's what you always wanted

Don't forget about the blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away
Cause the sky looks different when you're in another state
It's everything I've always wanted
And everything I've worked so hard for

Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?
Well is it in me
To put the bottle down?

Well is it in me
(Blue sky, sunrise, and all the space between)
To put the bottle down?
(It's amazing how a girl like you can affect a guy like me)
Well is it in me
(And all the pictures, memories and all the times we had)
To put the bottle down?
(Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?)

Is it in me?
Is it in me?",2005
I'd Tell You But...,Anti-Flag,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antiflag/idtellyoubut.html,"Your invasion was a crime
Your righteous explanations - lies
Kicking in our doors, raids at night
Won't win you hearts, you've lost your minds.
Your killing of my family
Did not make a fan out of me
If this is what your freedom reaps
Keep it for your United States. 
I'd tell you all these things but I can't speak because...

I'm dead, I'm dead
my life is life no more
I'm dead, I'm dead
your bullets cut into my flesh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

I love to read, write poetry
I love my friends, my family
I love the sand and love the sea
The water splashing over me
Now I will haunt you in your dreams
Never another restful sleep
I'll forever be by your side. 
In life you're victim, death your bride.
My memory will haunt you when you're awake or asleep because...

I'm dead, I'm dead
my life is life no more
I'm dead, I'm dead

Hymn For the Dead,Anti-Flag,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/antiflag/hymnforthedead.html,"Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life
we are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!

The sun sets, the light fades
The blood red on an empty street
It's not night, it's not day
It's no more, for an unfortunate soul who
Witnessed his life violently erased, 
From the horror of the human race
Bright futures exchanged for profit, living half alive

Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life
we are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!

In life now pay respects to your blood
Those in the vast of the great
Unknown, unite there, your heart's one 
in moments you'll never forget, yeah
History lessons direct from the grave
Lost souls of the lost divide
Liberate your generation, living, rotting flesh

Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life
we are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors

Call out tyranny!
A spark of dissent can light a fury of flame
Call out to be free!

Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make

Strip away! Be the voice of a generation
Strip away! You've got a choice to make
Cut away! Cut away!
Strip away! Strip away!
Cut away! Strip away your chains!

Caught In The Rain,October Fall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/octoberfall/caughtintherain.html,"It's a heart break, that you can't fix up
It's a last try, when you've lost your luck
It's a bad day, another bad day.
It's a last chance, when they've given up
It's a bad ride, falling out of love
Can you take it?
'cause I can't take it...

It's starting up and never stopping again

When the rain starts shaking the ground
I hope that you're ready now.
I hope you're ready for it when you
Get caught out in the rain. I hope you're ready now
For all the storms to head your way

It's a long drive, when you've got no gas
It's a cheap date, when you're out of cash
It's a bad day, another bad day
It's a feeling, when you've lost your touch
It's a plane ride, if on the right drugs
And can you take it?
Honestly, I can't take it...

It's starting up and never stopping again

When the rain starts shaking the ground
I hope that you're ready now
I hope that you're ready for it when you
Get caught out in the rain. I hope you're ready now
For all the storms to come your way

We'll find ourselves inside the raindrops
We'll fight the seconds inside every clock
What's keeping you from leaving?
The newspapers are reading
Get out save yourself before we're burning in hell
When sun is what you're chasing
But everyday is raining
Pockets full of silver dimes
I hope you're ready for this time...",2006
All Good People,Nerina Pallot,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nerinapallot/allgoodpeople.html,"Hey was there something that you wanted to say?
I don't know what to do when you look that way,
Cigarettes and tequila at 6,
And the sung oing down on our life as it is,
In the blue light oh, your face, it looks...so...pale,
In the blue light, I can tell what you're going to say.

But all good people have a sense of themselves,
They never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,
And all good people the world is ok,
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

I heard that story, how you never went back,
What your mouth will not say, your eyes do for you...
A paper flower, and her pill in your drawer,
And her ghost at the bar drinks tequila too,
In the blue light, could we put this one to bed?
In the blue light, will you think of me instead?

'Cause all good people have a sense of themselves,
They never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,
And all good people know the world is ok,
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

Interior Of A Dutch House,Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/interiorofadutchhouse.html,"Could you really be so tired and you thought it was
Wave it down inside
Could you really be so tired and you thought you were
Wave it down inside
Could you really be so tired when you thought about it
Tie it all alone
Oh let me tell me violently turn around
When you don't die
Although it's if a lie when you told them
All in all you'll die

la la la la la la la

I wanna say you're right and now I'll fall
You're waiting all the time
Could rather sigh you're welcome 
All your time your time and say for
I wanna say your you're right and now you'll fall
You're right and now they are all
Then when it's solved
They're right and I will die
You held them all for your lie

Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derriÃ¨re
And you can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with you
I don't gotta talk about it baby you can see it
But if you want I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very

Cameras flashing, daddy turned his head just as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?

Get yourself together, don't hate (never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)

I know you're keeping to your own sound

Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one
And the world went on but I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

I can feel it coming so clear 
I can feel you already there
And I can see you with my eyes shut 
you're running in my head and I can't keep up
Said you'll be waiting for the next one 
but I always knew, I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

Our love was long so long 
and then forgotten like an old song

No mad, mad world and no mad hatters.
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters
In coconut grove.

Don't bar the door
There's no one comin'.
The ocean's roar will dull the drummin'
of any city thoughts or city ways.
The ocean breezes cool my mind,
The salty days are her's and mine
Just to do what we wanna.

Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly we will see the stars
Until sun up.

It's really true how nothin' matters.
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters.
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters

Somewhere Around Here,Chairlift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chairlift/somewherearoundhere.html,"Near the east Waverly Hills, your hair pinned back
In previous lives, we were frozen sticks
But these aren't so rigid
I throw off my coat to feel this January air

They wrote a book for the two of us
To read our books on
The darkest light before a darker night
We slip underwater
The bridge disappears, the deer hunt is in the frigid air

Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here

Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house
Nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl (another girl)

I went to see a fortune teller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard

I could be reeling them in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say

Then why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
The sound's off but the TV's on

Streets of Nowhere,Lostprophets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lostprophets/streetsofnowhere.html,"She won't let me go,
Don't put me down,

Big city lies,
The bullshit smiles,
The inside jokes and the changing style.

But when I'm here,
I leave behind,
What I don't need
'Cause everytime I walk these streets I know they're mine.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,
And I say, ""Lalalaa lalalaala, Lalalaa lalalaala la,

These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Grey clouds up above,
But you still gotta love,
These streets of nowhere,
These streets of nowhere.

Your faded signs,
Your tiny crime,
Your endless jokes that go on for miles

Your errant daughter,
Walks on water,
You wouldn't have a word said against her.

But I agree,
The factories,
The shopping carts sing a symphony,
That sounds like home to me.

It's just another day,
Living here this way,
Nothing ever troubles me,

Focusing on things that will make my feelings go up
Want me to share
My secret to happiness?

And I tell my mom I love her

The happy feelings that follow me
Are so cute that I'm happy

I feel bad for the adults
Who only chase after that
They are truly unhappy
The world is filled with
Happy things and great things
That it's been a while since we stopped caring about
Money and power

I'm a little different
I just do what I want to do
If you just worry and become an adult
You'll have regrets

I met my friend on my way to school
I'm happy that she ran over to me
And linked her arm in mine with a smile
The groups of boys who are always joking around
I'm happy that they pay attention
When I pass them

She may nag
But my mom says she loves me the most in this world
Hey hey, take out
Those adults who only fight on TV

I like it more and more
I'm happy that I'm me
What makes me even happier
Is that you're next to me

Uncatena,Sylvan Esso,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sylvanesso/uncatena.html,"I'm washing with all my friends in the kitchen
Drying dishes turning twisting until we can run out go swimming
I feel you behind me ringing bowls right next to my ears
Toe was so clear so that we all could hear when the water washed around us
Salty holding us steer

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

Skinny skinny skinny man with a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast to be swallowed let it last

I'm swimming with all my slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting
Limbs clenched so hard, mouth so resistant

Did you ever say oh no
Did you ever say no,

All I want from you is a letter and to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time",2014

Everyday thereâs another new line

Youâre looking thinner are you alright
Yeah I'm just busy all of the time
Iâm just a little more tired
Every day I really don't know why

Thereâs really nothing like the first time
Thereâs really nothing like the first time
Itâs a long way down when you fall
And youâre missing cloud nine

I wish I was more afraid
I made all the same mistakes they told me Iâd make
And now itâs different everyday
They make me, they break me

Iâm just so far, I feel so far away
Iâm just so far, I feel so far away
Iâm just so far, I feel so far away

Strange Encounter,Father John Misty,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fatherjohnmisty/strangeencounter.html,"Only ever be the girl who just almost died in my house
Half naked, looking through your telephone
Run you a bath and try hard not to freak out

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

Wanna find somebody
Not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Little aimless

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Humming,Turnover,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/turnover/humming.html,"Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young.
Positively unattached, 
Naive and unattracted to the buzz.
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song.
Show me why you're always smiling.
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space.
Drawn outside the lines,
your words, a vibrant illustration you create.

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole,
Deep down into an old slope.
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go,
Spinning out of control

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.

With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.",2015
She Bangs the Drums,The Stone Roses,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stoneroses/shebangsthedrums.html,"I can feel the earth begin to move
I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
The past was yours
But the future's mine
You're all out of time

I don't feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion fruit and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her here she comes

She bangs the drums

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words

The Magic Number,De La Soul,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delasoul/themagicnumber.html,"(Got to have soul!) 

[POS:]
3 
That's the Magic Number 
Yes it is 
It's the magic number 
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community 
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me 
And that's the magic number 

(What does it all mean?) 

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
Measure in my music, raised in three parts 
Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky 
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires 
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet 
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

Everybody wants to be a deejay 
Everybody wants to be an emcee 
But being speakers are the best 
And you don't have to guess 
De La Soul posse consists of three 
And that's the magic number 

[DOVE:]
This here piece of the pie 
Is not dessert but the course that we dine 
And three out of every darn time 
The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind 
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
When that negative number fills up the casualty 
Maybe you can subtract it 
You can call it your lucky partner 
Maybe you can call it your adjective 
But odd as it may be 
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
My 3 
Mase Pos and Me 
And that's the Magic Number 

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
Time is a factor so it's time to count 
Count not the negative actions of one 
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 

Now you may try to subtract it 
But it just won't go away 
Three times one? 
(What is it?) 
(One, two, three!) 
And that's the Magic Number 

(Yo, what's up?) 
(1, 2, 3) 
(I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
(I wouldn't lie to you) 
(No more no less, that's the magic number) 
(No more no less) 
(What it is?) 
(No more no less) 
(Is this the future?) 
(No more no less) 
(Do the shang-a-lang) 
(No more no less) 
(No one on the subway ever chats to me) 
(No more no less) 
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(Three feet high and rising) 
(No more no less) 
(Three) 
(That's the magic number)",1989

Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong

You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said show me around this alphabet town
Said show me around
There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it
And just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town

Rose Parade,Elliott Smith,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elliottsmith/roseparade.html,"They asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
Traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
'Cos he's fucking up even the simplest lines
They say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the streets I'll be the only shit that's left behind

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?",1997
Rainbowarriors,CocoRosie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cocorosie/rainbowarriors.html,"Of all the white horses

In these times of evil spirits
Of material thugs and mischief
Fearing Saint Noni's wisdom
And his love for rainbow spirits
Jealous of their faithful heart-bond
And their dancing and their laughing
Made at last a league against them
To molest them and destroy them
Saint Noni wise and heart-strong
Often said to Rainbowarrior
""O my brother, do not leave me!
Lest the evil spirits harm you!""
Rainbowarrior of two spirits
Gentle hand and lion-hearted
He laughed and then he answered
Like a child he softly whispered:

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears

He's dead, our sweetest mother
Loving father and our teacher
He's gone forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the master of all laughter
To the master of all song
O my brother, O my brother
Crystal brother of two spirits
Then we gathered in a circle
Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning ember's hearts united
We remember mystical beauty
If you look hard you can find a
Rainbow trail it's deep inside ya
Fear not you're a Rainbowarrior
Golden light on everything gleaming

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears",2007

Never pretend the chill
Too many shadows, too many sails

How can you really feel?
Two of another, none of a pair
Nobody move, nobody move

Days with the light off, freezing

Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
to a cat named Frankenstein

Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh)

It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money

Saying that everything's alright

Let this go, let this go

But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you

But now I feel like I don't know you

And I'll never let this go

Heart Attack,Sum 41,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sum41/heartattack.html,"Remember when there was nothing else to do,
But lie in bed
And wonder how it was always up to you
And no one else.
And early mornings,
Made by warnings,
What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining,
I'm not complaining,
But waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay.
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day,
And we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say,
'Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring,
Slept in mornings,
Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming.
It's not important
If days are shortened.
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do.

So, turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day.
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.

What's a day
When it all ends up the same
And lasts forever?
Can't complain
When there's nothing there to blame,
And things can't be better.

Summer evenings,
Teenage grievings,
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration
On hesitation,
I can't make time when nothing's new,
'Cause waking up is hard to do

So, turn my head it's back to bed with no delay,
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day,
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two.
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do.",2001
The Times They Are A-Changin',The Byrds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/byrds/thetimestheyareachangin.html,"Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.",1965

You've done neurotic paranoia, are you having fun?

You ain't going nowhere

Focusing in; details a must
Trying to make each one count
All on your fingers stopping at ten

Amateur Hour goes on and on
When you turn pro you know
She tells you so

Girls grow tops to go topless in
While we sit and count the hairs that blossom from our chins
Our voices change at a rapid pace
I could start a song a tenor and then end as bass

Choose your partners everyone
If you hesitate, the good ones are gone

But those cannot replace what is the real thing
It's a lot like playing the violin
You cannot start off to be Yehudi Menuhin

Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits

It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits for the last time

The clock never stops, never stops, never waits
She's growing old
It's getting late
And so he forgot, he forgot
Maybe not
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
Would that be worse?

Headlights crest the hill
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
Annie sees her dreams:
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park

Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time

Annie says ""You see this is why I'd rather be alone.""

And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits as the last...

Headlights crest the hill
Who will be the one for evermore?

Annie, I could be
If we're both still lonely when we're old

Just the same as the last time
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time

Annie waits

In love like a fool
I was tired of living the life of a fool
I was wondering where I'd gone wrong

It's gonna work out fine
But I know it's gonna work out fine, when I see that look in your eyes

I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now! (no no, no no)

I've heard some people say
Yeah, nothing can stop us now
I've heard people say that a man who needs a woman is weak
So wrong, oh so wrong
But they're so wrong, because nobody can hide from love
Do, do you want to know?
Do you want to know, do you want to know something else that's true?
It's true, it's true, the touch of your hand, oh
Just the touch of your hand, and I know we can make it

With fifty men

Declared a war
And killed some more
And killed some more again

with fate as malleable as clay;
but ships are fallible, I say,
and the nautical, like all things, fades.

And I can recall our caravel:
a little wicker beetle shell
with four fine masts and lateen sails,
its bearings on Cair Paravel.

O my love,
O it was a funny little thing
to be the ones to've seen.

The sight of bridges and balloons
makes calm canaries irritable;
and they caw and claw all afternoon:
""Catenaries and dirigibles
brace and buoy the living-room â
a loom of metals, warp-woof-wimble.""
And a thimblesworth of milky moon
can touch hearts larger than a thimble.

O it was a funny little thing

About making lots of money and such
And I always seemed to land upon my feet
And though there's been some difficult times
The good times were never far behind
I snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat

When I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life
My charmed life
I hope, dear
Baby, I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life
A charmed life

Well, the course of true love never ran smooth
They broke my heart, and I broke theirs, too
And breaking up was so very hard to do
But I knew I'd find the one
And sure enough, she came along
And not long after that, along came you

Well, sometimes this life is like being afloat
On a raging sea in a little rowboat
Just trying not to be washed overboard
But if you take your chances and you ride your luck
And you never, never, never, never, never give up
Well, those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore

When I hold you in my arms
I know that this is a charmed life

The Trapeze Swinger,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/thetrapezeswinger.html,"Please remember me, happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the Pearly Gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their great handshakes
But always done in such a hurry

And please remember me, at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white, by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Call, then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour

Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the Holy Kingdom
With words like, 'Lost and found' and 'Don't look down'
And 'Someone save temptation'

And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies

That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above there running

In circles round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright on cinder gray in spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'

And please remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful

But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the Pearly Gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing

Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissin' on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swinger

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah",2009

respectful fame with many medals
of bravery and stripes to his name
he grew a beard as soon as he could
to cover the scars on his face

but on the eve of a great battle
with the infantry in dream
the old general tossed in his sleep
and wrestled with its meaning
he awoke from the night
just to tell what he had seen
and walked slowly out of his tent

all the men held tall with their
chests in the air, with courage in
their blood and a fire in their stare
it was a grey morning and they all
wondered how they would fare
till the old general told them to go home

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

but the men stood fast with their
guns on their shoulders not knowing
what to do with the contradicting orders
the general said he would do his own
duty but would extend it no further
the men could go as they pleased

but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
till one by one
they stepped back and not a word was said
and the old general was left with his
own words echoing in his head
he then prepared to fight

He said: I have seen the others
and I have discovered
that this fight is not worth fighting, no
and I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going

So, take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
Take a shower, shine your shoes
you got no time to lose
you are young men you must be living
go now you are forgiven

go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven, go

go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven, go

go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven
go now you are forgiven

Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night,The Fratellis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fratellis/everybodyknowsyoucriedlastnight.html,"Whistle for the boys now don't be shy 
Give us all a song and a reason why 
Baby got the bones and a hand me down 
Says her heart is black but her eyes are brown

Give the girl some cash cause your mother said so 
And take em out to look at the queen 
And any old girl who's in between 

Lay yourself down by the side of the bed 
Oh you naughty girl you know you tickle me red 
You look so dumb and you sound so twee 
And you can only wish that you was married to me

Oh don't get upset 
Ridiculous you 
Waiting in the queue oh whoopee doo 
You could have been 
The best that I've seen 
Under the red light 
Everybody knows you cried last night 

Give us all a go till your face turns red 
Little Greg said you went home instead 
If you stick around you'll get an alibi 
And we'll try and keep your pretty face bone dry 
Rent a honey rent a honey one two three 
Chasing all the boys from your door cant be easy 
Well ruby said you was wrecked 
But your was never well behaved the last time I checked

The Mayor Of Simpleton,XTC,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xtc/themayorofsimpleton.html,"Never been near a university, 
Never took a paper or a learned degree, 
And some of your friends think that's stupid of me, 
But it's nothing that I care about. 

Well I don't know how to tell the weight of the sun, 
And of mathematics well I want none, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, 
But I know one thing, 
And that's I love you. 
When their logic grows cold and all thinking gets done, 
You'll be warm in the arms of the Mayor of Simpleton. 

I can't have been there when brains were handed round 
(please be upstanding for the Mayor of Simpleton), 
Or get past the cover of your books profound, 
(please be upstanding for the Mayor of Simpleton), 
And some of your friends thinks it's really unsound, 
That you're ever seen talking to me. 

Well I don't know how to write a big hit song, 
And all crossword puzzles well I just shun, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, 
But I know one thing, 
And that's I love you. 

I'm not proud of the fact that I never learned much, 
Just feel I should say, 
what you get is all real, 
I can't put on an act, 
It takes brains to do that anyway. (And anyway...) 

And I can't unravel riddles, problems and puns, 
How the home computer has me on the run, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, 
But I know one thing, 
And that's I love you (I love you). 

If depth of feeling is a currency, 
(please be upstanding for the Mayor of Simpleton), 
Then I'm the man who grew the money tree, 
(no Chain of Office and no hope of getting one). 
Some of your friends are too brainy to see, 
That they're paupers and that's how they'll stay. 

Well I don't know how many pounds make up a ton, 
Of all the Nobel prizes that I've never won, 
And I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, 
But I know one thing, 
And that's I love you. 

When all logic grows cold and all thinking gets done, 
You'll be warm in the arms of the Mayor of Simpleton. 
You'll be warm in the arms of the Mayor of Simpleton. 
You'll be warm in the arms of the Mayor.

I want a woman with the same brown eyes.

And girl, you got it so bad
when the only boy you know is your dad.
And boy, you got it so wrong

She tried to take me to the movies,

I didn't even let her sneak a touch.

She asked me ""Whats the problem,

Why Georgia,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/whygeorgia.html,"I am driving up 85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

If I am living it right
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, tell me why
Why, why Georgia, why?",2001

How did you know?
It's what I always wanted
Could never have had too many of these

Can we settle down please?

Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music?
Better quick sharp remove it
Pour me another
Oh, don't wag your finger at me

Meet Virginia,Train,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/train/meetvirginia.html,"She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day
You wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that hey
She thinks I'm beautiful

Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't it beautiful

Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna be the queen.""

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the president

And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the president

Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna live this life.""

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite unusual

You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body unusual

Meet Virginia
I can't wait to
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the queen
And she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams,

An Old Fashioned Love Song,Three Dog Night,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/threedognight/anoldfashionedlovesong.html,"Just an old-fashioned love song 
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music 
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony

To weave our dreams upon and listen 
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings 
That we've come to know
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song

Just an old song, comin' down

One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old song, comin' down

One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

Life Is Sweet,Natalie Merchant,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nataliemerchant/lifeissweet.html,"It's a pity
It's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again? 
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside 

It's a pity
It's a downright crime
But it happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
Wanna hide from the vicious world outside 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

Your daddy he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied, 
And you know
That's not right 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 
It's high time that you decide
In your own mind 

Tried to comfort you
Tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind
They can't see 

Fortune gonna come some day
All gonna fade away
Your daddy the war machine and
Your mama the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she can not see 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 

It's high time you decide
It's time you make up your own sweet little mind 

They told you life is long
Be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more
You should be grateful 

But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know
It will be over 

Cause life is sweet
And life is also very short
Your life is sweet",1998
No Other Way,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/nootherway.html,"When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break

All the words that we said
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake
Now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep,
It's all that we need
When we wake we would find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew all the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
'Cause we told each other, there is no other way",2005

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's alright
It's alright",
Feel Like Makin' Love,Roberta Flack,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertaflack/feellikemakinlove.html,"Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you're touchin' me
And my feelin's start to show

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

In a restaurant
holdin' hands by candlelight
While I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you",1975
