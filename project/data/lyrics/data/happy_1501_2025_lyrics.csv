Don't Dream It's Over,Sixpence None the Richer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sixpencenonethericher/dontdreamitsover.html,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over ...",2002
This Side,Nickel Creek,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelcreek/thisside.html,"One day you'll see her and you'll know what I mean.
Take her or leave her she will still be the same.
She'll not try to buy you with her time.
But nothing's the same, as you will see when she's gone.

It's foreign on this side,
And I'll not leave my home again.
There's no place to hide
And I'm nothing but scared.

You dream of colors that have never been made,
You imagine songs that have never been played.
They will try to buy you and your mind.
Only the curious have something to find.

It's foreign on this side,
And the truth is a bitter friend.
But reasons few have I to go back again.

Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day.
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain.
There's no path to follow, once you're here.
You'll climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs.

It's foreign on this side,
But it feels like I'm home again.
There's no place to hide
But I don't think I'm scared.
(there's no place to hide)
(there's no place to hide)
But I don't think I'm scared.
(there's no place to hide)
But I don't think I'm scared...",2002
Saturday Sun,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/saturdaysun.html,"Saturday sun
Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Saturday sun
Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday's sun
Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by",1969
You Don't Own Me,Lesley Gore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lesleygore/youdontownme.html,"You don't own me, I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me, don't say I can't go with other boys

And don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And please when I go out with you
Don't put me on display, 'cause
You don't own me, don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me, don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay

Oh, I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

And don't tell me what to do
Oh... don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

I don't tell you what to say
Oh-h-h-h don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want",1963
If You Have to Ask,Red Hot Chili Peppers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/redhotchilipeppers/ifyouhavetoask.html,"A wanna be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
Add a little lust
To the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space

Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

[Chorus:]
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

Don't ask me why
I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville

I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood

[Chorus]",1991
Home,Zero 7,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/zero7/home.html,"Lost in cheap delirium
Searching the neon lights
I move carefully
Sink in the city aquarium
Sing in the key of night
As they're watching me

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
'Cause lately I've been losing on my own

Wrapped in silent elegance
Beautifully broken down
As illusions burst
Too late to learn from experience
Too late to wonder how
To finish first

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
'Cause lately I've been losing on my own

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Won't you take me home
Won't you take me home
'Cause lately I've been losing on my own
Won't you take me home",2004
Underneath It All,No Doubt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nodoubt/underneathitall.html,"Hey, you don't have to forget
Just remember this Sunday, alright

There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're
You're something else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better... better

[Lady Saw:]
For real
'Cause underneath it all
You are my real Prince Charming
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Any time you're around
My body keeps calling
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side of you
And this a woman you adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh you're good for me, baby
Of that I'm sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

[Gwen:]
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
And I really love you
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

Underneath it all
Underneath it all
Underneath it all
Underneath it all",2001
Should I Stay or Should I Go?,The Clash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/clash/shouldistayorshouldigo.html,"Darlin' you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine

Should I stay or should I go?

Mr. Intentional,Lauryn Hill,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/laurynhill/mrintentional.html,"Yeah, yeaaayh, yeah heh, yeah heh, yeah heh...
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional
All their talk, is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity, to further situation
Why they so important, is without explanation
Please don't patrionize me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, ohhh, ohh ohhh
We give rise to ego, by being insecure
The advice that we go, desperatly searching for
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does
Counting all the money, that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh undementional, Mr. Intentional
Ohhh, oh don't you do me any favors
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohh ohhhh
Wake up you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh it's nobody else's fault
Except the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh oh oh
See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live, is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give, is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh I dont need your sympthy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional
So undementional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional
Ohhh ohhhh, ohhhh",2002

The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,Gil Scott-Heron,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gilscottheron/therevolutionwillnotbetelevised.html,"You will not be able to stay home, brother
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and
Skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
In 4 parts without commercial interruptions
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon
Blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John
Mitchell, General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by the
Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie
Wood and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia
The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs
The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner
Because the revolution will not be televised, Brother

There will be no pictures of you and Willie May
Pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run
Or trying to slide that color TV into a stolen ambulance
NBC will not be able to predict the winner at 8:32
On reports from 29 districts
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of Whitney Young being
Run out of Harlem on a rail with a brand new process
There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy
Wilkins strolling through Watts in a Red, Black and
Green liberation jumpsuit that he has been saving
For just the proper occasion

Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville
Junction will no longer be so damned relevant, and
Women will not care if Dick finally got down with
Jane on Search for Tomorrow because Black people
Will be in the street looking for a brighter day
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no highlights on the eleven o'clock
News and no pictures of hairy armed women
Liberationists and Jackie Onassis blowing her nose
The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb or
Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom
Jones, Johnny Cash, Engelbert Humperdinck, or The Rare Earth
The revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be right back
After a message about a white tornado, white lightning, or white people
You will not have to worry about a dove in your
Bedroom, a tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl
The revolution will not go better with Coke
The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised
Will not be televised, will not be televised
The revolution will be no re-run brothers
The revolution will be live",1971

Don't Let It Bring You Down,Neil Young,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/dontletitbringyoudown.html,"Old man lying
By the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking
From the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky

Cold wind ripping
Down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying
By the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Blind man running
Through the light
Of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down
To the river of sight
And you can really understand

Red lights flashing
Through the window
In the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying
In a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around",1970

But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)

Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time let's talk about it
And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted

Red Right Hand,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/redrighthand.html,"Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul,
but there won't be a single thing
that you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car? 
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand",1994
The Canals Of Our City,Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/thecanalsofourcity.html,"Walls gone over the sea

Sleep to Dream,Fiona Apple,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fionaapple/sleeptodream.html,"I tell you how I feel
But you don't care
I say tell me the truth
But you don't dare
You say love is a hell
You cannot bear
And I say gimme mine
Back and then go there
For all I care
I got my feet
On the ground
And I don't go to
Sleep to dream
You got your head
In the clouds
And you're not at
All what you seem
This mind, this body
And this voice cannot be
Stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you
Don't come around
I got my own hell to raise

I have never been
So insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas
To wash down all this pride
First you run like a fool
Just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool
But you just run to hide
And I can't abide

I got my feet
On the ground
And I don't go
To sleep to dream
You got your head
In the clouds and
You're not at all
What you seem
This mind, this body
And this voice cannot be
Stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you
Don't come around
I got my own hell to raise

Don't make it a big deal
Don't be so sensitive
We're not playing
A game anymore
You don't have
To be so defensive
Don't you plead me your case
Don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face
'Cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock
From under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave
And all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame

I got my feet
On the ground
And I don't go
To sleep to dream
You got your head
In the clouds and
You're not at all
What you seem
This mind, this body
And this voice cannot be
Stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget
What I told you
Don't come around
I got my own hell to raise",1996

Astral Weeks,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/astralweeks.html,"If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Would you kiss-a my eyes?
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I'm pushin' on the door
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?

Standin' with the look of avarice
Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter
Showin' pictures on the wall
Whisperin' in the hall
And pointin' a finger at me
There you go, there you go
Standin' in the sun darlin'
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before
There you go
Takin' good care of your boy
Seein' that he's got clean clothes
Puttin' on his little red shoes
I see you know he's got clean clothes
A-puttin' on his little red shoes
A-pointin' a finger at me
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Lookin' straight at you
Comin' through, darlin'

Between the viaducts of your dreams
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Worried dream
Break my heart
With your sad scream

Sun is down
Spirits low
Hate my impatience
And here I go

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try?
Can't we try?

Come on, sleep one night peacefully
When I'll yawn all day easily
And rest up my mind

Weary guise
Mine the same
Why so worried?
You can't explain

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try?
Can't we try?

Come on, sleep one night peacefully
Then I'll yawn all day easily",2000
Take A Chance,The Magic Numbers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/magicnumbers/takeachance.html,"What You gonna do when it all breaks down

But then You dance dance dance with the woman that let's you
How's it gonna feel until I catch You
What You gonna do when she turns around

Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?",2006

She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery bog
Throwing troubles to the dying embers

She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution

She's got a paradise camouflage
Like a whip-crack sending me shivers
She's the boat in a strip mine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers

She's alone in the new pollution",1996

I said for goodness sake 
That man's got the power 
he's a charmer with a snake

but somehow liberated, 
When you took me to a place I'd never been. 
You showed me lots of things I'd never seen 

You set me free 
as if you'd taken me, 
Halfway up the Hindu Kush 
And I love you, 
for showing me the view 
from halfway up the Hindu Kush 

The next time that I saw you, you looked into my eyes 
I was sitting on your carpet when I felt it begin to rise. 
I kinda got the feeling, 
I was floating to the ceiling, 
Instead of looking at the sky 
you picked me up and showed me how to fly. 

You set me free, as if you'd taken me, 
Halfway up the Hindu Kush 
And I love you 
for showing me the view, 
From halfway up the Hindu Kush 

From halfway up the Hindu, 
from halfway up the Hindu, 
From halfway up the Hindu Kush.

Hurts to hold

I walk out in stormy weather
Hold my words, keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip

Night time
Sympathize
I've been working on
White lies
So I'll tell the truth
I'll give it up to you
And when the day comes
It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon

My eyes gleam
Looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather
Hope my words keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip

Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then),The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/yankeebayonetiwillbehomethen.html,"[Soldier:]
Heart-carved tree trunk, Yankee bayonet
A sweetheart left behind

[Girl:]
Far from the hills and the sea-swelled Carolinas
That's where my true love lies

[Soldier:]
Look for me when the sun-bright swallow
Sings upon the birch bough high

[Girl:]
But you are in the ground with the wolves and the weevils
All a-chew upon your bones so dry

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave?
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
Then

[Girl:]
When I was a girl how the hills of Oconee
Made a seam to hem me in

[Soldier:]
There at the fair when our eyes caught, careless
Got my heart right pierced by a pin

[Soldier:]
But O did you see all the dead of Manassas
All the bellies and the bones and the bile?

[Girl:]
No, I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with child

But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then

[Soldier:]
Stems and bones and stone walls too
Could keep me from you
This skein of skin is all too few
To keep me from you

[Soldier and Girl:]
But O my love though our bodies may be parted
Though our skin may not touch skin
Look for me with the sun-bright sparrow
I will come on the breath of the wind",2006

Doing the things a particle can
What's he like? It's not important

Is he a dot, or is he a speck?
When he's underwater does he get wet?
Or does the water get him instead?
Nobody knows, Particle man

Triangle man, Triangle man
Triangle man hates particle man
They have a fight, Triangle wins

Universe man, Universe man
Size of the entire universe man
Usually kind to smaller man
Universe man

He's got a watch with a minute hand,
Millenium hand and an eon hand
When they meet it's a happy land
Powerful man, universe man

Person man, person man
Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can
Person man

Is he depressed or is he a mess?
Does he feel totally worthless?
Who came up with person man?
Degraded man, person man

They have a fight, triangle wins

Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do
Nobody does it anymore

No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine

Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind

Being young and beautiful, In love with no one
But yourself

You're so cruel

Rockin' The Suburbs,Ben Folds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/rockinthesuburbs.html,"Let me tell y'all what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
It's a b*tch, if you don't believe
Listen up to my new CD
(Sha-mon) 

I got sh*t runnin' throught my brain
It's so intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white-boy pain
Shake your booty while the band complains

I'm rockin' the suburbs
Just like Michael Jackson did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the cheques and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my sh*tty tracks

I'm p*ssed off but I'm too polite
When people break in the McDonald's line
Mom and Dad you made me so uptight
I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight

I don't know how much I can take
Girl, give me something I can break

I'm rockin' the suburbs
Just like Quiet Riot did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that they were talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the cheques and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my sh*tty tracks

In a haze these days
I pull up to the stop light
I can feel that something's not right
I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate
And bass
Sendin' dirty vibes my way
'Cause my great great great great Grandad
Made someones' great great great great Grandaddies slaves
It wasn't my idea
It wasn't my idea
Never was my idea

I just drove to the store
For some Preparation-H

Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle class and white

It gets me real p*ssed off, it makes me wanna say
It gets me real p*ssed off and it makes me wanna say
It gets me real p*ssed off and it makes me wanna say
F*CK!

Just like Jon Bon Jovi did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the cheques and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my sh*tty tracks

These days
Yeah yeah
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Yeah yeah
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Yeah yeah

You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'F*ck'
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'F*ck'
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'F*ck'
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'F*ck'",2001
One Four Five,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/onefourfive.html,"Listen doctor I have pain 
That grows inside myself 
Shelf me please 
I just can't ease the pain 
I need some drugs to help 
Ah pollution fills my lungs 
And convolution fills my mind 
Ah my legs do ache 
I contemplate 
That living's less than fine 
My spine does tingle 
When I think of being 
Freed from this curse 
But what is worse I feel 
Life is a bubble 
Blown until it's burst 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
To get rid of this feeling 
Oh doctor I am desperate 
For some good soul healing 

The doctor turned and gave a grin 
And reached into his bag 
But instead of an injection 
Got a record with a tag 
That said listen to this daily 
With hip shaking and such things 
Then he puts the record on 
Grabs a mic and starts to sing 
You need some 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
To make you high to make you high 
When heaven falling from the sky 
To make you high to make you high 

Doctor I am feeling better 
What was that you sang 
Did you write it or recite it 
Or just steal it from a band 
Ah my bones are feeling stronger 
And my spirit's feeling fresh 
Ah that dose of 145 has put the life 
Back in my breath 
'yes yes yes' the doctor said 
Then he sat me down and say 
'young man don't think I wrote 
These chords they're written in 
Your brain' 
And when you hear them 
There's a shakedown that begins within 
The mind 
Cos these three chords make people 
Feeling better all the time ah 
They keep repeating 
Like a scratch on a cd 
But it's quality cos these three harmonies 
Breed positivity 
Protecting against insanity 
Of modern insecurities 
Believe me when I tell you 
All you need is to be hearing all that 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
To make you high to make you high 
When they said what and you said why 
To make you high to make you high 

The doctor turned and gave a grin 
And reached into his bag 
But instead of an injection 
Got a record with a tag 
That said listen to this daily 
With hip shaking and such things 
Then he puts the record on 
Grabs a mic and starts to sing 
You need some 

One four five 
To make you high to make you high 
When you could not count to pi 
When you're told you can't fly 
To make you high to make you high 

Times like these you need some 
One four five .... hhhuuummnn",2003
The Mariner's Revenge Song,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/themarinersrevengesong.html,"We are two mariners
Our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs are ceiling beams
Its guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you
And I will relay to you
How our histories interweave

At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease

As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind

Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried,
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat

But never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty

The following day
I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind
I could almost hear
(oh, oh)

""Find him, bind him,
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave.

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea:
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed.""

And then, that fateful night,
We had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath

The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale
(oh, oh)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive as well as me

It gives my heart great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(oh, oh)",2005
Natural Anthem,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/naturalanthem.html,"I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing
It will be a natural anthem, familiar it will seem
It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day

I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places I have taken from real life
So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right...",2003

A recording for Blue Note Records

What's that? Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait, wait a minute

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya dont stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
(Yeah...yeah...yeah...Funky, funky)

Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Black Friday Rule,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/blackfridayrule.html,"I want to believe in myself once again 
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end 
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you 
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye 
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy 
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold 
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane 
Flew all the way to California 
This mess in my head is a mess getting out 
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry 
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine 
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed 
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still 
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill 
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe 
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

So I must remain in my new adopted land 
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can 
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name 
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule",2000
Live For Real,K's Choice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kschoice/liveforreal.html,"Life has always been a pretty song
And pretty loud
You're so beautiful
Why is it fading out
I don't want to live forever
But as long as I do
I'd love to live for real
Now the boy who dried your tears
Is crying all the time
Now the joy I've had for years
Has left me for a while
I don't want to live forever
But as long as I do
I'd love to live for real
With you I might get there
With you I might start to feel
With you I will get there
With you I will live for real
I will breathe the air, I'll dance
And you will wonder why
It's because you made me see
This chance was moving by
Because I'm not going to live forever
But as long as I do
I'd love to live for real
With you I might get there
With you I might start to feel
With you I will get there
With you I will live for real

Play your music loud instead
And we'll dance until
The both of us are dead",2000

When you cut me loose 
Floating on an ocean 
And confused 
Winds are whipping waves up 
Like sky scrapers 
And the harder they hit me 
The less I seem to bruise 

Oh when I 
Find the controls 
I'll go where I like 
I'll know where I want to be 
But maybe for now 
I'll stay right here 
On a silent sea

Save Me,Jem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jem/saveme.html,"Save me save me save me wooh

I've gotta stop my mind

Save me ah wooh
Save me ah ah save me ah ah

Crazy thoughts have quick wings
Gaining momentum fast
One minute I am fine
The next I've lost my mind
To a fake fantasy

And none of these 
Thoughts are real
So why is it that I feel
So cut up and so bad
I need to take control
Coz my mind is on a roll
And it isn't listening to me

Wasted energies are flowing
Anger, pain and sadness beckon
Panic sets in in a second
Be aware it's just your mind
And you can stop it anytime

Save me ah ah save me ah ah
Save me ah wooh

The Dumbing Down Of Love,Frou Frou,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/froufrou/thedumbingdownoflove.html,"Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love

Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without
Without love

No no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
Cause no-one's receiving
This tunnel vision
Is turning out all wrong

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love
Without love
Without love

Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
Will you listen
Lover alone without love
Without love

Without love
Without love

True Affection,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/trueaffection.html,"I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea

You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Down to the bottom

I wanted a junction and often there was one
You'd surfaced face-first and we'd
Share thought bubbles and
I still believe in the phrases that we breathed
But I know the distance isn't fair to cross

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

Your depths made a pressure that
Punctured my works and all your fluids couldn't tolerate the
Force of my thirst
I love the place where we shared our tiny grace
But just because its real don't mean its gonna work

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer

And true affection floats
True affection sinks
Like a stone
I never felt so close
I never felt so all alone

I was out of your league
And you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Wanted you nearer",2006

Ghost of Corporate Future,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/ghostofcorporatefuture.html,"A man walks out of his apartment,
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings,
Trying to save his suit,
Trying to save his suit.
Trying to dry, and to dry, and to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform,
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""
Everyone who sees him says, ""Ew.""

But he doesn't care,
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Ghost of Corporate Future
The ghost said, ""Take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet.""

He also said,
""Imagine you go away
On a business trip one day
And when you come back home,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan,
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan.""

""And people make you nervous
You'd think the world is ending,
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic,
And everyone's sarcastic,
And all your food is frozen,
It needs to be defrosted.""

""You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending,
You'd think the world was ending right now.""

""Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee,
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news,
Maybe you should kiss someone nice,
Or lick a rock,
Or both.""

""Maybe you should cut your own hair
'Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead""

""And people are just people,
They shouldn't make you nervous.
The world is everlasting,
It's coming and it's going.
If you don't toss your plastic,
The streets won't be so plastic.
And if you kiss somebody,
Then both of you'll get practice.""

""The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
Put dirtballs in your pocket,
And take off both your shoes.
'Cause people are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.
People are just people,
People are just people,
People are just people like you.""

Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/goodoldfashionedloverboy.html,"I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two

What're you doin' tonight, hey, boy?
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned loverboy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all

I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey, boy?
Write my letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone (Yeah)

When I'm not with you, think of you always

I miss you
When I'm not with you, think of me always

Hey, boy, where do you get it from?
Hey, boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned
School of loverboys

Dining at The Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)

Ooh love (there he goes again)

There's nothin' more a man can do 
Don't get your bollocks in a twist 
Settle down, don't take a fit 
Ya drank with demons straight form Hell 
They almost nearly won as well 
Ya wiped the floor with victory 
Then puked until you fell asleep

Blackened was the banshee's wail 
These boot will never fill her jail 
So you crawled into an empty boat 
For the Gulf of Mexico 
Till Cortez came an' when so did you 
From the ashes charred and blue 
Smellin' like a Salty Dog 
Back from Hell where you belong

Anarchy, the scourge of every sea 
The Antichrist aboard a rig 
With us your cutthroat thieves 
The ship went down we all near drowned 
Ya stood there on the deck 
Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse 
And dragged you from the wreck

They threw a rope around yer neck 
To watch you dance the jig of death 
Then left ya for the starvin' crows 
Hoverin' like hungry whores 
One flew down plucked out yer eye 
The other he had in his sights 
Ya snarled at him, said leave me be 
I need the bugger so I can see",2000

Life on Mars?,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/lifeonmars.html,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sound and Vision,David Bowie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/soundandvision.html,"Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, 
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude,
over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision",1977
Walking In Memphis,Marc Cohn,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marccohn/walkinginmemphis.html,"Put on my blue suede shoes and
I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
And she's down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian, child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight!""

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Put on my blue suede shoes and I
Boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain",1991

All your hugs and kisses and your money, too
Well, you know you love me, baby
Still you tell me, maybe
That some day, well, I'll be blue

He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me, an' you told me boldly
That someday, well, I'll be blue

Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry

Then it's gone from sight

I'll just stay a victim

Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothers and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustling, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them

At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie

Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognize
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

Standin in front of the judge with no honor

Nothing's changed

A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never ? I never !
Who said I'd lied because I never ?
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my knee
And broke my spleen

Who said I'd lied to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied ? - because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied ? - because I never

Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...

You Can't Steal My Love,Mando Diao,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mandodiao/youcantstealmylove.html,"I was walking down the street 
with my chains chains chains 
tied up to my feet 
I leaned instead of jiggie 
with the sidewalk 
Now this street tells the same old boring tale 
that has failed in so many ways of life 
To trust its stories 
you've got to be dull as them 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah, yeah!!! 

I met her in a crowded room 
where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand 
I watched her beauty from an armchair 
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film 
with those kids in New York in the eighties 
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway"" 

And all the love I've got in here

betrayer, 
you stinking master of trusts

You cannot touch our hearts 
when we're in bloom 
I assume that we'll win over the heads again 
We conceal non, 
you'll feel none, 
that's what I promise 

And all the love we've got in store, 
you can't kill You peasants! 
We won it all 
And the love I have for her 
you cannot touch,

Half Asleep,School of Seven Bells,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/schoolofsevenbells/halfasleep.html,"Sometimes I go whole days
listening bored, half asleep
I won't say anything
that's worth a thing to me
One day, suddenly, time
took a turn that once felt so brief
I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly

What begins as an unguarded
train of thought slowly can become
an addiction to the slumber
of disconnection and the resonance
of memory that no longer has a shape
but keeps you numb through
the hours till gone is another day

Be aware, my darling
these things I say I mean
are just traces of something
I long to feel again
I see our time expand
in the air almost forcibly,
spreading thinner till it dissolves completely",2008

At the hop, it's greaseball heaven
With candy pants and Archie too

Put me in your dry dream
Or put me in your wet
If you haven't yet
No, if you haven't yet

Light me with your candle
And watch the flames grow high
No, it doesn't hurt to try
It doesn't hurt to try

Well, I won't stop all of my pretending
That you'll come home
You'll be coming home someday soon

Put me in your blue skies
Or put me in your grey
There's gotta be some way
There's gotta be some way

Put me in your tongue tie
Make it hard to say
That you ain't gonna stay
That you ain't gonna stay

Wrap me in your marrow
Stuff me in your bones
Sing a mending moan
A song to bring you home",2004
I'm All Right,Madeleine Peyroux,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madeleinepeyroux/imallright.html,"He made me laugh
He made me cry
He smoked his stogies in bed
But I'm all right
I'm all right
I've been lonely before
I asked the boy for a few kind words
He gave me a novel instead
But I'm all right
I'm all right
I've been lonely before
It's fine, it's OK
It was wrong either way
I just wanted to say
There isn't much fun when you're drinking wine
He got drunk, he fell down
He threw a few of my things around
But I'm all right
I'm all right
I've been lonely before

I'd like to believe that it's easy to leave
But I have to conceive that wherever you are
You're still driving my car
Sticks and stones break my bones
But tears don't leave any scars
So I'm all alright
I'm all alright
I've been lonely before

Mmm...
I'm all alright
I'm all alright
I'm all alright
Yeah

Used to blow bubbles in bed

I Feel Loved,Depeche Mode,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/depechemode/ifeelloved.html,"It's the dark night of my soul
And temptation's taking hold
But through the pain and the suffering
Through the heartache and trembling

I feel loved
I feel loved

As the darkness closes in
In my head I hear whispering
Questioning and beckoning
But I'm not taken in

I feel loved
I feel loved

From the depths of my emptiness
Comes a feeling of inner bliss
I feel wanted, I feel desired
I can feel my soul on fire

I feel loved
I feel loved",2001

Call it sin, you can call it whatever,
Eating deep inside of you
Well if it were me it's all I'd ever do
Steal me now and forever
I'll steal something good for you
The criminal in me is no one new
Till you find something better
When there's nothing left to use
And everything starts going down on you
I'm the Generator, firing whenever you quit
Yeah whatever it is, you go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it
Send me out on a tether
Swing it round I'll spin your noose
You let it down
I'll hang around with you, till you find someone better
When there's no one left to use, and everyone keeps going down",1999

Mudfootball,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/mudfootball.html,"Saturday morning and it's time to go 
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well... 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Sunday morning and it's time to go 
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
We're talking kinda funny from helium 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Monday morning and it's time to go 
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
Meet her by the sugar mill after school

Don't Stop Believin',Journey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/journey/dontstopbelievin.html,"Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on, and on, and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on, and on, and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

Tell me your secrets and I'll

The one thing missing was you

And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh under the moon glow down in Mexico I dreamed
One thing was missing that's you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We won't need a compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, as long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I wanna share the world with you, you see
Spring time in Paris feels so good to me
Oh this is for me reality
So please make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me my love,

To turn into something

On the horizon 
I couldnât see it 
Until I let go 
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn

And feelinâ my world start to turn 

And Iâll taste every moment 
And live it out loud

This is the time 
To be more than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 

Holding onto things that vanished 
Into the air 
Left me in pieces 
But now Iâm rising from the ashes 
Finding my wings 
And all that I needed 
Was there all along 
Within my reach 
As close as the beat of my heart 

So Iâll taste every moment 
And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be 
More than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 

And Iâm out on the edge of forever 
Ready to run 
Iâm keeping my feet on the ground 
My arms open wide 
My face to the sun

And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be 
More than a name 
Or a face in the crowd

Since you came along
And before you
I had nowhere to run to
Nothing to hold on to
I came so close to giving it up.
And I wonder if you know
How it feels to let you go?

You say goodbye in the pouring rain
And I break down as you walk away.

Apples In The Trees,Mirah,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mirah/applesinthetrees.html,"There should be no hesitation

What a way to compromise 
It's a long long way 
Before you get to claim that final prize 

Looking at that sorry face 
I can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night 
The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me, 
There's food for you 
There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide 
And there is love beyond compare 

There's apple in the trees 
Let's take all that we need

There's no escape so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see

I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

I'll never give up on you

Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?

How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning under the same sun?
By now we say it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really wanna play?

We could close our eyes, it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we gonna blame now?

And, oh, it's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home

I can close my eyes, it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I can close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all

It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
And who we gonna blame on and on?

It's just a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame",2005
Times Like These,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/timeslikethese.html,"In times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on...
On and on it goes

And there has always been laughing, crying, birth, and dying
Boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
But then hurt from time to time like these
And times like those
And what will be will be
And so it goes

And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
Action,Reaction, sticks and stones and broken bones
Those for peace and those for war
And god bless these ones, not those ones
But these ones made times like these
And times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on...
On and on it goes

But somehow I know it won't be the same
Somehow I know it will never be the same.",2003
I'm Looking Through You,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/imlookingthroughyou.html,"I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you",1965
Take It from Me,The Weepies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weepies/takeitfromme.html,"What can I compare you to, a favorite pair of shoes? 
Maybe my bright red boots if they had wings
Funny how we animate colorful objects saved
Funny how it's hard to take a love with no sting.

But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me 
But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me (we`ve got a good life).

What can I compare you to, a window the sun shines through? 
Maybe the silver moon, a smile rising
The magic of the fading day, satellites on parade
A toast to the plans we've made to live like kings.

I lose my breath despite the air
When the rain falls down I give in to despair
Pink magnolia in winter she doesn't care 
if you don't show up to have another cup.

What can I compare you to, when everything looks like you? 
I get a bit confused with every Spring
Flowers that bloom your eyes, hummingbirds side by side
My heart won't stay entirely in this rib caging",2006

Whistling our favorite tune
Trying to get a closer view

Song for Myla Goldberg,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/songformylagoldberg.html,"Myla Goldberg sets a steady hand upon her brow 
Myla Goldberg hangs a crooked foot all upside down 

It comes around it comes around 
It comes around it comes around 

Pretty hands do pretty things when pretty times arise 
Seraphim and seaweed swim where stick-limbed Myla lies 

It comes around it comes around 
It comes around it comes around 

Still now you're waiting to grow 
Inside you're old 
Sew wings to your pigeon toes 
Put paper to pen 
to spell out ""Eliza"" 

We begin with sticky shins make sticky then our shoes 
Shoes beget to clothes and hat 'til sticky's sticking too 

Finiculi finicula finiculi finicula 

Listen in as shin-kicked Jim relates his story sad 
About a boy who kicked until his shins were all but rubberbands 
But now 

I know New York I need New York 
I know I need unique New York 

Still now you're waiting to grow 
Inside you're old 
Sew wings to your pigeon toes 
Put paper to pen 
to spell out ""Eliza""

Red Right Ankle,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/redrightankle.html,"This is the story of your red right ankle 
And how it came to meet your leg 
And how the muscle bone and sinews tangled 
And how the skin was softly shed 
And how it whispered, 
""Oh, adhere to me for we are bound by symmetry 
And whatever differences our lives have been 
We together make a limb"" 
This is the story of your red right ankle 

This is the story of your gypsy uncle 
You never knew cause he was dead 
And how his face was carved an ripped with wrinkles 
In the picture in your head 
And remember how you found the key 
To his hide-out in the Pyrenees, 
But you wanted to keep his secret safe, 
So you threw the key away? 
This is the story of your gypsy uncle 

This is the story of the boys who loved you 
Who love you now and loved you then 
And some were sweet and some were cold and snuffed you 
And some just layed around in bed 
And some, they crumbled you straight to your knees 
Did it cruel, did it tenderly 
Some they crawled their way into your heart 
To rend your ventricles apart 
This is the story of the boys who loved you 
This is the story of your red right ankle",2003

O Valencia,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/ovalencia.html,"You belong to the gang
And you say you can't break away
But I'm here with my hands on my heart

Our families can't agree
I'm your brother's sworn enemy
But I'd shout out my love to the stars

So await for the stone on your window, your window
I'll await by the car and we'll go, we'll go

When first we laid eyes
I swore to no compromise
'Til I felt my caress on your skin

Well, how soon we were betrayed!
Your sister gave us away
And your father came all unhinged

So await for the stone on your window, your window
I'll await by the car and we'll go, we'll go

But O Valencia!
With your blood still warm on the ground
Valencia!
And I swear to the stars
I'll burn this whole city down

All I heard was the shout
Of your brother calling me out
And you ran like a fool to my side

Well, the shot, it hit hard
And your frame went limp in my arms
And an oath of love was your dying cry

So await for the stone on your window, your window
I'll await by the car and we'll go, we'll go

But O Valencia!
With your blood still warm on the ground
Valencia!
And I'll burn this whole city down
Valencia!
With your blood getting cold on the ground

I'll burn this whole city down",2006
Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/hereidreamtiwasanarchitect.html,"And here I dreamt I was a soldier
And I marched the streets of Burkenau
And I recall in spring
The perfume that the air would bring
To the indolent town
Where the barkers call the moon down
The carnival was ringing loudly now
And just to lay with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And I am nothing of a builder
But here I dreamt I was an architect
And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world
But the angles and the corners
Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, okay, guess it's better to turn this way

And here in Spain I am a Spaniard
I will be buried with my marionettes
Countess and courtesan
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
While you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seat belts on
We live this close to death

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this
But I won, so you lose
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way",2002
A Cautionary Song,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/acautionarysong.html,"There's a place your mother goes
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoats
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach

With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle
And she's laid in bed on the upper deck

And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Til at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions, and their opinions

And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her thirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed, and this is how you're fed

So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep",2002
The Legionnaire's Lament,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/thelegionnaireslament.html,"I'm a legionnaire
Camel in disrepair
Hoping for a Frigidaire to come passing by
I am on reprieve
Lacking my joie de vivre
Missing my gay Paree
In this desert dry

And I wrote my girl
Told her I would not return
I've terribly taken a turn
For the worse now, I fear

It's been a year or more
Since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war
So far away from my home

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again

La la la la dam
La la la low

Medicating in the sun
Pinch doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage!
A bottle of ancient Chiraz!
The smattering of distant applause
Is ringing in my poor ears

On the old left bank
My baby in a charabanc
Riding up the width and length
Of the Champs Elysee

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again

If only summer rain would fall
On the houses and the boulevards
And the side walk bagatelles (it's like a dream)
With the roar of cars
And the lolling of the cafe bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine

Be back again
Be back again
I'll be back again",2002
Freedom Hangs Like Heaven,Iron & Wine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/freedomhangslikeheaven.html,"Mary, carry your babe
Bound up tight like lips around a whimper
Your fingers over my face
Blind eyed Samson driven to the temple
And night birds digging until dawn
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But his mama says he'll walk on water
And wander back home

Mary, carry your shame
Well past all those eyes across the avenue
Fish heads running from rain
You know i'll do anything you want me to
Lamp oil lovers may say
""freedom hangs like heaven over everyone""
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But his papa's going to hide shaking gristle
And shaking like bone

Mary, carry my name
Hoof marks hacked up all i had to offer you
Looked all over this place
Lost your portrait lately when the winter blew
In like herod and them
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But a dollar says he'll lick that devil
And do it alone",P:

She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow

Baby went to Amsterdam
4-5 days by the big canal
Now it's so slow, so slow

And I was heading up north to a place that I know
Eating well, sleeping well
But still I was way, way out of line
Amsterdam was stuck in my mind

Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone

Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow

Baby went to Amsterdam
4-5 days by the big canal

Working hard, fill my time

Within a Mile of Home,Flogging Molly,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/floggingmolly/withinamileofhome.html,"Dust falls on the empty halls of my old school
Where the memories fade like the casualty, a forgotten fool
Now the wide-eyed has become the blind of spoken rule
As equal only deep is now the word
The lesson's not the answer you once heard

""Don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down""
She said, ""I picked you up each time before you hit the ground
Your selfish face is now erased when someone mentions you
And the darkness that you left is overstepped aside
With disappearing clouds, the sun arrives
Within a mile of home, within a mile of home""

Oh worry, oh my worry has it been that long?
The whistle keeps on blowing but the chills all gone
His empty frame cannot explain, there's nothing left inside
So sing to me a song from yesterday
When laughter filled the tears that we now make

""Don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down""
She said, ""I picked you up each time before you hit the ground
Your selfish face is now erased when someone mentions you
If only you had seen what I now see
And turned the corner where you would of been
Within a mile of home, within a mile of home""

So sing to me, sing me a song, a song from yesterday
And when the laughter turned these tears before the promises, then they'll slip away
Don't turn your back on me, don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down
Don't turn your back on me, don't turn your back on me, don't ever let me down
We are within a mile, we are within a mile, within a mile of home

Some backwards purpose 
It's enough to make me nervous.

But your lips when we speak

So let me walk these coals till you believe 
I can cut the mustard well enough 
Cause you know as soon as breathe we scrutinize 

Unknown quotients, you must be using potions 
How else could you tie my head to the sky 
This new convection has left me wondering why 
I can't concern myself with ordinary tripe. 

Like what's this morning's paper got to say 
And which brand of coffee to make 
This is no umbrella to take into the wind 
And before we begin is there nothing to kill this anxiety.

The Good Thing,Talking Heads,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/talkingheads/thegoodthing.html,"I will fight; will fight with my heart.
I will fight; will fight with understanding.
In my mind, the weather never changes
Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A straight line exists between me and the good things.
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.
So I say:
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.",1978

But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah",1969
Good Enough,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/goodenough.html,"Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough for you

Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself, and I don't mind
I can't say no to you

Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough
Its been such a long time coming, but I feel good

And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
Am I good enough for you to love me too?

So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no",2006

She Loves Me Not,Papa Roach,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paparoach/shelovesmenot.html,"When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize
That she could see inside my head

So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate
So I don't have to lose my head

This situation
Leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers
And watched my fears
Fly away

And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say
Sometimes she says she loves me not

But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Life's not fair
I'm a jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
It's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad on the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl
We're tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's alright baby we can scream and shout

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Ooh La La,Faces,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/faces/oohlala.html,"Poor old Granddad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways

""They'll trap you, then they use you
Before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show""

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger.
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger.

The Can Can's such a pretty show
They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars.

""Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way
Ooh la la""

Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/timmcgraw.html,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Well I walked past him and I give him a wink
He must think I am sexually impertinent
And we're always colliding like the elements
But does he really know me, do I really know him?

I should have noticed it before

My girlfriends said they saw before
Him looking at the boys, looking at the boys

In lessons I am dreaming about the girls that I know

I like a girl in uniform (school uniform)
I like a girl in uniform (school uniform)
I like a girl in (school uniform)

And now I know about all of this
There's plenty more that I can kiss
And when I think about the bliss
Of looking at the girls, looking at the girls, looking at the girls

I like a boy in uniform (school uniform)
Cos not everything is uniform (school uniform)
I wanna kiss everyone in uniform

The Whole of the Moon,The Waterboys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waterboys/thewholeofthemoon.html,"I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
But you saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed and I tried
You just knew
I sighed
But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers, and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

Yes, you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon",1985
Waterfall,The Stone Roses,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stoneroses/waterfall.html,"Chimes sing Sunday morn
Today's the day she's sworn
To steal what she never could own
And race from this hole she calls home

Now you're at the wheel
Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails
And fills up her brigantine sails

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall",1989

And if you want me to

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Maybe give me insight between black and white
And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
It's only life after all

Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety 'til I sank it
I'm crawling on your shores

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

I stopped by the bar at 3 A.M
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain

We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain

We go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine",1989
Stupidly Happy,XTC,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xtc/stupidlyhappy.html,"I'm stupidly happy
Everything's fine
I'm stupidly happy
My heart pumping wine
I'm stupidly happy
With idiot grin
I'm stupidly happy
It's surely a sin

All the birds of the air call your name as they land on my kitchen roof
All the fish in the lake do the same should you need extra proof

I'm stupidly happy
My vision is skewed
I'm stupidly happy
I'm coming unscrewed

And if the Devil walks up dressed in any disguise
I take him by the collars look him in the eye
I'm stupidly happy
Now you're my defence
I'm stupidly happy
This world's making sense

I'm stupidly happy
I roll like a train
I'm stupidly happy
With you in my brain

All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar
I'm a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are

I'm stupidly happy
Like the words to that song
I'm stupidly happy
No nothing not wrong
And should the Devil walk up with his business card out
I'll tear it to confetti with a grin and shout,
I'm stupidly happy
All of the time
I'm stupidly happy
Now you're mine",2000
Happy Kid,Nada Surf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nadasurf/happykid.html,"I'm just a happy kid
Stuck with the heart of a sad punk
Drowning in my id
Always searching like it's on junk
No matter who i hang out with
I can hear the clack clunk
Of the chains that pull the cars up 
The roller coaster mountain top so high
When it comes down it shoots back up
Straight back to the sky
I gotta laugh and then i'm asleep 
And then i walk around and wanna cry
Out at night to do the strand
The little candles make the bottles glow
Got ink all over my right hand
Getting crushes with no chance to grow
It's like i'll never ever land
There's always too much sun 
Or too much snow
I get slow days and no days
I get rusty and it's hard
But i get notions that oceans 
Are coming to my call
You can learn to get along
I'm just a happy kid
Stuck with the heart of an old punk
Drowning in my id
Always hungry like it's on junk
I'm just a happy kid",2002
The Hill,Bombay Bicycle Club,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bombaybicycleclub/thehill.html,"When we look at the Summer Sun; yellow and round.
So we go out to the hill and we lie down.
All but one sits in the corner.
Trying to find a way;

And alright let's go outside,
And ride, ride, rise to the meaning of life,
And we're crying.
We're all falling out.
I want to go back to old times.

And looking back, looking out at different things.
We flew too high; let the Sun burn our wings.
We never thought it would be us.
Let it all come fast; turn to dust.

And alright let's go outside,
And ride, ride, rise to the meaning of life,
And we're crying.
We're all falling out.
I want to go back to old times

And alright let's go outside,
And ride, ride, rise to the meaning of life,
And we're crying.
We're all falling out.
I want to go back to old times

Say what I know, you keep that oath.
I give you my word, you keep it.
Say what I know, you keep that oath.
You're shit at keeping secrets.

Say what I know, I know that oath.
I give you my word, you keep it.
Say what I know, I keep that oath.
You're shit at keeping secrets.

And alright let's go outside,
And ride, ride, rise to the meaning of life,
And we're crying.

Farther On,Vetiver,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vetiver/fartheron.html,"It was a good time
Good time to stop and watch the city breathe, doll
You know, now we're lost
And have nothing to lose

I remember simple things
How's a building get so tall?
No one way to explain
Since we have not yet seen all

The sights there are here to see
Only them will we finally revel in

The good times
Good times
Oh, the good times
Shouldn't be this hard to find

When I see the people standing there
Shy, cerebral in the lonely air
Disenchanted, stony eyes
Bored to tears, but dry inside

Farther on, they'll collide
Intimate, but still strangers
The dangers in each other's eyes

I remember simple things
How's a building get so tall?
No one way to explain
Since we have not yet seen all

The good times
Good times
Oh, the good times
Shouldn't be this hard to find",2004
Insistor,Tapes 'n Tapes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tapesntapes/insistor.html,"Kelly the insistor
Your brother is a blister
I'll be had if I'm in your dress tonight

When you go and you're all alone
Are you still afraid of home
Do you lie in bed with fright

Your father said I lost her
Your brother said I fought her
But I stood still and I'm in your arms tonight

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say good lies
And know that I will be your bail bond

Mickey the ol' lithper
Said hey there hey mister
My cold razor's edge will meet you in the light

When you go and you're on stage
Is your heart still filled with rage?
Do you still fight for lover's rights?

Challenge is for lovers
But I run my feet hurt
So I'll stay here and fight for lover's rights

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say good lies
And know that I will be your bail bond

Oh Kelly don't you go
Kelly don't you go
Kelly don't you go
I want you to know
That I've been trying, I've been lying
I've been stealing, I've been hiding
I will meet you in the grave
Kelly, Kelly, it's not your right
To be cheating, fighting and starting life
When my head and hands are tied to you so tight
Oh Kelly just tell me one more thing
Is it mine or is it some other ring
That you wear as we lie in bed tonight?

And Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh, Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh Kelly, who's the logger who's trees were felled with might?
And Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, Kelly, hold your water tight

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say goodbye

Will is my friend
Will sings like John
Goin' back to California

Will is the West Coast with me
Will is a past is a plenty
Will is a blue friend of mine
With whom I spend a whole lot of my time

The lemon tree it laughs at me
It's growin' beautifully
The little veins it would unwind
And it'll wrap your whole in time

Now let's have a glass of wine
Now let's have another glass of wine

This is the water in which we wade
This is our father, this is how he strayed
This is the wind and this is the breeze, Will

Will is my friend

The Bleeding Heart Show,The New Pornographers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newpornographers/thebleedingheartshow.html,"I leapt across three or four beds into your arms
Where I had hidden myself somewhere in your charm
Our golden handshake has been smashed into this shape.
It's taken magic to a primitive new place
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

We hunched together in one chair out on the deck
In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set
It looked as if I picked your name out of a hat
Next thing you know you are asleep in someone's lap
Watch 'em run, although it's the minimum, heroic

We quit the room
Quit so our thoughts could rest
Rest them, I'll never move?
That's when we grab a hold
Of whatever it is we fell into
Lousy with your content
With what the majestic cannot find
In business of your lives
The perception, it is wrong, mile after mile
The phantom taste drinking wine from your heels

We have arrived too late to play the bleeding heart show",2005
Mount Wroclai (Idle Days),Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/mountwroclaiidledays.html,"And I know when time
Will pass by slow
Without my heart
What can I do
You're in the halls
The bell gives way to a larger swell
Without my heart
What can I do, oh
Wroclai

And we grow fat
On the charms of our idle dreary days
Seen the shadows grow
See an ominous display
With no alarm
Could we say we'd have expected this way
Our desires have died
Give incent to play
Wroclai",2006
You Turn Me On I'm A Radio,Joni Mitchell,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/youturnmeonimaradio.html,"If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
Oh honey you turn me on
I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower
Waving for you
I'm a broadcasting tower
Waving for you
And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear
I know you don't like weak women
You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind
But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From ""Breakfast Barney""
To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now
If you're still listening there
If you're driving into town 
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
The lines are open",1972

And Friday I get my pay

Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey

Northern Sky,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/northernsky.html,"I never felt magic crazy as this

Brighten my northern sky

I've been a long time that I'm waiting
Been a long time that I'm blown
I've been a long time that I've wandered
Through the people I have known
Oh, if you would and you could
Straighten my new mind's eye

Would you love me for my money
Would you love me for my head
Would you love me through the winter
Would you love me âtil I'm dead
Oh, if you would and you could
Come blow your horn on high

I was there in 1968. 
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks.
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978.
I'm losing my edge.

To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin.
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties.

I'm losing my edge, but I was there.
I was there.
But I was there.

I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks.
But I was there.
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City.
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience.
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band.
I told him, ""Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime.""
I was there.
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids.
I played it at CBGB's.
Everybody thought I was crazy.

I was there.
I was there.
I've never been wrong.

I used to work in the record store. 
I had everything before anyone.
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan.
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes.
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988.

But I'm losing my edge to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent.
And they're actually really, really nice.

I'm losing my edge.

I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody.
Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits.
All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import.
I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87.
I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.

I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record.

I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables. 
I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars.

When you've had enough and you've given up 

Because I've kept my heart under control

Sweet summer night and I'm stripped to my sheets
Forehead is leaking, my AC squeaks
And a voice from the clock says, ""You're not gonna get tired""
My bed is a pool and the walls are on fire
Soak my head in the sink for a while
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you, we're going.

(I'm not sure where...
I'm not sure where, but I have seen you today)

It doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze, get a midnight meal
I point in the windows, you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard, smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go when our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yarn you'll be sleeping soon
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down, we'll go out again.

Don't cool off, I like your warmth.

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it whets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls, says that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you

Just you, just you, just you.",2009

Swimming in the sea, I know what to call you now.

Fly,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/fly.html,"Please give me a second grace,
Please give me a second face,
I've fallen far down, the first time around, 
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly

Please tell me your second name, 
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are, 
I just need your star for a day

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny, 
For it's really too hard for the fly",1970
War Pigs,Faith No More,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/faithnomore/warpigs.html,"Generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerers of death's construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning,
as you hear the bodies burning.
No more war pigs of the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.
Day of judgement, god is calling, 
on their knees the war pigs crawling.
Begging mercy for their sins,
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!",1989
Cattle Call,Eddy Arnold,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eddyarnold/cattlecall.html,"[Moan]
The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'
Out with the doggies bawl
Where spurs are jinglin' a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call [moan]

He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
[Moan] Singin' this cattle call

For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call [moan]

He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl
[Moan] Singin' this cattle call... [moan]",1963

You could feel it cause it was the month of June

Shooting Stars,Bag Raiders,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bagraiders/shootingstars.html,"It's late and I'm awake
Staring at the wall
Open up my window
Head floats out the door

No one else around
The shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head
Blinded by the sky

Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Fall down to the ground

I know there's more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star 
But she moves so fast 
When she falls then
I'll be waiting",2010
The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!,Sufjan Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sufjanstevens/thepredatorywaspofthepalisadesisouttogetus.html,"Thinking outrageously I write in cursive 
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor 
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers 
I see my own breath on the face of the door 

Oh I am not quite sleeping 
Oh I am fast in bed 
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping 
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched 

North of Savanna we swim in the palisades 
I come out wearing my brother's red hat 
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times 
He runs washing his face in his hands 

Oh how I meant to tease him 
Oh how I meant no harm 
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him 
I see the wasp on the length of my arm 

Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu- 
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu- 
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu- 
trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu- 

We were in love. We were in love. 
Palisades! Palisades! Palisades 
I can wait. I can wait. 

Lamb of God, we sound the horn. 
Hallelujah! 
To us your ghost is born. 
Hallelu- 

I can't explain the state that I'm in 
The state of my heart, he was my best friend 
Into the car, from the back seat 
Oh admiration in falling asleep 
All of my powers, day after day 
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed 
Deep in the tower, the prairies below 
I can tell you, the telling gets old 
Terrible sting and terrible storm 
I can tell you the day we were born 
My friend is gone, he ran away 
I can tell you, I love him each day 
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged 
I can tell you I love him each day 
Terrible sting, terrible storm 
I can tell you...",2005

The color drain from my eyes

Make your heart molten somehow
Turn the fields of stone to magma

Swinging out on the breeze
I hear you singing, you're coming home
I can see you now

Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my
Honey wax

Thought I needed rodent teeth
Tough iron filings, diamonds cut
Bright steely shining

All the trouble that I've seen
Came on their wings, I threw them away
To rust in the rain
(Don't search 'em out)

Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my
Honey wax

Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my

Train Under Water,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/trainunderwater.html,"You were born inside of a raindrop 
I watched you falling to your death 
And the sun, well she could not save you
She'd fallen down too, now the streets are wet

Body of water
Toxic and timeless
Atlantic ocean
New York skyline
I always get lost
When I leave the village
So I couldn't come meet you 
In Brooklyn last night

But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace to the people I meet
While the world waits for an explosion 
That instant of life
That wipes the slate clean

So don't be fooled
No don't get lied to
Love was always cruel

And don't act strange
Don't be a stranger
It happened to me, now it's happening to you

But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through

Well if I could tame
All of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems
That it's always changing
The winds indecision 
The sorrowful rain

Yeah, I was a postcard
I was a record
I was a camera
Until I went blind

And now I'm riding
All over this island
Looking for something 
To open my eyes

But I still sing glory from my high rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time, when we'll be set free

So don't stay mad
Just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new

And if I don't come back
I mean if I get side tracked
It's only cause I wanted to

I'm keeping up with the moon on an all night avenue",2005

Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son... 
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun 
All I want to do is love everyone...

In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)

That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away

For I am the parasite of this town

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two

I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you might see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt",1972
Bananas and Blow,Ween,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ween/bananasandblow.html,"Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man
""Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry, 
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada,
And I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high""

Bananas & Blow (oh - oh), Bananas & Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas & Blow

Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall at the cantina
Eating the bananas and the cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here

Hangin' out shootin' shit
Tries to tell me somethin'
I play it off legit
So pleasant when the sails
Of the seas of orion gently slip
No need for god's sorrow
I play it off legit

Dude's hounding this bitch
I'm checkin' out the shit laughing
Later on I'll fuck her
She knows I'm legit
A sexy scorpion that stings her with wit
I play it off legit

My ma bought me a cool shirt
When I wear it I'm the shit

When I found her, you split
When I'm on the go
You know I'm legit",1992

To the memories of yesterday's clouds

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been blinded but
Now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walk right by me

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been set free and I've been bound

rolling on the ground

There was nothing goin' down at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by Rock 'n' Roll

Despite all the amputations
You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station

Jenny said when she was just five years old
My parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars--
Ain't gonna help us at all

Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station

Mr Jones,Counting Crows,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/mrjones.html,"I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Oh, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody love you,
You can never be lonely

Well, I'mma paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very-very meaningful

Yeah well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody love me,
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely,

I wanna be a lion
Everybody wanna pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars,
But we got different reasons for that

Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""

I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you,
Oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television,
I wanna see me staring right back at me

We all want to be big stars,
But we don't know why
And we don't know how
But when everybody love me,
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars",1993
Falling for You,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/fallingforyou.html,"Holy cow! I think I've got one here
Now just what am I supposed to do?
I've got a number of irrational fears
That I'd like to share with you
First, there's rules about old goats like me
Hanging around with chicks like you
But I do like you and another one: 
You say 'like' too much

But I'm shaking at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
And I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you 

Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
Just as I was busting loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
Cos I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you - you're the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one 

I'm shaking at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
And I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you 

Holy sweet goddamn! You left your cello in the basement
I admired the glowing the stars
And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true
What could you possibly see in little ol' 3 chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready, let's do it baby

Take You on a Cruise,Interpol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/interpol/takeyouonacruise.html,"I'm timeless like a broken watch
And make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time
The pretence is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
An anatomy of kisses
And a teacher who tries
And knows how we'll disappear
Would you like to be my Missus
And a future with child
You know we can't get back from here
We can get away

Baby won't you try to find me
Baby won't you try to fight
Baby won't you try to find me
Maybe it will be alright

Along the way
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
We sail today
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or see a better tip in your life

I am the scavenger
Between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure
whether machines turn anyone
Are you the scavenger?
Between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure
whether machines turn anyone

Lady won't you try to find me
Lady there is no need to fight
Lady won't you try to find me
Lady it will be alright

We sail today
Tears drown in in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
Along the way
The sea will crowd us with lovers at night
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or receive a better tip in your life

I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time

Lady In A Blue Dress,Senses Fail,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sensesfail/ladyinabluedress.html,"Just like the lady in a blue dress,
You've got cigarettes on your breath.
Hair spray and some cheap perfume.
I'll put a little sour in your sweet,
You've got so much fucking tongue in cheek.
You want what you could never have.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure.

So you say that I am rated X,
You suffer from the lack of sex.
Black heart and your lipstick smeared.
Your points are trite and I'm too sober
To deal with you running over
Your same pathetic cliche lines.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure.

Don't try to be cute with me,
'Cause I know you hate yourself
And you'd end your stupid life now
But you're too spineless

Just like the lady in a blue dress
You've got cigarettes on your breath,
Hair spray and some cheap perfume.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,

Calling You,Blue October,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blueoctober/callingyou.html,"There's something that I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I've said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

Well expect me to be
Calling you to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

[Chorus:]
I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
It's so hard sometimes
Then I fell in love with you
Then came you
And you took that away
It's not so difficult
The world is not so difficult
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you

I only want to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

No need to be alone

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go

Day Is Done,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/dayisdone.html,"When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.",1969

Won't be long till the truth comes out 
First impressions never last 
Lover's bonds they hold so fast 

Restless future burning bright 
The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 

Welcome swallows dip and swing 
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
Rolling fog into my room 
Why did you give up on me so soon? 
So soon

Beautiful World,Colin Hay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/colinhay/beautifulworld.html,"My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like swimming in the sea
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free (or a woman if you are one)
I like swimming in the sea

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like drinking Irish tea
With a little bit of Lapsang Souchong
I like making my own tea

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like driving in my car
Roll the top down, sometimes I travel quite far
Drive to the ocean and stare up at the stars
I like driving in my car

All around is anger
Automatic guns
Death in large numbers
And no respect for women or our little ones
I tried talking to Jesus
But he just put me on hold
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And he could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
When you've given up the drink
And those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early, at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up, I watch it as it sets
Yeah, this is as good as it gets

My, my, my it's a beautiful world
I like sleeping with Marie
She is one sexy girl full of mystery
She says she doesn't love me
But she likes my company
For now that's good enough for me

My, my, my it's a beautiful world

I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free (or a woman if you are one)
I like swimming in the sea

Perfect Situation,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/perfectsituation.html,"What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain.
There's the pitch, slow and straight.
All I have to do is swing
and I'm the hero, but I'm the zero.

Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable.
'Cause I could not have it better,
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto.
I just pass through...

singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.

Get your hands off the girl,
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company.
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander...
Can you blame her?

singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.

Tell me there's a logic out there.
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come.
Tell me there's some hope for me.
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth.

Rusted From the Rain,Billy Talent,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billytalent/rustedfromtherain.html,"I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There's nothing left to salvage, no-one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors, I don't look the same
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Dissect me 'til my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I'm nothing but a tin man, don't feel any pain
I don't feel any pain, I don't feel any pain,
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on... crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on... strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if... I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I'm just a frame
I used to be your lap dog, now I'm just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay,
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on... crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on... strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if... I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain,

And watch the fire as it slowly burns away

And we laugh till we cry 
Always so hard to say goodbye (good bye)

I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair),Sandi Thom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandithom/iwishiwasapunkrockerwithflowersinmyhair.html,"Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar,
Not everybody drove a car,
When music really mattered and when radio was king,
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop-stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
My mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs,
And playing games meant kick-arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair",2006

Slow Jam,New Order,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neworder/slowjam.html,"As I look at the morning sky
Today the wind is blowing hard
See that bird is floating high
Pretty soon it will be tired
I spent a day all by myself
A rich man without his wealth
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm not the only one

The afternoon was very clear
The sun was beating down on me
I got thirsty for a beer
That I had to go to sea
The sea was very rough
It made me feel sick
But I like that kind of stuff
It beats arithmetic

I don't want the world to change
I like the way it is
Just give me one more wish
I can't get enough of this
When it gets to be alive
And not just still survive
To hit and not to miss
I can't get enough of this

The early evening mists
Look beautiful to me
Was sweeter than a kiss
I wish you all could see
I'm a long long way from home
But this photograph of you
Even though it's monochrome
Tells me what I should do
So I got up on my feet
I knew it would be alright
For my clothes were looking beat
In the middle of the night

I don't want the world to change
I like the way it is
Just give me one more wish
I can't get enough of this
When it gets to be alive
And not just still survive
To hit and not to miss
I can't get enough of this

This Head I Hold,Electric Guest,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/electricguest/thisheadihold.html,"They call me a little grown up
See, I'm upset because I've always been stuck
But I don't know what it is I'm without
Guess I'm in love with always feeling down
(See the problem was I)
I was fully consumed
By all of the petty things that I couldn't do
All of the plastic, products, shows, and woes
But I didn't ever show, I let it go
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and

Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, oh, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be?
Make me say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be?
I'm feelin' so cold,
What they want, what they want from me
Make me say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (they want, they gonna be)

So find me stuck in some scene
I wanna get out but there's no in-between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that I've sunken so low
See the answer is this
If I wanna be free
I gotta stop playin' round and runnin' from me
'Cause all of the plastic, products, shows, and woes
They got my head feelin' low, no room to grow
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Don't feel, just go
If you listen carefully, then you won't feel so low

Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and
Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, no, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher

What's it gon', what's it gonna be?
Make me say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be?

What they want, what they want from me?

Get no sleep, meet the vampire
And I say, ooh, no, I go higher

Awake,Electric Guest,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/electricguest/awake.html,"Back to sin again, must be fate
The wait was all day
Black acts to amend at the gate
Awaiting to taste

Something perished past and gone away
And nothing ever lasts that hesitates

Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Back from holiday in my head
The ocean calling
Magic in the grave at the end
The old way falling

Something calling asking to create
The only other lasting love to make

Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

Cause there's something within
There is something within, I'm awake
All my friends
There's something between
Because something within, I'm awake
You're all my friends
Alone, enough, awake [repeat]

We've got a feeling of the day
Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way
Love is our only true escape
Fearing nothing washed away the weight away the weight

Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way",2012

Positively 4th Street,Bob Dylan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/positively4thstreet.html,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down you just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on the side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you? Good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand it's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is to see you",
Three Hours,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/threehours.html,"Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep 
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slave

Three hours from London
Jacomo's free
Taking his woes 
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known

Three hours from speaking
Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder
And three hours to fall

Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep 
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search for a master
In search for a slave",1969
Fruit Tree,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/fruittree.html,"Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish 
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
Till time has flown 
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show

Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
Till you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why
Safe in a womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light

Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know 
What you are really worth

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while 
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
Till time has flown far from their dying day

Fruit tree
Fruit tree
No one knows you but the rain and the air
Don't you worry
They'll stand and stare when you're gone

Fruit tree

Open your eyes to another year
They will know that you were here
when you are gone",1969

Le moral est bon. je poursuis le vol.
Tout va bien. L'engin fonctionne normalement.

Some People,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/somepeople.html,"Some people kill for less
Some people find it hard to get dressed
Some people, well
Ask how old I am

Some people live in a life
Some people need more than a slice
But when it fades
When the glitter's gone

You know it
You owe it to yourself
You won't let it make you mad
It's already crazy

Old and lonely when the shade is down
The brighter lights just smells their empty heads

Some people don't get much
Some people feel they're in touch
With spirit worlds, talking to you now

Some people just gotta say
Some people just wanna play
They get a kick when it's all messed up

You know it
You owe it to yourself
You won't let it make you mad
It's already crazy

You know it
You owe it to yourself
You won't let it make you mad
It's already crazy

I Was Made to Love Magic,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/iwasmadetolovemagic.html,"I was born to love no one
No one to love me
Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree.

I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago.

I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies.

I was made to love magic...

I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never.

I was made to love magic...",

Passenger Seat,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/passengerseat.html,"I roll the window down
And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

""do they collide?"" 
I ask and you smile.
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter.

When you feel embarrassed then i'll be your pride
When you need directions then i'll be the guide
For all time. 
For all time.",2003
Tiny Vessels,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/tinyvessels.html,"This is the moment that you know
That you told her that you loved her but you don't.
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.

I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave they left a mark

And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you'd ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I'd think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me",2003

Too Busy Thinking About My Baby,Marvin Gaye,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marvingaye/toobusythinkingaboutmybaby.html,"Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah... Oh listen to me people

Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly

And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow

Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else

Said, I ain't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Tellin ya I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell ya
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

Thoughts of Mary Jane,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/thoughtsofmaryjane.html,"Who can know
The thoughts of Mary jane
Why she flies
Or goes out in the rain
Where she's been
And who she's seen
In her journey to the stars.

Who can know
The reasons for her smile
What are her dreams
When they've journeyed for a mile
The way she sings
And her brightly coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky.

Who can know
What happens in her mind
Did she come from a strange world
And leave her mind behind
Her long lost sighs
And her brightly coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind.

Who can know
The thoughts of Mary Jane
Why she flies
Or goes out in the rain
Where she's been
And who she's seen
In her journey to the stars.",ompi
Time of No Reply,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/timeofnoreply.html,"Summer was gone and the heat died down
And Autumn reached for her golden crown
I looked behind as I heard a sigh
But this was the time of no reply.

The sun went down and the crowd went home
I was left by the roadside all alone
I turned to speak as they went by
But this was the time of no reply.

The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There is no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way.

The trees on the hill had nothing to say
They would keep their dreams till another day
So they stood and thought and wondered why
For this was the time of no reply.

Time goes by from year to year
And no one asks why I am standing here
But I have my answer as I look to the sky
This is the time of no reply.

The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There's no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way.",ompi

Home is where I want to be.
I've been on the road so long my friend,
And if you came along
I know you couldn't disagree.
It's the same old story
Everywhere I go,
I get slandered,
Libeled,
I hear words I never heard
In the Bible.
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine,
Two steps away from the county line,
Just trying to keep my customers
satisfied,
Satisfied.

Deputy Sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for, boy.
You better get your bags and flee.
You're in trouble boy,
And now you're heading into more.
It's the same old story
Everywhere I go,

Libeled,
I hear words I never heard
In the Bible.

She's Leaving Home,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/shesleavinghome.html,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband ""Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)

She's leaving home
Bye bye",1967
Wishful Thinking,Wilco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wilco/wishfulthinking.html,"Fill up your mind with all it can know 
Don't forget that your body will let it all go 
Fill up your mind with all it can know 
What would we be without wishful thinking 

Chambers of chains 
With red plastic mouths 
The inside of outside 
No one has found 
How to unring the bell 
It's just as well 

The turntable sizzles 
Casting the spells 
The pressure devices 
Hell in a nutshell 
Is any song worth singing 
If it doesn't help 

Fill up your mind with all it can know 
Don't forget that your body will let it all go 
Fill up your mind with all it can know 
'Cause what would love be without wishful thinking 

Open your arms as far as they will go 
We take off your dress 
An embarrassing poem 
Was written when I was alone 
In love with you 

I shook down those lines 
To shine up the streets 
I got up off my hands and knees 
To thank my lucky stars that you're not me 

What would we be without wishful thinking 
What would we be without wishful thinking 
What would we be without wishful thinking",2004

Philosophy,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/philosophy.html,"Won't you look up at the skyline
At the mortar, block, and glass
And check out the reflections in my eyes
See they always used to be there
Even when this was all was grass
And I sang and danced about a high-rise

And you were laughing at my helmet hat
Laughing at my torch

Go ahead and laugh all you want
I got my philosophy
And I trust it like the ground
That's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down

I see that there is evil
And I know that there is good
And the in-betweens I never understood
Would you look at me I'm crazy
But I get the job done
I'm crazy but I get the job done

So go ahead and laugh all you want
I got my philosophy
And I trust it like the ground
That's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down

I pushed you cause I loved you guys
I didn't realize
That you weren't having fun
And I dragged you up the stairs
And I told you to fly
You were flapping your arms
Then you started to cry, you were too high

Now you take this all for granted
You take the mortar, block, and glass
And you forget the speech that moved the stone
And it's really not that you can't see
The forest from the trees
You just never been out in the woods alone

So you can laugh all you want to
But I've got my philosophy
And I love you you're my friend
But you got no philosophy
Now it's time for this song to end",1995

Best Imitation of Myself,Ben Folds Five,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfoldsfive/bestimitationofmyself.html,"I feel like a quote out of context
Withholding the rest
So I can be free what you want to see
I got the gesture and sound
Got the timing down
It's uncanny, yeah, you think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent
Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck
I do the best imitation of myself

The ""problem with you"" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering, who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else, fool somebody else

Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
The best imitation of myself",1995

Drunk Girl,Something Corporate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/somethingcorporate/drunkgirl.html,"I kissed a drunk girl
I kissed a drunk girl, yes I did
Kissed a drunk girl on the lips
I let my guard down
how could I have been so dumb
Her eyes were open
I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else

I went to her house
and everybody there was gone
her little cousin just passed out on the lawn
We walked to my car 
She mouthed ""Is everything ok?"" 
We leaned in slowly 
So now I can say 

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else
anybody else

I pulled away
cuz you see I didn't think it would be
right I said let's save this
for some other night
She said ""No, no, no I know
That everything is gonna be just fine""
How could I do this when I want her to be all mine.

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
I'm sure I could've been anybody else
anybody else

I know you don't care about me
I'm sure when all is said and done
and I go home feeling lonely
You will have had your fun
do you even remember?

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself
I kissed a drunk girl
and now I'm sure
and now I'm sure
I could've been anybody else
anybody else
anybody else
I could have been
anybody else",2000

Leave, leave with the ones who don't, ooh

Nothing ever falls in place
The winter's are all wet
And you can't ever feel your face
You can't fucking feel your face

Hazey Jane I,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/hazeyjanei.html,"Do you curse where you come from,
Do you swear in the night
Will it mean much to you
If I treat you right.
Do you like what you're doing,
Would you do it some more
Or will you stop once and wonder
What you're doing it for.
Hey slow Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.
Hey slow Jane, live your lie
Slow, slow jane, fly on by.",1970
Assembly,Wild Beasts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildbeasts/assembly.html,"My tops off - I'm a goose pimpled god!
Upon my girth rests the earth, 
Gunna give it what I've got

The messed bottom bunked bed of the dead
This fouled fallen nest, 
This dried up drooping breast.
I hold my hips at this comic apocalypse,
The world's a whoopee wibbling wantlingly
On my crooked seat.

My tops off - I'm a goose pimpled god!
I'll quiver the jellies of every heavy and every bully that I might crossâ¦
Defunk the junk that saddens me on my telly
Let all the babies suckle bare bummed and comfy
Gullet without bullet (NO!)
Lab without rat (NO!)
Splat goes the council flat!
No criminal, no cooper, no court, no cage

My tops off - I'm a goose pimpled god!
Upon my girth rests the earth, 
Gunna give it what I've got

The messed bottom bunk bed of the dead
This fouled fallen nest, this dried up drooping breast
I curl like a cripp' at this gruesome gambit
The fit and the able scrap for crumbs beneath my limp legged table

My tops off - I'm a goose pimpled god!
I'll quiver the jellies of every heavy and every bully that I might crossâ¦
Defunk the junk that saddens me on my telly
Let all the babies suckle bare bummed and comfy
Gullet without bullet (NO!)
Lab without rat (NO!)
Splat goes the council flat!
No criminal, no cooper, no court, no cage

My tops off - I'm a goose pimpled god!
Upon my girth rests the earth I'm gunna give it what I've got
When all that is precious, all that love, is just a shoulder shrugged",

Did You See the Words,Animal Collective,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animalcollective/didyouseethewords.html,"Have you seen them? 
The words cut open your poor intestines 
Can't deny when the inky periods drip from your mailbox and blood flies dip and glide reach down
Inside
There's something living in these lines.

And when your newest kisser is peeking 
You dress yourself up tonight get all tangled up in arms and legs it's cramped up and someone grabs a hold do you go 
Ohhhhh
Should you go home? 
There's something starting don't know why.

And in a house so cozy few words are spoken 
Let's take our shoes off and unwind when there's minuets off in the background drowning out eyes off ears off test the kiss 
Goodnight
A kiss goodnight
Don't keep my loving on my mind.

Because it's messy, yes, this mess is mine
Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine

Look we've had similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns
Do the elderly couples still kiss and hug and grab their big wrinkly skin so tough wrinkly wrink wrink wrinkly roughâ¦?

Did you see the words you know?
(Give me rabies bring you babies at the hospital)
Violent ends with friends that go 
(I kissed a few in sticky shoes our cartoon show is broken)  
Doo, doo, doo, doo...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...",2005
Poor Boy,Nick Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickdrake/poorboy.html,"Never sing for my supper
I never help my neighbour
Never do what is proper
For my share of labour.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health

I Remember When,The Coral,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coral/irememberwhen.html,"I remember when I saw the sea freeze
But it said nothing of the birds and the bees
That were swarming around my head
Singing You'd be better off dead

But I ain't going down like that
No I ain't going down like that

Because I'm better than him
And I know where I've been
And I know where I'm comin' from
A lie is a sin, but don't we all sin
That is the truth, and the truth is grim
Now he's in jail and his story is for sale
The farmer's dog wags his crippled tail
It points to the West and leaves out the rest
And invites you to be his special guest

I remember when I saw the leaves fall
I was in the woods, in a gown you wouldn't wear to the ball
Into the ditch I fly wanted dead or alive

But I ain't going down like that
No I ain't going down like that",2002

A time and a place, for all of this loving war
Everyone buys, everyone's gotta price, and nothing is new

When will all the failures rise, rise!

What Do I Have to Do?,Stabbing Westward,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stabbingwestward/whatdoihavetodo.html,"You make it hard to breathe
It's as if I'm suffocating
And when you're next to me
I can feel your heartbeat through my skin
It makes me sad to think
This could all be for nothing
I wish there was a way
A way for you to see inside of me
I've never felt this way
About anyone or anything
Tell me
What do I have to do to make you happy?
What do I have to do to make you understand?
What do I have to do to make you want me?
And, if I can't make you want me
What do I have to do?

I know exactly what you're thinking
But I swear this time I will not let you down
I'm not as selfish as I used to be
That was a part of me that never made me proud
Right now I think I would try anything
Anything at all to keep you satisfied
God I hope you see what losing you would do to me
All I want is one more chance, tell me...
What do I have to do to make you happy
What do I have to do to make you understand?
What do I have to do to make you want me?
And, if I can't make you want me
Just tell me, tell me
What do I have to do to make you want me
What do I have to do to make you understand
What do I have to do to make you love me
If I can't make you love me just tell me, what do I have to do...

For our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain

Disintegration,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/disintegration.html,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is",1989

Just hang around awhile
Like to sit this silent moment out

Falling down on me
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say
That's gonna change the way I feel

Keep my hands off the wheel
'Cause there's nowhere else to go

Take some time
Just hang around awhile
Like to sit this silent moment out
I don't want to lose or let you down
Time's just gonna change itself around

Take this time
Just hang around awhile
Like to sit this silent moment out
I don't wanna lose or let you down
Time's just gonna change itself
Change itself around

I feel it's true
All alone without you
I feel it's true
'Cause you're running with the wind
And you're running with your life
Won't you come inside

Keep my hands off the wheel
'Cause there's nowhere else to go

Take some time
Just hang around awhile
Like to sit this silent moment out
I don't want to lose or let you down
Time's just gonna change itself around",2004
Hold On,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/holdon.html,"Say you to me
You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searchin' the land
For a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

Underneath, I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearin' me apart
Right from the very start
And now I see
That it don't take a trick of the light to excite me
So strong
So long
You'll see

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Simplicity
A heart of gold, an old head, and young shoulders
Quiet and lovely
Becomin' part of me
And now I see
From a handful of names and a thousand faces
One light, burnin', furiously

I was tired of January
I was tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I was tired of January
Tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I felt a change a-comin
I felt a change a-comin
felt a change a-comin, soon

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you
Been given lately

Oh, yes the world will turn if you're ready or not",2007
Barrowland Ballroom,Amy Macdonald,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amymacdonald/barrowlandballroom.html,"Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone.
Oh the girls in the Queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung.

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
through the Barrowland history
and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care it's
it's only me and you.
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
it's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you.
That people they may stop and stare but baby I, I just don't care
tonight, it's only me and you.

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band starts to play.
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on that stage

[Chorus]

And when the night turns to day
And the lights they fade away
I wish that life and love would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear.
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age.

I Don't Wanna Grow Up,Tom Waits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/idontwannagrowup.html,"When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up

Seems like folks turn into things
that they'd never want
The only thing to live for
Is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up


Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up",1992

for free rides and hits of pot

I wanna go, I wanna go
I wanna go to the carnival
But it cots $16 yeah
I wanna go to the carnival
But I know it costs $16 now

Round, round, round...
Gonna lose $20 while I'm there

Doesn't run anymore

And my friends are all useless lense
They don't see anymore
And all my chicks are all useless hens
They don't lay anymore

And my fists are plastic dice
They're the shape of the sun

Gone forever more

Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old
Old dirt road
Rambling rose
Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold",

And they all want you to change

All the sad faces drown

Bad things happen in the night 
Where we built another world 
Styles surround you here comes the night time 
Where we built another world 

Evening time 
I made a loud sound and shake some teeth 
Saw the lights pale across the street 
It's not gonna be just only a kiss 
Everyone's disguised just a little bit

In her room with her red fingernails
And a grip on the answers.

When it's home
And I'm broken, let's fix.
When it's home
And I'm swollen, let's kiss.
When it's home
And we're walking, she'll lead
If she's waiting, we'll leave.

If you drop it
It breaks.
If you hold it
It shakes.

Fire of Heaven/Altar of Earth,Matisyahu,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/fireofheavenaltarofearth.html,"[verse 1]
Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man-made
Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames
Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up
In your own domain
Fire crackers ohh and aah
But they never maintain

Fires burning
Flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides on an alter made from the ground

[chorus]
Fire descends on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on to Mount Zion
[repeat 2x]

[verse 2]
One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries but the other one sings
You walk around like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got, thank God for all that life brings
The poor man has it all but not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty but he's sitting like a king

[bridge]

[verse 3]
Backpack's getting heavy, moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders and lead around your waist
Making way, run in haste
There is no time to taste what you ate
WE should be grateful got a plateful
Fire burns like ice morsels falling fire like rain

D.J.S,Sublime,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sublime/djs.html,"All of the d.j.s surely have taken a lesson

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right

I am the one with d.j. with enough flavor
Hear the dub and say lord have his grilled cheese.
I ain't Jamaican, but I ain't no freak
Caught the man eno with the one pound bag o' tweak
And called him ghost rider everytime you see him he fulfill the danger

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
Dred gotta a job to do and he might fulfill his mission
To see his pain would be his greatest ambition
We will survive in this world of competition

In keeping with, the universe all upside down. Twice, twice, twice.
And broken legs and arms in slings, 
You cry secretly. You won't wear my diamond rings. Why? Why? Why?

And millionaires have bought this town and changed everything.

Heard codes in the melodies
You heeded the call
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use em all

Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest you could just accrue it all

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming",2010
You Know How I Do,Taking Back Sunday,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/takingbacksunday/youknowhowido.html,"So sick, so sick of being tired.
And oh so tired of being sick.
We're both such magnificent liars.
So crush me baby, I'm all ears.
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious.
I'll give in one more time and feed you stupid lines all about ""cleaning up my act...""

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.

So sick, so sick of being tired.
And oh so tired of being sick.
Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about.
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious.
So good at setting bad examples.
Listen, trick, I've had all I can handle.

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore.

Think of all the fun you had.
(We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore)
The finest line divides a night well spent from a waste of time.
(We won't stand for)
Think of all the days you spent alone with just your T.V. set and I
(We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore)
I can barely smile
(We won't stand for)

Monster Love,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/monsterlove.html,"I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come
The folly of a monster love like you

Grey is good
The light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town

I save the part
The sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
But I know a papermoon
The folly of a monster love like you

The pavement smell just after rain
The sun leaps out, it's clear again
I told you how I felt the earth could move
The folly of a monster love like you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end...",2008

Oh yeah!
Its the music that we choose [x4]

The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a mild groove on

Day do, dah bop [x4]

There you go!
Get the cool!
na na na na na na na
Get the cool shoeshine! [x4]

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail

And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keepin, my groove on

Day do, dah bop [x4]

There you go!

Get the cool shoeshine! [x4]

Mama,Spice Girls,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/spicegirls/mama.html,"She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood mama
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Chemo Limo,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/chemolimo.html,"I had a dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said if you don't want to do it
then you don't have to do it
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then in my dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway
And I smiled cause I'd known it all the while.

I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine

I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo

it's making me tired

And I'm gonna go out in style
go out in style
This shit it's making me tired
it's making me tired
it's making me tired
But mama's gonna go out in style, go out in style

When I woke up
My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company

Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in

The doctor he asked which way we were headed
I said, Sir, let's just go west and he listened obediently,
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
with her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

Plenty of Paper,Eisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eisley/plentyofpaper.html,"Something's growing under that wing
I think a face is dawning
Oh no the books are growing faces
And you're lost quite classically
With your nose in a book
And it seems so fitting
And perhaps this is the end we've sought after for so long
And perhaps now it's done

Cause we've found all the dire dreams of men and machines
And turned them all around our identical hands
Composing our commands
I cut the moon in half
And stuck a piece to my hair
It made the back of my head glow
Golden yellow and then I took
Ten stars on sticks and placed them in my small metal
Bucket and I gave the other half of the moon to you
Ooh, so you wouldn't forget me while I'm gone

Cause we found all the dire dreams of men and machines and
Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves
Our paperback books, our charming looks
Our identical hands
Composing our commands
And oh my love
We can live on the sun
And wouldn't we be attractive
Riding in our shiny motor cars
With eyeglasses full of stars
And plenty of paper for scenery paintings

'cause we found all the dire dreams of men and machines and
Turned them all around to
Enjoy them and benefit ourselves
Our paperback books, our charming looks
Our identical hands
Composing our commands",2005
Innocent,Our Lady Peace,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ourladypeace/innocent.html,"Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous
Spends his time alone 
In the basement
With Lennon and Cobain
A guitar and a stereo
While he wishes he 
Could escape this
It all seems so contagious
Not to be yourself and faceless
In a song that has no soul

I remember feeling low
I remember losing hope
I remember all the feelings
And the day they stopped
We are, 
We are all innocent, we are all innocent
We are, we are, we are
We are all innocent, we are all innocent

Oh, Tinaâs losing faith in what she knows
Hates her music 
Hates all of her clothes
Thinks of surgery
And a new nose
Every calorie is a war
While she wishes she 
Was a dancer
And that she'd never 
Heard of cancer
She wishes God would give her
Some answers
And make her feel beautiful

One day
You'll have to let it go,
Oh
One day 
You'll stand up on your own, you'll stand up on your own

Remember feeling low, 
Remember all the feelings and the day they stopped

May This Be Love,Jimi Hendrix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/maythisbelove.html,"Waterfall, nothing can harm me at all,
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall.

I can see my rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall.

Some people say day-dreaming's
For all the, huh, lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do.

So let them laugh, laugh at me,
So just as long as I have you
To see me through,
I have nothing to lose 'long as I have you.

Waterfall, don't ever change your ways.
Fall with me for a million days,
Oh, my waterfall.",1967

Half the things I've planned
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Haven't had the half of mind to stay
And start to take a stand
Haven't held on half as long as I had hoped
As I had hoped to plan

Happiness, half the shit they said I had
In half didn't have a chance
You don't have to be so cruel

So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering

So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

By love we'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know 
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside

That's when I spend the most time
Thinking 'bout what I've given up
This is a warning
When you start the day just to close the curtains
You're thinking 'bout what I've given up

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I rearrange the songs again
This mix could burn a hole in anyone
But it was you I was thinking of

I read your letter
The one you left when you broke into my house
Retracing every step you made
And you said you meant it
And there's a piece of me in every single
Second of every single day
But if it's true then tell me how it got this way

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I rearrange the songs again
This mix could burn a hole in anyone

And I can't get to you
I can't get to you
I can't get to you (you, you)

Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I conduct a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I'm cutting through you track by track
I swear to God this mix could sink the sun
But it was you I was thinking of

And where are you now?
And where are you now?

And this is my mixed tape for her
It's like I wrote every note
With my own fingers",2005

Check it out Iâm rocking steady
Go!

Betty wonât stop listening to modern rock
How she hates to be alone
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine she says hey
I rock the Haro sport
I rock the cow girl blues
I rock too fast for love Iâm footloose in my Velcro shoes
Whatâs up with Will and Grace?
I donât get drum and bass
The future freaks me out

Iâm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out Iâm rocking steady

Iâd rather waste our time together
Yeah, âcause we can get down

Betty canât quit carving question marks in my wrist
How come weâre so alone
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
From an era we hate to admit we embrace
We fail to represent
We fail to be content
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt

To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone

Betty itâs so hard to relate
To the whole human race
I donât know where to begin
I donât know where to begin
If we can both find a way
To do the things that we say
We might not sit in our rooms
And drink our daydreams away
Betty, Iâm a dreamer
Iâm not a vicious schemer
Oh Betty wonât you.. ah fuck it 

Iâm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out Iâm rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh-oh-oh
I know that sheâs the only one
Iâd rather waste our time together
Yeah, âcause we can get down.",2003
(The Symphony of) Blasé,Anberlin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anberlin/thesymphonyofblas.html,"Are there no shadows where you are?
I can see everything as day
Problems that you try to hide away
Pushing me aside (You're pushing me aside)

Could the winter calm come twice?
Because your heart seems so cold tonight
Thirst for substance somehow isn't right
It's killing me inside (It's killing you inside)
Killing me inside

I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be here even now
I don't wanna be by your side
If something isn't right
If something isn't right

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
Words have no meaning
When I've seen where you've been

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
This is our last goodbye
This is where love ends

Are you so naive to right and wrong
How could you watch innocence forgone
Does what we've done ever really belong?
It wasted me away (I feel so wasted away)

God if you can hear me out alright
Please take these feelings for her inside
My chest hurts when I breathe tonight
It's wasting me away (You're wasting me away)
You're wasting me away

I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be here even now
I don't wanna be by your side
If something isn't right
If something isn't right

This is our last (This is our last)

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
Words have no meaning
When I've seen where you've been

This our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
This is our goodbye
This is where love ends

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
Words have no meaning
When I've seen where you've been

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
This is our last goodbye
This is where love ends",2005
The House of the Rising Sun,Nina Simone,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ninasimone/thehouseoftherisingsun.html,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm one

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

Now, my mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a drunken man needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Lord, is when he's on the drunk

Somebody go get my baby sister
Tell her to do, not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Well, I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Yes, I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, the rising sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm one

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray",1967

I Was Born to Love You,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/iwasborntoloveyou.html,"I was born to love you

Every single day...

Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feeling
Comin' through

I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you

We've Been Had,The Walkmen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/walkmen/wevebeenhad.html,"Well I'm a modern guy I don't care much for the go-go 
or the retro image I see so often telling me to 
keep trying maybe you'll get here someday 
keep up the working, ok
I close the book on them right there 

I see myself change as the days change over 
I hear the songs and the words don't change 
I write them out of the book right there

We've been had, you say it's over 
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older 
We've been had I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud 

See me age 19 with some dumb haircut from 
1960 moving to New York City 
live with my friends there we're all taking the same steps
they're foolish now 

We've been had you say it's over 
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older 
We've been had I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud",2002
Share Your Love with Me,Aretha Franklin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arethafranklin/shareyourlovewithme.html,"It's an evil wind

And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate

Outside the restaurant one day

Buried A Lie,Senses Fail,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sensesfail/buriedalie.html,"Rest in peace girl, your death is such a shame
The paper said a bullet got in your way
But I smell foul play, possible poisoning
I had to bring you in for questioning
I went to your grave, dug up your body
Brought it to my house, where you lay

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
For me...

I headed downtown, to share what I had found
It's not a suicide, it's a crime
I have a witness, it's clearly evident
There had to be someone else present
At the time of death, poisons in stomach
How could she pull it, if she's dead?

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
We've got to hurry up
Before the flesh decays
Away...away

I'll catch the murderer
And send him away
I'll get the evidence
From your last day

Your last day...[x3]

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made

Creatures (For a While),311,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/311/creaturesforawhile.html,"My name is volatile
I've been this way a long while
I'd surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It's been a wild ride
I wouldn't change a minute
I can't slow down inside
Guess that's why I live it

The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth's hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown

I'm not used to it, you'd think I'd be by now
The ins the outs the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you we're gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You're lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display

It's something one won't understand
Unless they're in it with me hand and hand

Don't buy the fear don't buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn
Even if you're coming down

Sometimes it's wearable sometimes is bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is full

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creatures

It comes and goes and comes and goes
Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you

I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do",2003
Academia,Sia,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sia/academia.html,"You can be my alphabet and I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator
I will time you as you run up to down
And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town

The mean of our heights is divided by the nights
Which is times'd by the daggers and the root of all our fights,
The pass of your poem just to swathe me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I am a dash and you are a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote

I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over-analysed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am ""Needing of your love""

Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

Howl,Florence + the Machine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florencethemachine/howl.html,"If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in but now it seems you've set it running free
Screaming in the dark, I howl when we're apart
Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart

My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to howl
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to

Howl, howl
Howl, howl

Now there's no holding back, I'm making to attack
My blood is singing with your voice, I want to pour it out
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground

Like some child possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you tear out all your tenderness

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters, hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters, hunters

The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground

And howl, and howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters
A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in but now it seems you've set it running free
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground",2009
