First Day of My Life,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/firstdayofmylife.html,"This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain
Suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,
But now I don't care
I could go anywhere
With you and I'd probably be happy.""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me",2005
Saint Simon,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/saintsimon.html,"After all these implements and text designed by intellects
So vexed to find evidently there's just so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night

Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside

There's no measuring of it
As nothing else is love

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night...

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing really holds a candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you",2003
Soul Meets Body,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/soulmeetsbody.html,"I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel, feel what its like to be new

Cause in my head thereâs a greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
where theyâre far more suited than here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one anotherâs
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe itâs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause youâre the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

And I do believe itâs true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause youâre the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere",2005
I Believe in a Thing Called Love,The Darkness,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/darkness/ibelieveinathingcalledlove.html,"Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel

Touching you, touching me
touching you, god you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!

Touching you, touching me
touching you, god you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh! Guitar!

Good People,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/goodpeople.html,"You win
It's your show, now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people
Will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see?
Before we lose touch of
We thought this was low
Well, it's bad, getting worse, so

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one two,
Man, what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused,
Got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now whose side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting 'round feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
'Cause it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your reasons
It's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Where'd all the good people go?

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one, two
Now what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused, give me some truth
You got too much to lose
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Whose side are we on today, anyway?
OK, whatever you say.
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone.",2005

Anyone Else But You,The Moldy Peaches,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moldypeaches/anyoneelsebutyou.html,"You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
Kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swingin' from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So, why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3, DVD, rumble-pack guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, ""b"", ""a"", start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

You are always tryin' to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

We both have shiny, happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan!
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Squinched up your face and did a dance
Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Mamma Mia,ABBA,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/abba/mammamia.html,"I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end

There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

Bye bye, leave me now or never

Bye bye doesn't mean forever

Breakfast at Tiffany's,Deep Blue Something,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deepbluesomething/breakfastattiffanys.html,"You'll say, we've got nothin' in common

I guess I was wrong
So what now?  
It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

Do The Whirlwind,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/dothewhirlwind.html,"She said you'd given up, 
Your folks told me you should be left alone, 
on a mountain top 
knocking the aeroplanes down with stones. 

Do the whirlwind 
and carry the hope that stings all night long, 
Don't abandon him 
'cause he quivers when he hears your song.

Believe me, it's safe to see,
At least be confused about right and wrong, 
Plan to settle down, 
Over the moon under the sun. 

Do the whirlwind, 
and shotgun the seat that beats (beats) 
Hanging on to the one you love 
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on. 

Folks given up under the quivers and lines, 
You do the whirlwind, 
Don't abandon, 
Get a handle of yourself, son

Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest?

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",ompi

Call the investigator, the heart investigator",2007

Loose Lips,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/looselips.html,"Loose lips might sink ships but loose kisses take trips
To San Francisco, double dutch disco,
Tech TV hottie, do it for Scotty
Do it for the living and do it for the dead
Do it for the monsters under your bed
Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom
Broken hearts hurt but they make us strong and

We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We're just dancing, we're just hugging,
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
On the sleeve of how it used to be
How's it gonna be?
I'll drop kick russell stover, move into the starting over house
And know matt rouse and jest are watching me achieve my dreams

And we'll pray, all damn day, every day,
That all this shit our president has got us in will go away
While we strive to figure out a way we can survive
These trying times without losing our minds

So if you wanna burn yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
And if you wanna cut yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
And if you wanna kill yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
Call me up before you're dead, we can make some plans instead
Send me an IM, I'll be your friend

Shysters live from scheme to scheme but my 4th quarter pipe dreams
Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation
And I'll say FUCK BUSH AND FUCK THIS WAR
My war paint is sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
They think we're disposable, well both my thumbs opposable
Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score

And we won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened

We're just dancing, we're just hugging,
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
On the sleeve of how it used to be",2006

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know

I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl

That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know

True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip

Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs,
Surprises, let me know she cares

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,

I'll be your thrill,
The night will go on,
My little windmill

Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Keep your head still,

My Interpretation,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/myinterpretation.html,"You talk about life, you talk about death
And everything in between
Like it's nothing, and the words are easy
You talk about me, and you talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's something, that needs repeating
I don't need an alibi oh for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
You toss me up and down
It doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?
If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

It's really not such a sacrifice

If I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

And it don't have to make no sense to you at all
'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah",2007

I used to buy my faith in worship

I used to worry about the future
But then I throw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be care free
No no no, until I took a trip to the other side of town
Yeah yeah yeah, you know I heard that boogie rhythm

I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent, hey hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do

Stuck between hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through

Two Doors Down,Mystery Jets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mysteryjets/twodoorsdown.html,"I think I'm in love,
With the girl next door
It's driving me crazy
I can't take it any more
I hear her playing the drums late at night
The neighbours complain but that's the kind of girl I like

And maybe I should call her up
And buy her a round
Maybe I should move to another town
But when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives

I think I'm in love

She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
To a worn out 12"" of Marquee Moon

And maybe I should say ""What's up?""
And buy her a round
Or take her for a spin around the town
Cos when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives
Two doors down

Get Lost,Patrick Wolf,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/patrickwolf/getlost.html,"Lets go 
Lets go my love 

We could go to the cinema 
Big effects and big named stars 
And we can go to that private view 
But darling these days my favorite view is you 
Lets just bend the invitation 
And leave our bikes down at the station 
Lose our sense of direction 
There's nothing here to lose 

Oh you will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly 
You're my love 
So come away with me 
Lets get lost till empty 

We could stay here till closing time 
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime 
We could dance till our feet turn red 

But the beats so boring 
And I'd rather be home in our bed 

This towns skipping like a record 
Reruns get me so bored 
So with enough that I can afford 
Lets get lost 
Again 

Yeah we will run 
Come get lost with me 
Slip away discreetly 
You're my love 
Come get lost with me 
Till we run on empty 

Lets go 
Lets go 
You're my love come get lost with me 
You're my love come till empty 
Lets go",2007
Wonderwall,Oasis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/wonderwall.html,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Where it goes, you'll know

Iron out the creases
Pick up the pieces
Wherever they may fall

If you take it for its flaw
Don't expect too much for what you want
Diamonds in the rough, I'll keep
The devil wants to make a deal
But you should take to heart
The sound of life

Love Song,Sara Bareilles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarabareilles/lovesong.html,"Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today, today

I learned the hard way
That they all say things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me, you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight my guide gone
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this

Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

To write you a love song today, today",2007

You'll never wait so long

Big shake to the land that's falling down

Woah woah. Woah woah

Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner cafÃ©
And then i'm left in bits recovering tectonic tremblings

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing
Got lucky, beautiful shot you taking everything off watch the curtains wide open
Then you fall in the same routine flicking through the TV relaxed and reclining
And you think you're alone...

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well

We'll have drinks and talk about things, any excuse to stay awake with you
You'll sleep here, i'll sleep there, but then the heating may be down again
at my convenience
we'd be good, we'd be great together.

Wonderful World,James Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmorrison/wonderfulworld.html,"I've been down so low
People look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong

Staring through a window
Standing outside, they're just too happy to care tonight
I want to be like them
But I'll mess it up again

I tripped on my way in
And got kicked outside, everybody saw...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love
It just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything
I'd never, never, ever let you feel alone
I won't I won't leave you, on your own

But who am I to dream?
Dreams are for fools, they let you down...

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me, or maybe just a little letter
Oh, we could start again

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well 
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I know that it's a wonderful world
I can't feel it right now
I got all the right clothes to wear
I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

And I know that it's a wonderful world
When you're with me",2006
Smiley Faces,Gnarls Barkley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gnarlsbarkley/smileyfaces.html,"[Verse]
What did you do? What did you say?
Did you walk - or did you run away?
Where are you now? Where have you been?
Did you go alone - or did you bring a friend?

[Hook #1]
I need to know this - cause I notice when you're smilin'
Out in the sun havin' fun and you're feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me

[Verse]
What went right? What went wrong?
Was it the story - or was it the song?
Was it overnight - or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

[Hook #2]
Or all the above - oh how I love to see you smilin'
And oh yeah - take a little pain just in case
You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smilin' face
Hey, put on a smilin' face

[Bridge]
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

[Hook #3]
I want to be you - whenever I see you smilin'
Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face",2006
Have a Nice Day,Stereophonics,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stereophonics/haveaniceday.html,"San Francisco Bay
Past pier thirty nine
Early p.m.
Can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab
Stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of
But it turned out just right

It started straight off
""Coming here is hell""
That's his first words
We asked what he meant
He said "" where ya' from?""
We told him our lot
""When ya' take a holiday
Is this what you want?""

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day
Have a drink to chase
""Yourself and tourists, yeah
That's what I hate""
He said ""We're going wrong
We've all become the same
We dress the same ways
Only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Swim in the ocean
That be my dish
I drive around all day
And kill processed fish
It's all money gum
No artists anymore
You're only in it now
To make more, more, more

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day",2001

When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you

Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other

Hold your hand out you silly girl see what you've done

Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you

Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),Garbage,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garbage/cherrylipsgobabygo.html,"She gave you everything she had 
But she was young and dumb 
She'd just turned 21 
She didn't care to hang around 
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found 
This life can turn a good girl bad 
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

With your cherry lips and golden curls 
You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past 
And in your hot pants and high heels 
They could not believe that such a body was for real 
It seemed like rainbows would appear 
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear 
Because you looked just like a girl 
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast 

You're so such a delicate boy 
In the hysterical realm 
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms 

You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts 
You make the whole world wanna dance 
You bought yourself a second chance 

Go baby go go 
We're right behind you 
Go baby go go 
Yeah, we're looking at you 
Go baby go go

You bought yourself a second chance

Maxwell's Silver Hammer,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/maxwellssilverhammer.html,"Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so"" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

Zak And Sara,Ben Folds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/zakandsara.html,"Sara spelled without an 'h' was getting bored
On a Peavea amp in 1984

Playing Sara-with-no-h's favourite song

(La da da da, la da da, la da da)
(La da da da, la da da, la da da) 

Zak and Sara

Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Because at home they got her smacked

(La da da da, la da da, la da da)
(La da da da, la da da, la da da) 

Zak and Sara
Zak and Sara

Zak called his dad about layaway plans
And Sara told the friendly salesman that:
""You'll all die in your cars,
And why's it gotta be dark?
And you're all working in a submarine""

(Asshole) 

She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped

I'm gonna make it mine

Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away

And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you

Well I don't wanna break before

Yes I... I'll own it
I'm gonna make it mine

And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting

Well I don't wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world

Oh yes I'm following your joy
I'm gonna make it mine

Foundations,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/foundations.html,"Thursday night,
Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eye,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say.
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends.

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoyin'
And say something like
""Yeah, intelligent input darlin'. Why don't you just have another beer then?""

Then you'll call me a ""bitch"" and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

You said I must eat so many lemons,
'Cause I am so bitter.
I said, ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate,
'Cause they are much fitter.""

Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget,
But I can't.

Your face is pasty,
'Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
'Cause it's making me sick.

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these yesterday.
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this.

Well I'll leave you there 'til the mornin',
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one.

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't.
And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget
But I can't.

And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile.
I know I should forget
But I can't.

And every time we fight
I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile.
I know I should forget
But I can't.",2007
Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/meandjuliodownbytheschoolyard.html,"The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out he, began to shout
And he started the investigation

It's against the law
It was against the law
What mama saw
It was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, ""Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna put him in the house of detention""

Well, I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Good-bye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they come and
Take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest
Come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

And I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Good-bye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard",1972
Do You Remember,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/doyouremember.html,"Do you remember when we first met? I sure do.
It was some time in early September
But you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find â you painted flowers on it
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon.

Well, I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all,
Over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine,
We're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You'd play me boogie woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are.

We built our get away up in a tree we found.
We felt so far away, but we were still in town.
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at.

Well, all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind,
We're locked in time
But you're still mine

Do you remember?",2005
Sir Duke,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/sirduke.html,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over - all over now people

Can't you feel it all over
Come on let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody - all over people",1976

Happy Phantom,Tori Amos,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toriamos/happyphantom.html,"And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch
Oh who
The time is getting closer
Oh who
Time to be a ghost
Oh who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we been?

So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin

Oh who
The time is getting closer
Oh who
Time to be a ghost
Oh who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been, yeah?

Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see

Oh who
The time is getting closer
Oh who
Time to be a ghost
Oh who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we been?

And if I die today [3x]
I-I'm chasing nuns out in the yard",1992
Good Morning Good Morning,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/goodmorninggoodmorning.html,"Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neutralmilkhotel/intheaeroplaneoverthesea.html,"What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Oh how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all",1998

you ought to know what brings me here
you glide through my head blind to fear
and I know why

don't give up your independence
unless it feels so right
nothing good comes easily
sometimes you gotta fight

Sweet Home Alabama,Lynyrd Skynyrd,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lynyrdskynyrd/sweethomealabama.html,"Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor (boo, boo, boo)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Oh sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue

Solsbury Hill,Peter Gabriel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petergabriel/solsburyhill.html,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
(I) just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said ""Grab your things,
I've come to take you home.""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
""Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" he said ""Grab your things
I've come to take you home.""
(Back home.)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said ""You can keep my things,
they've come to take me home.""",1977
Your Song,Elton John,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/yoursong.html,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

We're all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California

We watched the sunset from my car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah

And if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

There's nowhere else to go

We've been singing Billie Jean
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
We've got strangers stopping by
And though you're out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And all I'll say is I don't wanna say good night

There's no quiet corner
To get to know each other
And there's no hurry
I'm a patient man as you'll discover

Cause if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you

We'll share the shelter of my single bed
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
And it goes

If this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning's on it's way
Our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go
I hope that you'll stay the night

If this is what we've got

One Week,Barenaked Ladies,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barenakedladies/oneweek.html,"It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me saying
""Get back together come back and save me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
'Cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
That vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air
And said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault
Not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set a' better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides
And said, ""I'm sorry.""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me
Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

The Owls Go,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/theowlsgo.html,"(Four, three, two, one)

Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground
How 'bout the tree back your house where the owls go
Or in between the attic and the basement
Somewhere it's not dark, dark, dark, dark

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
And don't go finding a replacement,
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart

Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that that it feels like it is ending

(Four, three, two, one)

Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you

And you shout out loud
And you're bursting with pride
'Cause they don't let you talk
And your heart is finally mending

It's not too late now to change your mind
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line

An attic in a basement
Attic in a basement

And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that it feels like it is ending
It shouldn't feel like it is ending",2003
I'm Like a Bird,Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/imlikeabird.html,"You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is 
(and baby all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

[Chorus]

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
Each and every single day I know 
I'm going to have to eventually give you away
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey I'm just scared
That we may fall through

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.,Noah and the Whale,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/noahandthewhale/lifegoeson.html,"Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes
That've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Loney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone

From the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said:

You've got heart and you're going your own way

What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home

Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

From the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say:

You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way

You've got heart and you're going your own way

[Bridge]
On my last night on earth, I want to look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

[Chorus]

Tire Swing,Kimya Dawson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kimyadawson/tireswing.html,"I took the Polaroid down in my room.
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend.
It's not as if I don't like you.
It just makes me sad whenever I see it.

'Cause I like to be gone most of the time,
And you like to be home most of the time.
If I stay in one place I lose my mind.
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride,
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason.
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan.
Paul Baribeau took me to the giant tire swing,
Gave me a push and he started singing.
I sang along while I was swinging.
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.

Now I'm home for less than 24 hours.
That's hardly time to take a shower.
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall.
Check my e-mail, write a song and make a few phone calls.

Before it's time to leave again
I got one hand on the steering wheel, one waving out the window.
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My yarns will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights.

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride.
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like.
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended.
And even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended.",2006
Fighting in a Sack,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/fightinginasack.html,"Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
And had it nailed to my forehead again 
To keep this boat afloat 
There are things you can't afford to know 
So I save all my breath for the sails. 

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Walking a bridge with weakening cables 
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through. 

Most ideas turn to dust 
As there are few in which we all can trust 
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mind? 
So let's abandon that track 
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack 
Cause we are way too wise-assed for that. 

You might find some fools at your doorstep 
Hustling the latest changes to the book 
That's the strangest in an attempt to multiply 
Marionettes on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate 
Because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through. 

We've taken on a climb 
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs 
Walking up a slide 
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track.

But you'll find those lingering voices 
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice 
And make a moron out of you 
Crossing the brindge on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate 
And it's a lot to put us through",2003

Wishbone,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/wishbone.html,"Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away (Romantic)

Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?

Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cuz I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)

Tambourine style, walking in a single file
You whisper half thoughts to me

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?",2005

On the Wing,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/onthewing.html,"Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone? 

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades

Don't you love in vain
'Cause love won't set you free

I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
'Cause I'm just tryna be happy, yeah
Just wanna be happy, yeah

Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just tryna play my role
Slowly disappear, oh

But all these days,
They feel like they're the same
Just different faces, different names
Get me out of here

Well, I can't stand by the side, oh, no,
And watch this life pass me by, pass me by

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me

So many turns that I can't see,
Like I'm a stranger on this road

Don't say anything

My baby don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me

Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
My baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

[Original lyrics]

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
is somethin' he can't see

My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for
he don't care for high-tone places

I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
Just says his prayers for
My baby just cares for me",1958
Sultans of Swing,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/sultansofswing.html,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south London town

You check out guitar, George
He knows all the chords
Mind it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band
It ain't what they call ""Rock 'n' Roll""
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole, Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home.""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing,
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing.""",1978
All These Things That I've Done,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/allthesethingsthativedone.html,"When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on
Hold on

I wanna stand up
I wanna let go
You know, you know
No you don't, you don't

I wanna shine on in the hearts of men
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand

Another head aches
Another heart breaks
I'm so much older
Than I can take

And my affection
Well it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection
No no no no

Help me out
You know you gotta help me out
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out

And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be

You know you gotta help me out
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out

You're gonna bring yourself down
You're gonna bring yourself down
You're gonna bring yourself down

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

Time, truth, hearts

You know you gotta help me out
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out
You're gonna bring yourself down

You're gonna bring yourself down
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down
You're gonna bring yourself down

Over and in
Last call for sin
While everyone's lost
The battle is won
With all these things that I've done

All these things that I've done
Time, truth, hearts
If you can hold on
If you can hold on",2004
The Sound of Settling,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/thesoundofsettling.html,"I've got a hunger
Twisting my stomach into knots
That my tongue was tied off

My brain's repeating
""if you've got an impulse let it out""
But they never make it past my mouth.

Baa bah, this is the sound of settling
Baa bah, baa bah
[x2]

Our youth is fleeting
Old age is just around the bend
And i can't wait to go grey

And i'll sit and wonder
Of every love that could've been
If i'd only thought of something charming to say.

Baa bah, this is the sound of settling
Baa bah, baa bah

Close to Me,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/closetome.html,"I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought that this day would end
I never thought that tonight could ever be
This close to me

Just try to see in the dark
Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out
Hold my breath
And wait until I shake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought that this day would end
I never thought that tonight could ever be
This close to me

But if I had your face
I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door
Was a dream",1985

Crazy,Gnarls Barkley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gnarlsbarkley/crazy.html,"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.

In so much space

And when you're out there
Without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly [radio version]
probably [album version]

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

When you fall everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold

Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold

Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along

When everything is wrong, we move along

Move along, move along like I know you do

Move along, move along just to make it through

Down Under,Men at Work,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/menatwork/downunder.html,"Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

""Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover.""

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover."" (yeah)

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty.""
And he said:

""Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover.""",1981

All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky

I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind

The Underdog,Spoon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/spoon/theunderdog.html,"Picture yourself in the living room
Your pipe and slippers set out for you
I know you think that it ain't too far

But I hear the call of a lifetime ring
Felt the need to get up for it
Oh you cut out the middleman
Get free from the middleman

You got no time for the messenger,
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive!

I want to forget how conviction fits
But can I get out from under it?
Can I gut it out of me?
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
Can't let go of it,

Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,
You will not back up an inch ever,
That's why you will not survive,

The thing that I tell you now
It may not go over well
And it may not be photo-op
In the way that I spell it out

But you won't hear from the messenger,
Don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive! (Hey!)",2007

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

Playful as a pussy cat

Temporarily out of gas

Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

What I feel, I can't say
But my love is there for you any time of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side
Oh tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

What is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

Oh tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me who am I without you by my side",1970
Crocodile Rock,Elton John,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/crocodilerock.html,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called ""The Crocodile Rock""
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called ""The Crocodile Rock""
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight",1973
Soak Up the Sun,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/soakupthesun.html,"My friend the communist 
Holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital
I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
I'm the one who has the key
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too 

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
I got my 45 on
So I can rock on",2002

There's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah

And I can tell I'm her kind of guy

Little Secrets,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/littlesecrets.html,"When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
(higher, higher, higher, higher...)

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colours of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)

Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling

Sweet Disposition,The Temper Trap,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tempertrap/sweetdisposition.html,"Sweet disposition
Never too soon

Like no one's watching you

A moment, a love
a dream, a laugh
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
a dream, a laugh
A moment, a love
a dream, a laugh

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs

Stay there

Happy?,Mudvayne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mudvayne/happy.html,"In this hole

The dead are rolling over
In this hole
Thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me
So overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned
Unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
That is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Are you
HAPPY?

Are you
HAPPY?

Are you feeling happy?

In this hole
That is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release??
What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from myself

She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit fooling around""

Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love",2010

Isn't She Lovely,Stevie Wonder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/isntshelovely.html,"Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love",1976
The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy),Simon & Garfunkel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/simongarfunkel/the59thstreetbridgesongfeelingroovy.html,"Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy

Hello, lamppost, what'cha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't'cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy

I got no deeds to do
No promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy",1966
My Slumbering Heart,Rilo Kiley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rilokiley/myslumberingheart.html,"In my dreams, i see myself hitting a baseball
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
I'm all tan and smiling and running from third base
It's hot and the kids keep on playing the driving game
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
And the sky is a bluish gray

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone

In my dreams, i see you at the foot of some mountains
And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
It's late and the sun keeps shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up

I've become just like a terrible mess
Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
But the crowds keep me coming back
Cheering

In my dreams, i see you asleep in a twin bed
The covers pulled up over your head
Am i asleep or awake?
It's morning and the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am i asleep or awake?

It just feels good when we're waking up
It just feels good when you're next to me
It just feels good when you're coming home
It just feels good when it's waking up
My slumbering heart

It's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone
I'm not a failure i swear
I wish you could see it from over there
I've got a lot over here without you
I've barely been gone

Ooh yeah, uh huh, yeah

I want to dance

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

With somebody who loves me

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody who

Somebody who loves me

Sing Songs Along,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/singsongsalong.html,"we'll wake up your mothers, we'll start a commotion
we'll take you apart, we'll swallow the ocean
and just when you've labeled us one of your types 
we'll fly our flag right up up out of your sky
so puff out your chest in some weird dusty fight
we're taking no part in your cracked antique life
we're believing everything that we have heard
we're taking our turn with the kids that don't learn
you know I'm going to take my turn
let us be free, let us sing songs along
the bottoms of barrels , let us be free
so out come you clowns, all you wolves, all you martyrs
you holy rat rattlers, holy found fathers
we're selling ourselves so ourselves can find
we're living at night trying to pull out the light
we'll turn up the heat as we burn up you boxes
we'll loosen our wrists as we fill in your foxholes
you've got your bad apples to ruin your bunch
yeah we're all right here so you better eat up
oh yeah, there's nothing you can do
if you want me here, you can have me here
if you want me now, you can have me now
if you want me down, I will get really low
you better believe I'll be down by your shoes
if you want it all, you can have it all
if you want some more, come and get some more
'cause the dirt feels good when you're underground
you better believe that we're all getting down
you know that us feral kids love straying about
so start giving in, yeah you better get down",2006
Girl,Beck,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/girl.html,"I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I would not try

I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling

So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today, ah-ah ah...

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind...

I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye
Can help you from yourself

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind...

Please Mr. Agony
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life

We live in a free world...

Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

There's the man I chose

I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over 
We will still belong to each other

Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true 
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos 
Of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure,
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole
life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on
the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

[Chorus]

Otherwise the bar is ours,
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
cars
The sun and the moon but

Squished a rotten peach in my fist

She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah

But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
It's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life,
You'll want her just the same, and now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her.

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

Come Sail Away,Styx,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/styx/comesailaway.html,"I'm sailing away, set an open course for the virgin sea
Cause I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board, I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea, reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can to carry on

A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said
They said come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me now
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me

Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me now
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me

I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies
Singing come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me now
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me

Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away, come sail away",1977
Oxford Comma,Vampire Weekend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vampireweekend/oxfordcomma.html,"Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma? 
I've seen those English dramas too 
They're cruel 
So if there's any other way 
To spell the word 
It's fine with me, with me 

Why would you speak to me that way 
Especially when I always said that I 
Haven't got the words for you 
All your diction dripping with disdain 
Through the pain 
I always tell the truth 

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma? 
I climbed to Dharamsala too 
I did 
I met the highest lama 
His accent sounded fine 
To me, to me 

Check your handbook 
It's no trick 
Take the chapstick 
Put it on your lips 
Crack a smile 
Adjust my tie 
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys 

Why would you lie about how much coal you have? 
Why would you lie about something dumb like that? 
Why would you lie about anything at all? 
First the window, then it's to the wall 
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth 

Check your passport 
It's no trick 
Take the chapstick 
Put it on your lips 
Crack a smile 
Adjust my tie 
Know your butler, unlike other guys 
Why would you lie about how much coal you have? 
Why would you lie about something dumb like that? 
Why would you lie about anything at all? 
First the window, then it's through the wall 
Why would you tape my conversations? 
Show your paintings 
At the United Nations

Scenic World,Beirut,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beirut/scenicworld.html,"The lights go on
The lights go off

A scenic world, where the sun sets are all
Breathtaking, breathtaking",2006
Crooked Teeth,Death Cab for Cutie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/crookedteeth.html,"It was one hundred degrees,
As we sat beneath
A willow tree,
Whose tears didn't care,
They just hung in the air,
And refused to fall, to fall.

And I knew I'd made a horrible call,
And now the state line felt like the Berlin Wall,
And there was no doubt about which side I was on.

'Cause I built you a home in my heart,
With rotten wood meant to cave from the start.

'Cause you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I braved treacherous streets,
And kids strung out on homemade speed.
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep,
At all

'Cause at night the sun in retreat,
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth,
In the mouth of a man who was devouring
Us both.

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech,
But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

I'm a war of head versus heart,
And it's always this way.
My head is weak, my heart always speaks,
Before I know what it will say.

And you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
No, you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.

No, you can't find nothing at all,
If there was nothing there all along.
There were churches, theme parks and malls,
But there was nothing there all along.",2005
Parklife,Blur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blur/parklife.html,"Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as parklife
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as parklife

John's got brewers droop he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons
They love a bit of it (parklife)
Who's that gut lord marching?
You should cut down on your pork life mate
Get some exercise

All the people
So many people
They all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

Know what I mean

I get up when I want except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen
Parklife
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving the house
Parklife

I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too
It gives me a sense of enormous well-being
Parklife
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it

All the people
So many people
They all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

Country House,Blur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blur/countryhouse.html,"So the story begins

City dweller
Successful fella
Thought to himself, ""Oops, I've got a lot of money.""
Caught in a rat race terminally

I'm a professional cynic
But my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the century's anxiety

Yes, it preys on him
He's getting thin
Try the simple life

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats
In the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills
In the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
Lots of rural charm
In the country

He's got morning glory
And life's a different story
Everything's going Jackanory
Touched with his own mortality

He's reading Balzac
And knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand
That makes you feel wonderfully bland
Oh it's a century's remedy

For the faint at heart
A new start
Try the simple life

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest
In the country
He doesn't drink smoke laugh
Takes herbal baths
In the country
But you'll come to no harm
On the animal farm
In the country

In the country, in the country, in the country

Blow, blow me out
I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out
I am so sad, I don't know why

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats
In the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills
In the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
Lots of rural charm
In the country

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest

She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.",2008

Billy Liar,The Decemberists,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/decemberists/billyliar.html,"Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
Staring over at the neighbor's, knickers down.
He's got his knickers down.

So the summer is eternity for you?
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
He's shaking you down.

And the mailroom shift gets a real short shrift
As you dole out the packages, no-one seems to want you around
All skulking around.

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.

All a-drifting, he's a no-good boyo
Sent a-fishing for a whalebone corset frame
(His only catch all day)

So he sits and lets the current take him
A gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray
And at his ankles laid.

As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!

Let you legs loll on the lino
'Til your sinews spoil
Will you stay here for a while, dear,
'Til the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar.",2003

At Least I'm Not as Sad (as I Used to Be),fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/atleastimnotassadasiusedtobe.html,"Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

Câmon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, at least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, itâs been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You shouldâve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

Câmon can you count all the loves that didnât last?
Itâs such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I donât want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.
At least Iâm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said we wouldâve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youthâs taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing....

So I left, that is it. Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.
I donât keep friends, I keep acquainted,
Iâm not a prophet, but Iâm here to profit.

Thatâs all, Iâm gone! Thatâs my life, nothing is sacred.

With photographs we never took

The night time is so pretty
With all the stars above your eyes
I'm sneaking out and making ties

Finding myself, or start a career
Could work the poor, though I'm hungry for fame

Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat
Aren't things more easy, with a tight six pack
Who knows the answers, who do you trust
I can't even separate love from lust
Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans
Working nine to five, answering phones
But don't make me live for Friday nights
Drinking eight pints and getting in fights
Maybe I'll just fall in love
That could solve it all
Philosophers say that that's enough
There surely must be more
Love ain't the answer, nor is work
The truth eludes me so much it hurts
But I'm still having fun and I guess that's the key

But you will always get what you want

Took a little time to make it a little better
It's only going up, just one thing and another
You know, you know

Took a little time to make it a little better,
It's only going up, just one thing and another
You know, you know

Let's make this happen, girl
You gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started girl
We're moving up, moving up

But you will always get what you want

Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation
Shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?

Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh oh

Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place?
Born to blossom, bloom to perish

Your moment will run out
'Cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable (uh huh)

Centerfold,The J. Geils Band,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jgeilsband/centerfold.html,"Come on

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (wooh)
My memory has just been sold
(Angel is the centerfold)

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft, fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligÃ©e
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
Yeah, my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (oh yeah)
(Angel is the centerfold)

(Na, na, na...)

Yeah, now listen
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no Never-Never Land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take your car, yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (wooh)
My memory has just been sold

Alright, alright

I love it when you call
I love it when you call

Better Things,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/betterthings.html,"That was our fifth song
And I hope you enjoyed it
Now this would be our best song
That you have ever heard
The dirt bike's going on stage
Thank you

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where
The neighbors won't read meals

And the family heirloom jewelry
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never ever seen

Like the gods, like the glory, like the stories
That your fathers set before you
Ride the tiger 'round the kingdom, oh no
Oh no, there's a meeting in the canyons
Oh no, this is rising to the clouds

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

I'm shooting off the cannons
And the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave but the ones heap
Are the ones we'll never keep

Just pretend that things are mobile
And they're never staying put
And the way we were the day
We climbed to the top of the steeple

With it's people spewing angels out their mouths
And letting tables turn to charcoal
In the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening
Oh no, we were waving like the trees
Oh no, then they moved us to the sky

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

Two or three times the bell will ring
It's when we look for the better things
We search for this, we all have none
I feel it crash upon your skin

I find it hard to believe there's more
Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Do I miss you like you miss me?

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming

Life Is a Highway,Rascal Flatts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rascalflatts/lifeisahighway.html,"Whooo umm yeah

Life is like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Ooh, yeah

There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah

Baby You're a Rich Man,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/babyyourearichman.html,"How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are.
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eyes can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo

Lessons Learned,Matt & Kim,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mattkim/lessonslearned.html,"Tape holds things that cannot stick
And keep leftovers in the fridge
While lessons learned go down the drain
I can't believe everything
And all the bad names gone
And the good ones were all wrong

And so I stayed up all night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking 'bout tomorrow won't change
How I feel today

Never let your mark erase
'Cause broken legs can be replaced
Two steps to the finish line
Three sips 'til I finish mine
A straw will always suck it out
Close your eyes and use your mouth
And tell me 'bout your song

And so I stayed up all night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking 'bout tomorrow won't change
How I feel today",2009
Do It Again,The Beach Boys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beachboys/doitagain.html,"It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go

Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again

With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight

Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)

Well I've been thinking 'bout
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again

Carried Away,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/carriedaway.html,"Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold in
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper, my money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend

Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

All your appeal
Once again we'd feel it
Higher education making sense

Justify your thesis
Certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defence

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can

Let's agree there's no need
No more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Won't you have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

Captains and Cruise Ships,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/captainsandcruiseships.html,"I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you",P:

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad

Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep

Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask for me
Open up the gate for you

True love they've been without it
But all their daughters put me down

She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter

Off the top of 
A tall building

Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hungover
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
And just what it was worth

And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable 
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through 
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world

And I feel like....

So I take my 
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving

Well I feel just like a child 
Well I feel just like a child 
From my womb to my tomb 
I guess I'll always be a child 

Well some people try and treat me like a man 
Yeah some people try and treat me like a man 
Well I guess they just don't understand 
Well some people try and treat me like a man 
They think I know shit 
But that's just it 
I'm a child 

Well I need you to tell me what to wear 
Yeah I need you to help and comb my hair 
Yeah I need you to help tie my shoes 
Yeah I need you to come and keep me amused 
From my cave to my grave 
I guess I'll always be a child 

Well I need you to help me reach the door 
And I need you to walk me to the store 
And I need you to please explain the war 
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore 
You can tell by my smile 
That I'm a child 

And I need you to sit me on your lap 
And I need you to make me take my nap 
Could you first pull out a book and 
Read me some of that 
Cause I need you to make me take my nap 

And I need you to recognize my friends 
Cause they're there even though you don't see them 
They got their own share of plate and a seat 
You know I won't touch my food unless they eat 
From the roof to the floor I'll crawl around some more 
I'm a child 

And I need you to help me blow my nose 
And I need you to help me count my toes 
And I need you to help me put on my clothes 
And I need you to hide it when it shows 
From being my daddy's sperm to being packed in an urn 
I'm a child

And when I steal you gotta smack me 'til I cry 
Don't you stop 'til the tears run dry 
See I was born thinking under the sky 
Didn't belong to a couple of old white guys 
From sucking on my mother's breast 
To when they lay my tomb to rest 
I'm a child yeah 

Well I'm a little child
Well I'm a little child
I guess I'm always be 
A little child",2005
Laid,James,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/james/laid.html,"This bed is on fire with passionate love
The neighbours complain about the noises above
But she only comes when she's on top

My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no

Ah, you think you're so pretty...

Caught your hand inside the till
Slammed your fingers in the door
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in women's clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty

Moved out of the house so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy
When are you coming home?",1993
Virtual Insanity,Jamiroquai,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiroquai/virtualinsanity.html,"Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
Cos' we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these -

Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh - it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told.

Futures made of virtual insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad.
I know yeah

Of this virtual insanity, we're livin in.
Has got to change, yeah
Things, will never be the same.
And I can't go on
While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
Oh, this world, has got to change
Cos I just, I just can't keep going on, it was virtual.
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
That virtual insanity is what it is

Futures made of virtual insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

Living - Virtual Insanity
Living - Virtual Insanity
Living - Virtual Insanity
Living - Virtual Insanity

Virtual Insanity is what we're living in",1996
Bright Side Of The Road,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/brightsideoftheroad.html,"From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again on the
Bright side of the road

Little darlin', come with me
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road

Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye

Let's enjoy it while we can
Won't you help me sing my song
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road

From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again on the bright side of the road",1979
Us,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/us.html,"They made a statue of us
And put it on a mountain top
Now tourists come and stare at us
Blow bubbles with their gum
Take photographs of fun, have fun

They'll name a city after us
And later say it's all our fault
Then they'll give us a talking to
Then they'll give us a talking to
'Cause they've got years of experience
We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
We're living in a den of thieves
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious

We wear our scarves just like a noose
But not 'cause we want eternal sleep
And though our parts are slightly used
New ones are slave labor you can keep

We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
We're living in a den of thieves
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious

They made a statue of us
They made a statue of us
The tourists come and stare at us
The sculptor's marble sends regards
They made a statue of us
They made a statue of us
Our noses have begun to rust
We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
We're living in a den of thieves

And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious",2004

Come On Eileen,Save Ferris,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/saveferris/comeoneileen.html,"Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them
Now you're grown, so grown, now I must say more than ever
Go toora loora toora loo rye aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

[Chorus:]
Come on Eileen, oh I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah come on Eileen

These people round here wear beaten down eyes
Sunk in smoke dried faces
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no never), no not us (no never)
We are far too young and clever
Remember
Go toora loora toora loo rye aye
Eileen I'll hum this tune forever

Come on Eileen oh I swear (what he means)
Ah come on, let's take off everything
That pretty red dress Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah come on let's, Ah come on Eileen
That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen
Please...

Come on Eileen too-loo rye-aye 
Come on Eileen too-loo rye-aye 
Toora toora-too-loora

Come on Eileen, these things they are real and I know
how you feel

My Moon My Man,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/mymoonmyman.html,"My moon, my man
So changeable and
Such a loveable lamb to me

My care, my coat
Leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go but on

Heart on my sleeve
Not where it should be
The song's out of key again

My moon's white face
What day and what phase
It's the calendar page again

Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please

My moon and me
Not as good as we've been
It's the dirtiest clean I know

My care, my coat
Leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go
There's nowhere to go

Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please

Save Tonight,Eagle-Eye Cherry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eagleeyecherry/savetonight.html,"Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh)

Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish - I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away (ohh it's true)

It ain't easy to say good-bye
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/yourbodyisawonderland.html,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland",2001
Last Christmas,Wham!,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wham/lastchristmas.html,"Happy Christmas

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someoneâ
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someoneâ

I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someoneâ
I'll give it to someoneâ

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away

Honey-honey looks like a superstar.
She got a promise of love-struck fascination.

And this love fool-osophy is killing
Previous illusions thatâ
I'm a love foolâ
I had in my mind about you.
I'm a love fool.

Seems so true: all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling
Andâ
I'm a love foolâ
My love: it means nothing to you.
So, maybe I'm still a love fool.

She shimmers like a California sunset.
Lady-lady glitters, but there's no gold.
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas.
I'm so delirious.
Is she that serious
Or is she bringing me on?
I've been waiting so long.

And this love fool-osophy is killing previous illusions thatâ
I'm a love foolâ

I don't want the world I want you

Hey There Delilah,Plain White T's,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/plainwhitets/heytheredelilah.html,"Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

Nine in the Afternoon,Panic! at the Disco,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/panicatthedisco/nineintheafternoon.html,"Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know

Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?

Back to the place
Where we used to say
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place,
Back to the room where it all began (hey)
Back to the room where it all began

You only wanted me for having fun
But now I think you've gone and had your way

So goodnight, goodnight
Walk away from the door
Walk away from my life

I threw 'em out when I threw out your keys
Along with all your records I can't stand
You never even listen to any one of them
You're never gonna drag me out again
With all the people that were never ever even your friends

This isn't goodnight, this is goodbye...

So goodnight, goodnight
You're embarrassing me 
You're embarrassing you
So goodnight, goodnight.
Walk away from the door
Walk away from my life

So goodnight, goodnight
You're embarrassing me 
You're embarrassing you
So goodnight, goodnight
Walk away from the door
Walk away from my life
So goodnight",2005
And She Was,Talking Heads,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/talkingheads/andshewas.html,"And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was) and she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
Drifting this way and that
Not touching ground at all
Up above the yard

[CHORUS]

She was glad about it... no doubt about it
She isn't sure where she's gone
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

[CHORUS]

Joining the world of missing persons (and she was)
Missing enough to feel alright (and she was)",1985
Our Song,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/oursong.html,"I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have.""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song",2006
I Saw Her Standing There,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/isawherstandingthere.html,"(1,2,3,4!)

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ""boom""
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ""boom""
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)

Animal,Miike Snow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/miikesnow/animal.html,"There was a time when my world
Was filled with darkness, darkness, darkness
Then I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something, something, something

In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
I knew before, long, long, long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up?

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal

There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money, money, money
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running, running, running
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
Who could be strong

Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up?

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal

We Can Work It Out,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/wecanworkitout.html,"Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way,
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong

Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,The Police,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/police/everylittlethingshedoesismagic.html,"Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve
As I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

(Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
Every little
Every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Thing she does is magic

Every little thing she does is magic magic magic
Magic magic magic

Off the Florida Keys
there's a place called Kokomo

tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go,
way down in Kokomo.

Martinique, that Monserrat mystique...

We'll put out to sea
and we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
a little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight,
cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye,
give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse...

Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go to get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Did you do too many drugs, too, baby?

It reminds me of you... ooh-ooh-ooh.

I need a date to the prom, would you like to come along?
But nobody would go to the prom with me, baby...
They didn't like American music, they never heard American music.
They didn't know the music was in my soul, baby...

You were born too soon, I was born too late,
But every time I look at that ugly lake, it reminds me of me.

Do you like American music? We like American music.
I like American music... Baby.
Do you like American music? We like all kinds of music.

In My Life,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/inmylife.html,"There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world

Kick through continents bustin' boundaries

The World at Large,Modest Mouse,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/theworldatlarge.html,"Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand. 
I move on to another day, 
to a whole new town with a whole new way. 
Went to the porch to have a thought. 
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop. 
You don't know where and you don't know when. 
But you still got your words and you got your friends. 
Walk along to another day. 
Work a little harder, work another way. 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan. 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
Well float on maybe would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold. 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old. 
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast. 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most. 
The days get longer and the nights smell green. 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave. 

I like songs about drifters - books about the same. 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane. 
Walked on off to another spot. 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want. 
Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights. 
Outside, water like air was great. 
I didn't know what I had that day. 
Walk a little farther to another plan. 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand. 

I know that starting over is not what life's about. 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth. 
My thoughts were so loud.",2004

They're like,
""Alright""
What ya saying,
""Yeah can I take your digits?""
And you're like, ""no not in a million years, you're nasty
please leave me alone.""

Cut to the pub on our last night out,
Man at the bar cos it was his shout,
Clocks this bird and she looks OK,
Caught him looking and she walks his way,
""Alright darling, you gonna buy us a drink then?""
""Err no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend...""

She's got no taste hand on his waist, tries to pull away but her lips on his face,
""If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer""
""Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture.""

Can't knock em out, can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you can't have my number,
""Why?""
Because I've lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant, having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah...

""I recognize this guy's way of thinking...""
As he comes over her face starts sinking,
She's like,
""Oh here we go..""
It's a routine check that she already knows, she's thinking: ""They're all the same.""

""Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?""
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag, tries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light,
""Here use mine""
""You see the thing is I just don't have the time.""

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?
Go away now I've made myself clear,
Nah it's not gonna happen,
Not in a a million years,

Nah I've gotta go cos my house is on fire,

American Boy,Estelle,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/estelle/americanboy.html,"[Kanye West:]
This a number-one champion sound.
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down, get down.
Who the hottest in the world right now.
Just touched down in London town.

Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
Yes.
Tell the promoter we need more seats.
We just sold out all the floor seats.

[Estelle:]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.

He said, ""Hey, sister.
It's really, really nice to meet you.""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type.
Like the way he's speaking,
His confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans
But I'm 'a like what's underneath them.

And, no, I ain't been to MIA.
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake.
First let's see the West End.
I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm liking this American boy, American boy.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy, American boy

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Will you be my American boy, American boy?

Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping, maybe, then we'll go to a cafÃ©.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.

Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneakers looking fresh to death.
I'm loving those Shell Toes.
Walking that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm liking this American boy, American boy.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.

Tell 'em wagwan blud.

[Kanye West:]
Who killing 'em in the UK.
Everybody gonna say, ""You, K.""
Reluctantly 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me.

Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down,
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool. Oww, oww.
Ain't nothing new now now.

He crazy. I know what you thinking.
Ribena I know what you're drinking.
Rap singer. Chain blinger.
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking.

What's your persona
About this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer.

Dressed smart like a London bloke.
Yes.
Before he speak his suit bespoke.
And you thought he was cute before.
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke.

And I know you ain't into all that.
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that cash
'Cause a lot of wags wanna hear it.

And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest.
Like The Pips at they Gladys.
And I know they love it.
So to hell with all that rubbish.

[Estelle:]
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Would you be my American boy, American boy?

Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay.

You'll be my American boy, be my American boy.

I'm gonna send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs
Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex
I be seeing you all up in there late at night
I understand when your girl is stressing you out
(Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying?
Don't let the ladies fool you all now, fellows
They be doin' the same thing you all be doin'

Turn up my symphony!
Drop a BEAT!)

Just 'cause she dances go-go
It don't make her a ho, no
Maxine, put your red shoes on
We going to the disco
We gonna elope to Mexico
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo

[Verse 1]
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling down, type of tears that money couldn't buy

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2]
[Wyclef]
Excuse me, what is your name?
[Hope]
Uh, my name is Hope, yo
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses
Have you any idea how hard this is?
I could flex in 25 positions
But I only work here to pay my tuition
Yo, tantalizing teaser
Table-top pleaser
Give me what I need a Mastercard a Visa
Lap dance fantasy
Picture us on an all white canopy
Wyclef extended his hand to me
Like Billy D. said he's feeling me
Take me away from here, so far
Where they ride horses, no cars
No more stripping in bars
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds

[Chorus 2X]

(Yo a lot of you all sitting with you all girls
fronting like the Budweiser commercial
Talking about, 'I, I don't be going to the strip joints'
You're lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.
I got one question for you liars, man)

Shot callers, what are you, a preacher?
You're calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone.
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card
And told me if I ever have problems,
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah

Call up my mama said I'm in love with a stripper yo!

All the Pretty Girls,fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/alltheprettygirls.html,"All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.

So I call your name, cross my fingers
Uncross the others, hesitate.
Oh, I don't think straight with nothing to prove.

I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I will stay until the weekend.
And you can take all your things;
The boxes and rings and get going.

'Cause I've been waiting for...

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, you'll come to me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

So I call (I call) you out (out, baby)
Just to feel a little bit better about myself (he does)
I do (you do), baby, I do, I do, I do
Until their lips start to move,
And their friends talk music
I say, ""I've never heard the tune.""
But I have, I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you.

Every single night ends up the same,
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name.
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be, you'll come with me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

But not you,
You still wear boots and your hair is too long
And then this one doesn't want to admit she's fallen in love
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things
That define you and me
Everything we've become,
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone.

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, you'll come with me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

But not you,
I feel your faith is destroying the world
And then this one never really understood
The 80s is over and done
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

Say, all the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night

The Calculation,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/thecalculation.html,"You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
Until we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so
Hey hey hey hey

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard 'til they sparked

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

Oo oo oo oo oo oo [until the song fades]",2009

Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for

I never knew you (don't give up on me)

Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and everytime I am yours and you are mine

Little league in '93 taught me how to take defeat
Good thing there's no mercy rule in love cause I would long be beat
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
Accept my loss and head back to the mound

People still actually give a shit about the Queen
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
and Brighton's lovely in the Fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
Paul and Sorrel too
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley

Performing with the Apples
and then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
because we hadn't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station

Up to our necks in crisps and litter
in the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter",2004
