I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/imyours.html,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
There's no need to complicate.
'Cause our time is short.
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
I'm yours.

Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh,
Baby, do you believe, I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours.

Grace Kelly,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/gracekelly.html,"""I wanna talk to you.""
""The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears. I promise you it won't happen again.""

Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty?
Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome
I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me without making me try?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I try a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door!

""Getting angry doesn't solve anything.""

How can I help it
How can I help it
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby
Hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink
Why don't you like me
Why don't you like me
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over?
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I try a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door!

Say what you want to satisfy yourself
But you only want what everybody else says you should want

[2x]
I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

Here Comes the Sun,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/herecomesthesun.html,"Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

5 Years Time,Noah and the Whale,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/noahandthewhale/5yearstime.html,"Oh well in five years time we could be walking round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun - so what the heck!

Cos I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
Cos it's what we needed to have a good time

And it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well I'll look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say
""Yah well I feel all pretty happy too""
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it'll be love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking about them as I'm lying in bed
And I know that I believe, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time I might not know you
In five years time we might not speak
In five years time we might not get along
In five years time you might just prove me wrong

Oh there'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love

Mushaboom,Feist,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/feist/mushaboom.html,"Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road
Knee deep snow
Watching the fire as we grow old
Old dirt road
Rambling rose
Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold",2004

LDN,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/ldn.html,"Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my license
It doesn't get me down and I feel OK
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sitting with a slapper
Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

[Chorus]
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
you can see it's all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walking down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
I believe that it's called al fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand

But before she had time to accept it
hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
walking round London town

[Chorus]
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes

Wait 'til your momma and your papa's gone, papa's gone

Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile
Hook her, book her, nook her, walk away!

Licks her lips like there's something on them
Tries to tell you life has just begun
But you know she's getting something other
Than the love from her mother

This Monday morning walk
Right past the fabulous mess we're in

As I take your hand
And you take my kiss
And I take the world

The places I've been
The songs that I have sung
The wonders I've seen
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Who is the one that leads me on through

It's you
Who puts me in the magic position, darling now
You put me in the magic position
To live, to learn, to love in the major key

And I know how you've hurt
And been dragged through the dirt
But c'mon get back up
It's the time to live
So give your love to me
I'm gonna keep it carefully
Deep in the treasure chest below my breast
'Cause out of all the people I've known
The places I've been
The songs that I have sung
The wonders I've seen
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Who is the one that leads me on through

Would you go along with someone like me

I did before and had my share, it didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you

Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too

And we don't care about our own folks
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care about is talking
Talking only me and you

No one will surprise me unless you do
I can tell there's something goin' on, hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving, I'm still with you

I've been awake for a while now

I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm

You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while
Now just take your time
Wherever you go

But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just mmmmm

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while
Now just take your time
Wherever you go

Ohbodododododododum mmm mmm

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time

Left you with nothing but they want some more

Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, You know who you are

Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart

Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are

One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite

To see you eat in the middle of the night

That's Not My Name,The Ting Tings,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tingtings/thatsnotmyname.html,"Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue and I
I keep stalling, keeping me together
People around gotta find something to say now

Holding back, everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider they forget my name (ame, ame, ame)

[Chorus:]
They call me 'hell'
They call me 'Stacey'
They call me 'her'
They call me 'Jane'
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet'
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now

So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away
Listen to me, I'm not
Although I'm dressed up, out and all with
Everything considered they forget my name
(ame, ame, ame)

[Chorus]

[Jules in the background:]
This song was in my head, now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
Though I realize, I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around, but just a promise, nothing binding
However can't you see, that you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-along, this song is monotone
I gotta get some soul, gotta get some feeling....

Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?
Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?

I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home with you

But I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

Suddenly I See,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/suddenlyisee.html,"Her face is a map of the world
Is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl
She's a beautiful girl

And everything around her is a silver pool of light
The people who surround her feel the benefit of it
It makes you calm
She holds you captivated in her palm

Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

I feel like walking the world
Like walking the world
You can hear she's a beautiful girl
She's a beautiful girl

She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember
What you heard
She likes to leave you hanging on her word

Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

And she's taller than most
And she's looking at me
I can see her eyes looking from the page of a magazine
She makes me feel like I could be a tower
A big strong tower
The power to be
The power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah (suddenly I see)
She got the power to be
The power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah (suddenly I see)

She Moves in Her Own Way,The Kooks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kooks/shemovesinherownway.html,"So at my show on Monday
I was hoping someday
You'd be on your way to better things
It's not about your make-up
Or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey

So now you pour your heart out
You're telling me you're far out
You're not about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
'Cos I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

Well uh oh, oh I love her because she moves in her own way
Well uh oh, oh she came to my show just to hear about my day

And at the show on Tuesday
She was in her mindset
Tempered furs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving
Make me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey
Yeah

So wont you go far
Tell me you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause
And you don't pull my strings
'Cos I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

Well oh oh, oh I love her because she moves in her own way
Well oh oh, oh she came to my show just to hear about my day

yes I wish that we never made it
Through all the summers
They're keeping us instead of
Kicking us back
Down through the suburbs
yes I wish that we never made it
Through all the summers
They're keeping us instead of
Kicking us back

Kiss Me,Sixpence None the Richer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sixpencenonethericher/kissme.html,"Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor,
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor,
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

So kiss me [3x]",1997

Walks into the room
Feels like a big balloon
I said, 'Hey, girl, you are beautiful.'
Diet Coke and a pizza please
Diet Coke, I'm on my knees
Screaming, 'Big girl, you are beautiful.'

You take your skinny girl
I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman
Needs a real man here's why

You take your girl
And multiply her by four
Now a whole lot of woman
Needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
Find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on around
And they'll be calling you baby

No need to fantasize
Since I was in my braces
A watering hole
With the girls around
And curves in all the right places

All Star,Smash Mouth,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashmouth/allstar.html,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play

And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine

I'll be the one to hold the gun

I know more than I knew before
I didn't rest I didn't stop
Did we fight or did we talk

Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun

I love you more
I love you more
I don't know what I knew before
But now I know I wanna win the war

No one likes to take a test
Sometimes you know more is less
Put your weight against the door
Kick drum on the basement floor
Stranded in a fog of words
Loved him like a winter bird
On my head the water pours
Gulf stream through the open door
Fly away
Fly away to what you want to make

I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all I feel it all
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card inside, wild card inside

Oh I'll be the one to break my heart

I'll end it though you started it

Wouldn't It Be Nice,The Beach Boys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beachboys/wouldntitbenice.html,"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby ...",1966
Time to Pretend,MGMT,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mgmt/timetopretend.html,"I'm feeling rough I'm feeling raw I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars

This is our decision to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We were fated to pretend, to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We were fated to pretend, to pretend

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah",P:  
Fidelity,Regina Spektor,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/fidelity.html,"(Shake it up)

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground

I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind all this music

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

And suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose we never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall

All my friends say that of course it's gonna get better
Gonna get better
Better better better better
Better better better

And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hair do

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Steal My Sunshine,Len,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/len/stealmysunshine.html,"[Intro (on album version):]

Hey, Matt
[Matt:]
Yeah, Tim?

Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
[Matt:]
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
[Tim:]
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well maybe we should cheer him up then
[Matt:]
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
[Tim:]
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Marc:]
I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
All twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say
What you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Marc (Sharon):]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Tim:]
Well, I, ""Jared, I love you!""

[Sharon:]
I was lying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws
Out of big fat Slurpee treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Marc (Sharon):]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not as some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine

Fireflies,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/fireflies.html,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams",2009
Say Hey (I Love You),Michael Franti & Spearhead,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaelfrantispearhead/sayheyiloveyou.html,"Come down selector

This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't wanna write a love song for the world
I just wanna write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
OK
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
OK
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Rocking rocking
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
Sure

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
Alright
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, take off your shoes

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma

What are gonna do, papa

My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing
That I love you

I say hey, I'll be gone today
OK
But I'll be back all around the way
You promise
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I love you, I love you, I love you
It's true, it's true
I love you, I love you, I love you

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa
Hey momma, hey momma
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Come on, hey poppa, hey poppa",2008
Lemon Tree,Fool's Garden,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/foolsgarden/lemontree.html,"I'm sitting here in a boring room, it's just another rainy
Sunday afternoon. I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast, I'm
Driving too far. I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
A yellow lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

Sing: dah...

I'm sitting here, I miss the power, I'd like to go out,
Taking a shower, but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed, where nothing ever
Happens - and I wonder.

Isolation - is not the good for me.
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy. Baby anyhow I'll get
Another toy and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
Another lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.",1996
Such Great Heights,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/suchgreatheights.html,"I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch,
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio,
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening

And that frankly will not fly.
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now.""
They will see us waving from such great heights,
""Come down now.""",2003
You Can Call Me Al,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/youcancallmeal.html,"A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard""
Bonedigger, bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff
Amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, woe my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my role model is
Gone gone?""
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatter-lings and orphanages

He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen!"" and ""Hallelujah!""

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me

Na na na na â¦

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty

If you'll be my bodyguard ...",1986
You Get What You Give,New Radicals,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newradicals/yougetwhatyougive.html,"Wake up kids
We've got the dreamer's disease
Age 14
We got you down on your knees
So polite,
We're busy still saying please

Frienemies,
Who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night
We smash their Mercedes-Benz
First we run
And then we laugh 'til we cry

[Pre-chorus:]
But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light, light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

[Chorus:]
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home baby
You're tops, give it to me now

Four A.M. we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke but hey we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial

[Pre-chorus:]
But when the night is falling
You cannot find your friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend

[Chorus]

This whole damn world can fall apart
You'll be OK, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
(don't give up)
Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance rip off lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson,
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around
We'll kick your ass in!

Don't let go
One dance left

[Unsaid lyrics from liner]
Championed by a soulless media misleading
People unaware they're bleeding
No one with a brain is believing
It's so sad you lost the meaning
Never knew it anyway
Human natures so predictable
I'm a fool to do your dirty work whoa, whoa",1998
Smile,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/smile.html,"When you first left me I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door, what you do that for (what you do that for)?
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala lalala

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,

You! Me! Dancing!,Los Campesinos!,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loscampesinos/youmedancing.html,"The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis
Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed

And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were its not the scene you're thinking of
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
If only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing

And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Says as long as we're here everything is alright

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

One thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing

And I always get confused,
because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
but in discos they turn them on.
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.
And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature:
we're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy.",P:  
Birdhouse in Your Soul,They Might Be Giants,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/theymightbegiants/birdhouseinyoursoul.html,"I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary one note* spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels its always near

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

(and while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the
Birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)

Unwritten,Natasha Bedingfield,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/natashabedingfield/unwritten.html,"I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Open up the dirty window

Brown Eyed Girl,Van Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanmorrison/browneyedgirl.html,"Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah.

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass

Crawling on your knees toward it
Making momma so proud
But your voice is too loud

You pick the insects off plants
No time to think of consequences

Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

The water is warm
But it's sending me shivers
A baby is born
Crying out for attention
The memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decisions to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not

Walk of Life,Dire Straits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/direstraits/walkoflife.html,"Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here comes Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mmm, you do the walk of life",1985
No Rain,Blind Melon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindmelon/norain.html,"All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do
Is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane,
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me,
""I'll always be there when you wake.""
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain
That there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away,
But it's a great escape
Escape... escape... escape...

All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view
You think that I'm insane
It's not sane... it's not sane.

I just want someone to say to me,
""I'll always be there when you wake.""
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made oh no no no
You know I'm really gonna
Really gonna
Have it made
And I'll have it made

Alright,Supergrass,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/supergrass/alright.html,"We are young
We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright

We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright

Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash
Bought some wheels
Took it out
'Cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright

Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young
We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright

Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our world

Semi-Charmed Life,Third Eye Blind,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thirdeyeblind/semicharmedlife.html,"Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said...

How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said...

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive,
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress one

And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else to get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I was taking sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
And I wish I could get back there (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)

I want something else (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)",1997
Strawberry Swing,Coldplay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/strawberryswing.html,"They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking under strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water what you say?
When it's suchâ¦
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait until the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
When it's suchâ¦
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Ah-ah-ah-ah-iiiiii

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Oh the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time",2008
Just Like Heaven,The Cure,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/justlikeheaven.html,"""Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick?
The one that makes me scream."" she said
""The one that makes me laugh."" she said
And threw her arms around my neck
""Show me how you do it,
And I promise you,
I promise that
I'll run away with you,
I'll run away with you.""

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
""Why are you so far away?"" she said,
""Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you.""

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven",1987
Viva la Vida,Coldplay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/vivalavida.html,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",2008
Getting Better,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/gettingbetter.html,"It's getting better all the time

Australia,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/australia.html,"Time to put the ear-covers on!
No!

Born to, born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies,
All you want's one more Saturday.

Well, look here, until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air
And your feet in the fetters
'Til the day...
They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes.

You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with a dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried.

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands,
You keep 'em folded in your lap,
Or raise them up to beg for scraps,
You know, he's holding you down
With the tips of his fingers just the same,
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late,
Or changed by a potion,
And find a handsome young mate
For you to love.

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe,
Well do it now or grow old,
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.

Been alone since you were twenty-one,
You haven't laughed since January,
You try and make like this is so much fun,
But we know it to be quite contrary.

Dare to be one of us, girl,
Facing the android's conundrum,
I felt like I should just cry,
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,
You're Himmler in your coat,
You don't know how long I have been,
Watching the lantern dim,
Starved of oxygen,
So give me your hand,
And let's jump out the window.",2007

Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself

Maybe I'll paint them in myself [x4]

These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight
It rings like all through the daylight

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
I'll just unplug it for today

Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight

And float down Grand Street in daylight [x4]

And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time

Dog Days Are Over,Florence + the Machine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florencethemachine/dogdaysareover.html,"Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back

She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it, she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Uh, thank God for mom and dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey, ya [repeat]

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved

If what they say is ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes, then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception
So why you, why you, why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here

Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey, ya
Hey, ya
Hey, ya
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey, ya
Just want you in my Caddy
Hey, ya
Don't want to meet your mama
Hey, ya
Just want to make you cumma
Hey, ya

Hey, ya

Hey, alright now
Alright now fellas yeah!

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

OK now ladies (yeah!)

Now don't have me to break this thing down for nothing
Now I wanna see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor

Here we go
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, shake it

Now all BeyoncÃ©s and Lucy Lius

Shake it like a Polaroid picture, sugar
You know what to do
You know what to do
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
You know what to do!

Mr. E's Beautiful Blues,Eels,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eels/mresbeautifulblues.html,"The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawling out her window 'cause her daddy 
He just don't care
Come on

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you gave us quite a scare

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The kids flip their lids when their ids hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor still he's moving to another town
And I don't believe he'll come back

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

Well i don't know how you take in all the shit you see
No don't believe anyone and most of all 
Don't believe me
Believe you

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day",2000
Alfie,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/alfie.html,"Oh, oh, deary me,
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed,
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC.

I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea,
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky,
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV,
My baby brother Alfie, how I wish that you could see.

I only say it 'cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair.
Now, now there's no need to swear,
Please don't despair, my dear mon frÃ¨re.

Oh, Alfie, get up. It's a brand new day,
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid.
Get off your lazy axs,
Alfie please use your brain

Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray,
I'm feeling guilty for leading you astray,
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid,
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

I only say it 'cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair.
Now, now there's no need to swear,
Please don't despair, my dear mon frÃ¨re.

Oh, little brother, please refrain from doing that,
I'm trying to help you out so can you stop being a twat.
It's time that you and I sat down and had a little chat,
And look me in the eyes. Take off that stupid fitted cap.

I only say it 'cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair.
Now, now there's no need to swear,
Please don't despair
Please don't despair, my mon frÃ¨re",2006

Daydream,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/daydream.html,"What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mown lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
I been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull dog

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom-made for a daydreaming boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy",1966

Slowly learning that life is OK.

""It's no better to be safe than sorry.""

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)

In a day or two

Oh, things that you say. Yeah.

You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

I'm a Believer,The Monkees,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monkees/imabeliever.html,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing,
Seems the more I gave the less I got.
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain.
When I needed sunshine I got rain.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

Love was out to get me
Now, that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Oh, then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
And not a trace of doubt in my mind.

Said I'm a believer

Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying
""I love you""

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

That took twenty-two years in the make,

Please learn from my mistakes,
Please learn from my mistakes.

Let's dance to joy division,
And celebrate the irony,
Everything is going wrong,
But we're so happy,
Let's dance to joy division,
And raise our glass to the ceiling,

But we're so happy,
Yeah we're so happy.

So if you're ever feeling down,
Grab your purse and take a taxi,
To the darker side of town,
That's where we'll be,
And we will wait for you and lead you through the dance floor,
Up to the DJ booth,
You know what to ask for,
You know what to ask for.

Go ask for Joy Division,

Everything is going wrong,
But we're so happy,
Let's dance to Joy Division,
And raise your glass to the ceiling,
'Cause this could all go so wrong,
But we're so happy,
So happy.

And someone's home

Living there too fills me with dread

This paranoia is distressing
But I spend most of my night guessing
Are we not, are we together
Will this make our lives much better

I'm not in love
I just wanna be touched

I just want your kiss boy, kiss boy, kiss boy
I just want your kiss

And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do

Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

May not know

Far away from each other every day?

Día de Enero,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/dadeenero.html,"Te conocÃ­ un dÃ­a de enero,
con la luna en mi nariz
Y como vÃ­ que eras sincero
En tus ojos me perdÃ­

Que torpe distracciÃ³n
Y que dulce sensaciÃ³n

Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
Como Eneas y Benitin
Ya te encontre varios rasguÃ±os
Que te hicieron por ahÃ­

Pero mi loco amor
Es tu mejor doctor

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo
Y todo va a pasar
Pronto verÃ¡s el sol brillar

TÃº mÃ¡s que nadie mereces ser feliz

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
hasta en tu propio paÃ­s
Si yo te digo Â¿Como dices tu?
Tu aÃºn dices Â¿Que decis?
Y lloras de emociÃ³n oyendo un bandoneÃ³n

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razÃ³n que hace doler tu corazÃ³n
Por eso quise hacerte esta canciÃ³n

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar",2005
Ruby,Kaiser Chiefs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kaiserchiefs/ruby.html,"Let it never be said
The Romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head

There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is canceled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held

'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in-between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you and me

Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you and me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me

Here It Goes Again,OK Go,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/okgo/hereitgoesagain.html,"It could be ten, but then again, I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four.
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa, and you leave me with my jaw on the floor.

[Chorus:]
Just when you think that you're in control,
just when you think that you've got a hold,
just when you get on a roll,
here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.
I should have known,
should have known,
should have known again,
but here it goes again.
Oh, here it goes again.

It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy, something inching past the edge of the reserve.
Now through lines of the cheap venetian blinds your car is pulling off of the curb.

[Chorus]

I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony, but Jesus, when it rains how it pours.
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa, and you leave me, yeah, you leave me.

I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

You're like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of",1981

Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/bowloforanges.html,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,
so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""{I am terribly sorry but} there is nothing I can do for you
{that} you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""
So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt.
He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""
So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.
And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.
But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself.
It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing...
Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,
I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,
then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company
through those days so long and black.
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve 
Of Love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole.
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.
Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,
like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.",2002

Happy Ending,Mika,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mika/happyending.html,"This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I'd guess I wish you well
Mm, a little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Little bit of love [repeat]
There ain't a better love
Little bit of love [repeat]
Need to be love, love
Little bit of love [repeat until the end]

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday, hey, hey, hey

No hope, no love, no glory

No more wondering where I belong.

A-Punk,Vampire Weekend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vampireweekend/apunk.html,"Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh-oh-oh

A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear she'd seen the thing
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh-oh-oh

I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh",2008

It goes over and over
The same old lines

And I drink cups of tea

the kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right
To put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

That I ought to stick to another man

Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

Spent my nights awake and I wondered
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

Sleepyhead,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/sleepyhead.html,"And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going

And you said
It was like fire around the brim
Burning solid
Burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I dragged you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

Go ahead",P:

What's impossible
Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
I don't want this feeling to go away

Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away

New Shoes,Paolo Nutini,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paolonutini/newshoes.html,"Woke up cold one Tuesday,
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick,
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life,
So I quickly opened the wardrobe,
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean,
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes,
That were ripped around the seams,
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me.

[Chorus:]
Hey, I put some new shoes on,
And suddenly everything is right,
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling,
It's so inviting,
Oh, short on money,
But long on time,
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
And I'm running late,
And I don't need an excuse,
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.

Woke up late one Thursday,
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes,
And I felt like there were two days missing,
As I focused on the time,
And I made my way to the kitchen,
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found,
A room full of all off my friends all dancing round and round,
And I thought hello new shoes,
Bye bye them blues.

[Chorus]

Take me wandering through these streets,
Where bright lights and angels meet,
Stone to stone they take me on,
I'm walking till' the break of dawn. [x2]

[Chorus x2]

Take me wandering through these streets",2006
Buddy Holly,Weezer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weezer/buddyholly.html,"What's with these homies, dissing my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all of time

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all of time

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

Bang, bang a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's the matter babe are you feeling sick?
What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?
What's the matter babe, are you feeling blue?

And that's for all of time
And that's for all of time

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that",1994
Brand New Colony,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/brandnewcolony.html,"I'll be the grapes fermented,
Bottled and served with the table set in my finest suit
Like a perfect gentlemen
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day

I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning
In an open tab when your judgment's on the brink
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there drifting off to sleep...
I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you...
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold

I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene,
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change,
We'll give ourselves new  names (identities erased)
The sun will heat the grounds
Under our bare feet in this brand new colony
Everything will change, oOo oOo...",2003
