1985,Bowling for Soup,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bowlingforsoup/1985.html,"Debbie just hit the wall
She never had it all
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door
When she turned twenty four
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

1985

She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become T.V.
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows
(on the radio was)

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

She hates time make it stop
When did MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, stop!
And bring back

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied

You Give Me Something,James Morrison,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmorrison/yougivemesomething.html,"You only stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water
But now I've gotten in too deep

For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing 
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
Because someday I might know my heart

You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what they mean

I never thought that I'd love someone
That was someone else's dream

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing 
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
Because someday I might call you from my heart

But it might be a second too late
And the words that I could never say
Are gonna come out anyway

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing 
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something

You give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing

Lookin' Out My Back Door,Creedence Clearwater Revival,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/creedenceclearwaterrevival/lookinoutmybackdoor.html,"Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy!
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch.
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin',

[CHORUS:]
Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door.

There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels.
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens.

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?
Doo, doo doo.
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician.

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,The Beatles,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/lucyintheskywithdiamonds.html,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

More Than a Feeling,Boston,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boston/morethanafeeling.html,"I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling
(more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(more than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling
(more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(more than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

I Say a Little Prayer,Aretha Franklin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arethafranklin/isayalittleprayer.html,"The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you

My darling, believe me

For me there is no one but you
Please love me too

And I'm in love with you

Answer my prayer now, babe

The Car Song,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/thecarsong.html,"The weekend is the weekend
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish and chips till it gets dark
I've got a lot of homework
But homework he can wait
I never start my homework till its already too late
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
But it's hard
When there's a basketball game in the park
It's 1998 
And everybody's saying:
""Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some dayÂ""

It's Monday bloody Monday
And there's two things I forgot
I forgot to do my homework
And I've only got one sock
I'm halfway through a test
But I just can't concentrate
I'm sitting next to Fontaine
I want to ask her on a date
I really want to start a conversation
But each time she walks past
I start choking on my pencil
And fall flat on my ass
I need to concentrate
I have to get this grade
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday

[BRIDGE]
But just right now
Can' think of anything better to do
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune
And maybe later 
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax 
And think of all the things I'm going to doÂ

[CHORUS]
SomedayÂ
I'll buy an old car
SomedayÂ
I'll get that car to start
SomedayÂ
I'll learn how to drive too
And then SomedayÂ
Imagine all the things I could do.

(That was 1998 now
Bring it forward to the present day now
Cause some things have changed
but some things never change)

The weekend is the weekend 
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish 'n' chips till it gets dark
I just saw Peter Parsons
Who used to be in my class
I always gave him wedgies cause I thought he worked too hard
He said, ""Harry, life is great""
I feel so happy these days
I'm a litigation lawyer
So I got it made
I'm going out with Fontaine 
Rememer her from tenth grade?
I drive a Porsche so I can't complainÂ

[BRIDGE]
Shit! And look at me can't think of anything better to do
That just sit down at the piano and write this tune
And maybe later
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax and think of all the things I'm going to doÂ

Me catch a ship across the sea
Me sail that ship all alone
Me never think how I'll make it home

Louie, Louie, no, no, no, no, no, I said we gotta go
Oh no, I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

Three nights and days I sail the sea
I think of girl constantly
On that ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said 
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now! 

Me see
Me see Jamaican moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

I said we gotta go now

Let's get on outta here

Let's go!",
Groove Is in the Heart,Deee-Lite,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deeelite/grooveisintheheart.html,"(We're going to dance and have some fun)
(Dig!)

The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)
I couldn't ask for another (Uh huh, uh huh)
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
(Watch out)

The depth of hula groove
Moves into the tenth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another

Unh, some looks in this torso
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know?
The live of truely delightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze
All inside of me, heart especially
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be
Flowin', glowin', electric eyes
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it
Can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the streets when I hear a funk beat
Playin' pop like follow hoods true
Baby, just sing about the groove
(Sing it)

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
(One, two, three)

Blow them horns along

The Rock Show,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/therockshow.html,"Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show

You're the Only One,Maria Mena,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariamena/youretheonlyone.html,"Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

And I probably forgot to tell you this
Like that time when I forgot to tell you about the scar
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?
See you're not what I expected
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

I hope you can forgive me for that time
When I put my hand between your legs
And said it was small
Cuz its really not at all
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down
Just to keep you around
Cuz the day that you realize how amazing you are 
You're gonna leave me

You're the only one who
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

Exactly what I mean

Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground",2004
Superman,Goldfinger,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfinger/superman.html,"So here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am
pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to keep
the ground on my feet
it seems the world's
falling down around me

The nights are all long
I'm singing this song
to try and make the answers
more than maybe

And I'm so confused
about what to do
sometimes I want 
to throw it all away

So here I am
growing older all the time
looking older all the time
feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am
pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to sleep
I lost count of the sheep
my mind is racing faster 
every minute

What could I do more
yeah I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles
but I can't quit

And I'm so confused
about what to do
sometimes I want 
to throw it all away

Controlling everything in site
I'm feeling weak
I don't feel right
you're telling me 
I have to change
telling me to act my age
but if all that I can do
is just sit and watch time go
then I'll have to say good-bye
life's too short to watch it fly
to watch it fly

So here I am
growing older all the time
looking older all the time
feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
doing everything I can
holding on to what I am

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kidrock/allsummerlong.html,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no Internet
But, man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Sweet Home Alabama
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

We were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Chariot,Gavin DeGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gavindegraw/chariot.html,"Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon ohhhh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me

[Chorus:]
Oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your...
Strength

Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a feigning to a slip
And a kickin' from the hip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie Chin and little Sammy Chong
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
We took the bow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing

Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ha
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
Make sure you have expert timing
Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...",
Parentheses,The Blow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blow/parentheses.html,"Some philosophies fuel the belief in the self
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
Built well, you're a strong letter ""I""
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
Now and then you can bend
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
You fear that you can't do it all
And you're right
Even day takes relief every day
from its work making light from the night

And when you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms

When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes

And I'll walk you outside
Through the sliding doors
Why would I mind?

If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Of course I'll put my arm around you

Scar,Missy Higgins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/missyhiggins/scar.html,"He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said ""use these down to your bones""
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought ""this one knows better than I do""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, she smelled like sugar and
Spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one, looked at my insides clicking
Her tongue and said
""This will all have to come undone""

A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,

And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

You never walk alone, and you're forever talkin on the phone.
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

I'm still waitin for your heart, cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start.
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'till then, this is all that I can say.

I'm Sticking With You,The Velvet Underground,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/velvetunderground/imstickingwithyou.html,"I'm sticking with you
'Cos I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

You held up a stagecoach in the rain
And I'm doing the same
So you're hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me

I'm sticking with you
'Cos I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

There're people going into the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing, babe, we hang past right and wrong

I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me too
I'll do anything for you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you",ompi
Flowers in the Window,Travis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/travis/flowersinthewindow.html,"When I first held you I was cold
A melting snowman I was told
But there was no one there to hold
Before I swore
That I would be alone forever more

Wow look at you now
Flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up
Out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so
Let's watch the flowers grow

There is no reason to feel bad
But there are many seasons to feel glad sad mad
It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold
But I am here to help you with the load

Wow look at you now
Flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up
Out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so
Let's watch the flowers grow

So now we're here and now is fine
So far away from there and there is time time time
To plant new seeds and watch them grow
So there'll be flowers in the window when we go

Wow look at us now
Flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up
Out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so
Let's watch the flowers grow

Oh wow look at you now
Flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up
Out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so
Let's watch the flowers grow
Let's watch the flowers grow",2001
Ordinary Day,Vanessa Carlton,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vanessacarlton/ordinaryday.html,"Just a day
Just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy
Just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky
And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize
That everyday he finds
Just what he's looking for
Like a shooting star he shines

He said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Did he ask if I would come along
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal

And he said take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy
Just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky",2002
Escapade,Janet Jackson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janetjackson/escapade.html,"As I was walkin by
Saw you standin there
With a smile
Lookin' shy
You caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang
For a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check
I'm ready to go
I promise you
I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Es-ca-pade
We'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade
Leave your worries behind
Es-ca-pade
You can be mine
Es-ca-pade
An escapade

So don't hold back
Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

My mind's tired I've worked
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made
Ready to go

Set Yourself on Fire,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/setyourselfonfire.html,"In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing [x6]
There is only one... thing

20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever...",2004

Caught in a craze, it's just a faze

Now the ice is slowly melting

Are coming around again

Of better nights and better days
Hiding in a refuge
Of memories I've made
I got a feeling within
It's coming around again

We been so long waiting
For the all time high
We got a damn good reason
To put your troubles aside
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
Throw it away
Gotta throw it away
All the colorful days my friend
Are coming around again

That's right
Yeah yeah Mmm

I got someone waiting for me
It's been so long since we met
And I may not be your salvation but I'll offer nonetheless
And if like me u wanna take that chance
It's coming around again
Ooh yeah

Yeah yeah Mmm

I can feel a change of fortune
No more riding on my love
Feel the weight is off my shoulders
As my feet become unstuck
And all the good times on which we do depend
Oh it's coming around again

Powerless (Say What You Want),Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/powerlesssaywhatyouwant.html,"Paint my face in your magazines 
Make it look whiter than it seems 
Paint me over with your dreams 
Shove away my ethnicity 
Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
And say just what is on my mind 
Without offending your might 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today 
Weatherworn, looking all the rage 
They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster 
Now itâs moccasins we sport 
We take the culture and contort 
Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
But say what you want
Say what you want

Hey you, the one, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in, get in 
Hey you, the one that donât fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in 
Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your 
Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo 
Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do
Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do
Say what you want, say what you want, say, say, say

just for you",2003

There's a glow off the pavement

In the middle of the parking lot

Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress

'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat

In this moment now capture it, remember it

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body,
I'd come into your party but I'm soft

Mutilating cat like eyes,
And in your nose blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes,

Beautiful Thing,Sister Hazel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sisterhazel/beautifulthing.html,"Well I'll follow you wherever
When you lead me by my nose
On another big adventure- I suppose
Then you lay me down in clover
With their petals on my back
I should make some time
To do more things like that...

Won't you take me to your home,
Won't you be for me forever

And just one thing...
If you're my queen...
Then it's a beautiful thing... 

Well I'm buried in my bedroom
Under fourteen feet of clothes
I could drown in all this clutter I suppose 

But then you're standing in my doorway 
With a suitcase on your back
And it blows my mind
When you do things like that

But summers free...

Do You Believe In Magic?,The Lovin' Spoonful,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lovinspoonful/doyoubelieveinmagic.html,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?

I'll be there to say 'What up' in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway
So, whatever

Higher learning
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat
The key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucka break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck?
If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your n-u-t's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end they judge me anyway
So, whatever

[Common's Speech:]
The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within
This is the journey, of the Man on the Moon",2009
Sale el Sol,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/saleelsol.html,"Estas semanas sin verte
Me parecieron aÃ±os
Tanto te quise besar
Que me duelen los labios

Mira que el miedo nos hizo
Cometer estupideces
Nos dejo sordos y ciegos
Tantas veces

Y un dia despues
De la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno
No siempre son dos
Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol

Te llore hasta el extremo
De lo que era posible
Cuando crei lo que era
Invencible
No hay mal que dure cien aÃ±os
Ni cuerpo que lo aguante
Y lo mejor siempre espera
Adelante

Y un dia despues
De la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno
No siempre son dos
Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol

Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol

Y un dia despues
De la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno no
Siempre son dos

Y un dia despues
Y un dia despues
Sale el soool

Y un dia despues
De la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos

Cuando menos piensas sale el sol",2010
Happy,Never Shout Never,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nevershoutnever/happy.html,"You make me happy, whether you know it or not
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
I am so happy
Knowin' you are the one that I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days, you're all of my days

You're lookin' so cool, you're lookin' so fly
I can't deny that when I'm starin' you down and dead in the eye
I wanna try to be the person you want the person you need
It's hard to conceive that somebody like you could be with someone like me

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
Ooh-ooh

You're lookin' so fresh, it's catchin' my eye
Why oh why did I not see this before
The girl I adore was right in front of me
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
And ask why it took so long to see we're meant to be

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
On the good, the bad, the ugly
The smiles, the laughs, the funny
Oh, the things we put each other through
It's for you, for you, for you

You make me happy, whether you know it or not
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
I am so happy
Knowin' you are the one that I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days

I'm happy knowin' that you are mine

Fumble,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/fumble.html,"Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
I set her straight, it's not based on your life. 

There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight. 

No need to be uncalm, 
We'll leave it by the phone, 
A message you can swallow, 
A letter to sign, 
No need to be alarmed, 
We'll leave this all alone, 
And all the guilt will follow you in a line. 

There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight",2003

Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend

I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around

Pace yourself for me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now
When all I wanna do is try

Once Around the Block,Badly Drawn Boy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/badlydrawnboy/oncearoundtheblock.html,"You quiver like a candle on fire
I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
But I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while

You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the inside
There's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I'm got to search out for your clues

I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift that I stole from
just wanting to live
Now I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise

Trying to outrun your fear
Your running to lose, heart on your sleeve
And your soul in your shoes
Take a left, a sharp left
And another left, meet me on the corner
And we'll start again",2000

Common People,Pulp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pulp/commonpeople.html,"She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College,
That's where I
Caught her eye. 

She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, ""In that case I'll have a rum and coca-cola.""
She said, ""Fine,""
And in thirty seconds time
She said,

""I want to live like common people.
I want to do whatever common people do,
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you.""

Well, what else could I do? 
I said, ""I'll see what I can do.""

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it
Somewhere,
So it started there. 

I said, ""Pretend you've got no money,""
She just laughed and said, ""Oh, you're so funny.""
I said, ""Yeah?
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here."" 

Are you sure you want to live like common people?
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people, 
You want to sleep with common people like me. 

But she didn't understand,
She just smiled and held my hand. 

Rent a flat above a shop,
Cut your hair and get a job. 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school. 

But still you'll never get it right 
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching 'roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all. 

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
And dance and drink and screw 
Because there's nothing else to do. 

Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do. 
Because you think that poor is cool. 

I want to live with common people like you,
I want to live with common people like you [etc..]",1995
Elevator Love Letter,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/elevatorloveletter.html,"I'm so hard for a rich girl
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
And I don't know how to love
I get so tired after midday, lately
I take it out on my good friends
But the worst stays in, or where would I begin?

My office glows all night long
Its a nuclear show, and the stars are gone
Elevator, Elevator, take me home

I'm so hot for the rich girl
Her heels so high, and my hopes so low
'Cause I don't know how to love
I'll take her home after midnight
And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
How we'll be in love by the morning
I don't think she knows
That I'm saying good bye

My office glows all night long
Its a nuclear show, and the stars are gone
Elevator, Elevator, take me home

My office glows all night long
Its a nuclear show, and the stars are gone
Elevator, Elevator, take me home

Requiem for O.M.M.2,of Montreal,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ofmontreal/requiemforomm2.html,"When I met you, I was just a kid -- hadn't built up my defenses.
So I gave my heart completely -- Vaseline all over the lenses.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer.
And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life.
I just had to let you go...",2005

Here Comes My Baby,Cat Stevens,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catstevens/herecomesmybaby.html,"In the midnight moonlight I'll be walking a long and lonely mile.
And every time I do, I keep seeing this picture of you.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

You never walk alone, and you're forever talking on the phone.
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

I'm still waiting for your heart, cuz I'm sure that some day it's gonna start.
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'til then this is all that I can say.

Here's comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.

To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?

I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you could have attained
Why try anything?
I will get there, just remember I know

You didnt even know my name 
So I walked on pretending that you still belong

And its quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs 
Its getting darker and I know time wasnt meant for us

Its like finding something pretty energized and 
If you want just hide your eyes behind your head

Caring Is Creepy,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/caringiscreepy.html,"I think I'll go home and mull this over
Before I cram it down my throat
At long last it's crashed, it's colossal mass
Has broken up into bits in my moat

Lift the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off
Go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin
Hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade
Far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And the whole mess of roads we're now on

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond my remote concern
Of being condescending

All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond my remote concern
Of being condescending

All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks",2001

Cause I'm not the only one 
No, I'm not the only one

I can't stay very far 
I can't stay much longer 
Riding my decision home

There is a little boy in her arms 
Now we'll parade around without game plans 
Obligation or alarm

Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Dont stand me up
Don't let me down
I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold..

Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
She's just in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel",2006

Landed,Ben Folds,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/landed.html,"We'd hit the bottom,
I thought it was my fault
And in a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about

Moved to the west coast away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still, I was still in love

Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up...I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
Until I believed I was the crazy one, 
and in a way
I guess I was...

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading a sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

If you wrote me off I'd understand it
Because I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up...
I've landed

And you will be so
happy to know
I've come alone,
it's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's by my goodbye I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's OK to call
Now I'll answer for myself

Come pick me up,
...I've landed",2005
Sleep All Day,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/sleepallday.html,"His after moan though cries oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here And time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons, oh, time to end the pain
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
Why don't we?

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us
and we knew it was time to take a chance here
and time to compromise our lives just a little while
and it was time for all the wrong reasons
but time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun
to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines
then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
and they knew it was time, time to take a chance here
time to compromise our little lives just a little while
and they knew it was time for all the wrong and, lonely, lonesome reasons, oh
as time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done

The Fear,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/thefear.html,"I want to be rich and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
I heard people die while they are trying to find them

And I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous.

[Pre-chorus:]
I'll look at the sun and I'll look in the mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm on to a winner.

[Chorus:]
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic

And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault it's how I'm programmed to function

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner
Now everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner

Heartbreak, cigarettes and songs, with a winters chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter, and a run away

Footloose,Kenny Loggins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennyloggins/footloose.html,"Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Oh, tell me what I got

I've got this feeling
That times are holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oo-wee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

Yeah, ooooh-oh-oh

(Second) And put your feet on the ground
(Third) Now take the hold of all

I'm turning it loose footloose,
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Footloose) footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees

I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

Dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie

And the people, passin' by
Stare in wild wonder
And the inside juke-box
Roars out just like thunder

And ev'rything looks so complete
When you walk out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

M79,Vampire Weekend,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vampireweekend/m79.html,"It's going to take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79

Wasted days you've come to pass

So go I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor

Coronation rickshaw grab

So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass

Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass",2008
This Love,Maroon 5,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maroon5/thislove.html,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered ""Goodbye"", she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me

Somewhere Only We Know,Keane,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/keane/somewhereonlyweknow.html,"I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?

Summer of '69,Bryan Adams,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bryanadams/summerof69.html,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard.
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you've got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah.
Back in the summer of '69, oh.

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no! yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah.
Back in the summer of '69, oh.
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah.
Me and my baby in '69, oh.
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.",1984
It's My Life,Bon Jovi,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bonjovi/itsmylife.html,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed

I ain't gonna live forever

For Tommy and Gina who never backed down

Slap you on the back and say, ""Please, please""

But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?

Fluorescent Adolescent,Arctic Monkeys,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcticmonkeys/fluorescentadolescent.html,"You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again.

I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me",2003

Let it die

We'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by

I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky
And keep pretending the sun will not rise 
Be together for one more night
Somewhere, somehow

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away",2003
Fight Test,The Flaming Lips,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/flaminglips/fighttest.html,"I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
I thought it better not to fight
I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
So when it came time to fight,
I thought I'll just step aside and that the time would prove you wrong
And that you would be the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery

Oh to fight is to defend if it's not now than tell me when
Would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
For to lose I could accept, but to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment
Oh that I, I was the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life,
It's all a mystery

Cause I'm a man not a boy and there are things you can't avoid,
You have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
If I could, I would, but you're with him now it'd do no good
I should have fought him but instead I let him-
I let him take it

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what right for his own life
It's all a mystery",2002

Is This Love?,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/clapyourhandssayyeah/isthislove.html,"You're so much different than me yea
I know
And I'm my only enemy
Pain is all that I can see oh

I see you're climbing a tree
And I know
That it's easier to be up high in
The air than oh the ground
And it's love, etc.

You say you can't say anymore
You've already said it before
In a million different ways which
Were all not quite right
The rain is loud on the ground
Well I know
But I don't even make a sound when
I come around oh
And you say I'd be better off dead
This I know
But it's no use hiding this pretty
Head in the ground
And it's love, etc.

And we can do the zarathustra
We can do the broken fist
We can tear down all the borders
Or abbreviate the list
And when finally the finish line
Emerges from the mist we'll sound
A soft alarm",2005
Back in Your Head,Tegan and Sara,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/teganandsara/backinyourhead.html,"Build a wall of books 
Between us in our bed 
Repeat, repeat the words 
That I know we both said 
Relax into the need 
We get so comfortable 
Remember when I was 
So strange and likeable 
I just want back in your head 
I just want back in your head 
I'm not unfaithful 
But I'll stray 
When I get a little scared 
When I get a little scared 
When I get a little 
When I jerk away from 
Holding hands with you 
I know these habits hurt 
Important parts of you 
Remember when I was
Sweet and unexplainable 
Nothing like this person, 
Unlovable 
I just want back in your head 
I just want back in your head 
I'm not unfaithful 
But I'll stray 
When I get a little scared 
When I get a little scared 
When I get a little scared

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes

Going to the candidates' debate
Laugh about it, shout about it

Songbird,Oasis,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/songbird.html,"Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone",2002
Rome,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/rome.html,"Whoâs the boy you like the most
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow
Single in his bed someday
Quiet till it falls falls falls

Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! what did I say? what can I say?
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
Iâll be driving, you look the other way

It ainât easy to ignore
When your shutters are open all the way
When itâs candlelight I see I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict till it falls, falls, falls

Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! what did I say? what can I say?
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
Iâll be driving, you look the other way

Always and forevermore
I call to say Iâm on the way
2000 years remain in a trash can
Let burn the cigarette somewhere
Ashes till it falls, falls, falls

I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I canât do without
The futureâs trying to wait
Iâve never loved you
And if I loved you
I wouldnât say that Iâm sorry oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves

Always and forevermore
Weâre together dead and lonely
I thought I couldnât do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes till it falls, falls, falls",2009
Junk of the Heart (Happy),The Kooks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kooks/junkofthehearthappy.html,"Junk of the heart is junk in my mind
So hard to leave you all alone
We get so drunk that we can hardly see
What use to that to you or me, baby?
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

We sink to be sunk, but life is no race
When I'm not happy I'm in disgrace
So I spend time with guessing on you
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night

Firework,Katy Perry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/firework.html,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through, -ough, -ough

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Kissing the Lipless,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/kissingthelipless.html,"Called to see if your back
Was still aligned and your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed

But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You told us of your new life there
You got someone comin' around
Gluing tinsel to your crown
He's got you talking pretty loud
You berate remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
You say you're still in love
If it's true what can be done
It's hard to leave all those moments behind

Called to see if your back
Was still aligned and your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed

But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You tested your metal of doe's skin and petals
While kissing the lipless
Who bleed all the sweetness away",2003
Everythings Just Wonderful,Lily Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilyallen/everythingsjustwonderful.html,"Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental,
It seems to me that it's spiraling outta control and it's inevitable,
Now don't you think,
This time is yours, this time is mine,
It's temperamental,
It seems to me, we're on all fours,
Crawling on our knees,
Someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ almighty,
Do I feel alright? No not slightly,
I wanna get a flat I know I can't afford it,
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage,
Well it's very funny cos I got your fucking money,
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble,
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

[Chorus]
Oh yes, I'm fine,
Everything's just wonderful,
I'm having the time of my life.

Don't you want something else,
Something new, than what we've got here,
And don't you feel it's all the same,
Some sick game and it's not insincere,
I wish I could change the ways of the world,
Make it a nice place
Until that day, I guess we stay,
Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw

Why can't I sleep at night,
Don't say it's gonna be alright,
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognaise,
and not feel bad about it for days and days and days.
In the magazines they talk about weight loss,
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss,
Oh no it's not the life I chose,
But I guess that's the way that things go,

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [etc.]

Do I feel alright? No not slightly,

As licky as trips
I can't lick that far
But when you pout
The way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

And when I see you
Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say I'll keep on holding you in
My arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah as smitten as that
I can't get that small
The way you fur
The how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make-believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave

And when I see you
Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I know I'll keep on holding you
In arms so tight
They'll never let you go",1992
Fell Down The Stairs,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/felldownthestairs.html,"You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
For two drunk kids trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
But eventually the sky did return and I was there outside in green
I watched the world being reborn until one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know it was beautiful slow dancing
To tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love just like blood will always stain
And if I could reverse it I don't think it would be worth it
I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
No, I'll never let you go
I will never let you tumble to the ground
I'll never let you go
I will never let you tumble to the ground
I'll never let you go",2004

She fell in love with the drummer
Another and another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned

Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears

I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer

The mistake you don't make or the rain cloud covers above your house

Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
But it's 5!
It's 5!

Can I ride with you until the sunset gets all red?
And we'll get chased by the moon

Hope the passion don't fade since you decided he's your spouse
Wheeling, dealing, joking things will change, girl

Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,

It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

We gonna stimulate your mind
Everybody's high
Eyes just like a child
Everything feels right

Once you've seen the light
You're gonna move all night
Feel your soul ignite
Everything feels right, right, riggggggggghht

We live the masterful life that's mythical
Feel its chords and its vibes atypical
Do what you want
It's alright this mystical time you've got
That's a lot of this principle

If you stay in this moments so critical
Let the music change your brain stem's chemicals
Make you feel like your spirit's invincible
Force centrifugal reaching up to your pinnacle now

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

We rock like Colorado
You're at it throwin' bottles
We give a fuck about who your status
Who you are tomorrow
Whether you beg or borrow
Or hit the super lotto
Whether your girl look like a minga or a supermodel

Feel the connectedness, energy, disprojected the weighted
The whole collective consciousness
Arise like helium oh
Groovin' out of the question
Won't disrespect him, but
Our styles fuckin' pouch like Dave Beckham c'mon

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down

The truth I'm at 'em and rough 'em
As hard as the granite get
Never hesitant upon a mic strike, quick
Like an avalanche
Hijack ya like a Comanche
I'm a man on a mission
Rhyme vigilante
Keep all the jealous and the envious antsy
Love to do the club though with the party people dancin' uh-huh
And set the mood for all the plottin' and romancin' uh-huh

It's a wonderful night
We've got the answer c'mon
It's a wonderful night
You've gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You've gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night

Come on and break it on down",2004

North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA

This is what I'd say

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie come back to me, oh

Yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, honey, the blues

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me, honey pie

Hold on Tight,Electric Light Orchestra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/electriclightorchestra/holdontight.html,"Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see your ship go sailing
When you feel your heart is breaking
Hold tight to your dream.

It's a long time to be gone
Time just rolls on and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold tight to your dream

[CHORUS:]
When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over & over & over you could

Accroches-toi a ton reve
Accroches-toi a ton reve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sents -- ton coeur se briser
Accroches-toi a ton reve.

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream.

Hold on tight to your dream
Yeah, hold on tight...

Don't Get Me Wrong,The Pretenders,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pretenders/dontgetmewrong.html,"Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in awhile
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the 'mode of passion'
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong",1986

now I feel ok I hope it can stay- this way 

You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end
You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end 
Are these the good days that I've heard so much about-
there goes the heartbreak that I can live without 
I've been so frustrated, bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted all the things I've got
But now that you are here this anger disappears
and I feel happy too this is sappy but it's true

The Bird and The Worm,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/thebirdandtheworm.html,"If you're the bird
Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
I know the part, it's such a bummer

But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine
(Feel the shine)
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast a line
(Well, I'll try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
(It depends)
As they arrive
(If they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well,
Who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears

If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make
Each other blush
(you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well,
Who needs anemones?

You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

We were meant to be
We were meant to be

If you're the bird,
Then I'm the worm)

Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carlyraejepsen/callmemaybe.html,"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

So call me, maybe?

Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'

Everytime We Touch,Cascada,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cascada/everytimewetouch.html,"I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch in my dream.
(in my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why,
Without you, it's hard to survive.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
(that I cry)
The good and the bad times: we've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

The Saltwater Room,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/thesaltwaterroom.html,"I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

June Afternoon,Roxette,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/juneafternoon.html,"Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this deja vu? 
Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, Bar-B-Q. 
Look at all the people, happy faces all around. 
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds 

It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun. 
Get your green, green tambourine, let's play in the park. 
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun 

Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming 
and reaching for their food. 
Let's go buy an ice-cream and a magazine with an attitude 
and put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star 
cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la 

It's a bright June afternoon... 

There's a painter painting his masterpiece. 
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees, 
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon. 
All my life I've longed for this afternoon.",

Opportunity,Pete Murray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petemurray/opportunity.html,"And so it goes another lonely day
You're savin' time but you're miles away
Your fly was drownin' in some bitter tea
For seeing lost opportunity

Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide
Don't go kid yourself well not today
The satisfaction's not too far away

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but you're here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
And never miss opportunity

Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

You fell for me so I'll stay the same for you 

Oh yeah I know that I'm not perfect baby 
Oh yeah it's no reason to go crazy 
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me 
For better or for worse I will always put you first 

Now that I have found you 
You've changed my life 
Cos you're the one who showed me 
I have everything right 
We're never gonna differ cos we know it's true 
So don't change me and I won't change you 

I used to change my style like I changed my mind 
I tried to change a tyre but I'm not that way inclined 
Tried to change my figure my diet too 
I'll still change my underwear if that's O.K with you 
But after seeing you I know that here is best 

Oh yeah the world can sometimes make you feel bad 
Oh yeah but don't forget the things you have 
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me 
In sickness and in health baby always be yourself",2003

Bring It All Back,S Club 7,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sclub7/bringitallback.html,"Bring it all back now

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you

Hold on to what you try to be
Your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders
Just smile and let it go
If people try to put you down
Just walk on by don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself

Don't you know it's true what they say
That life, it ain't easy
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you

Na na na na..

Try not to worry 'bout a thing
Enjoy the good times life can bring
Keep it all inside you
Gotta let the feeling show
Imagination is the key
'Cos you are your own destiny
You never should be lonely
When time is on your side

Don't you know it's true what they say
Things are sent to try you
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

Don't stop, never give up

On Top of the World,Imagine Dragons,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/imaginedragons/ontopoftheworld.html,"If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here
'cause they just may run away from you

You'll never know quite when, well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but life keeps moving

I take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then
but then again I couldn't have
'cause I've traveled all this way for something

I take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can

I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

The Rhythm,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/therhythm.html,"And for all of the sweet loving that
I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your soul?'

Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along:

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
'why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'

And she'll show you some rhythm

And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place
And continue to:
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and
Continue to -
She said I'll show you some rhythm

And she'll show you some rhythm",2003
County Line,Sugarland,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugarland/countyline.html,"There's a place I like to go
Cherry bombs and cherry wine
Just past the Texaco
Down on the county line

Beer cans and cemeteries
Spanish moss on a welcome sign
Catch a buzz, we all get scared
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Kettle corn and 4H fairs
Pink slips and white wall tires
Bet you twenty I'll beat you there
Down on the county line

It's first love and football wars
A French kiss and battle cries
Further then I've been before
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

All the church yards and whitewash fences
All the widows and teenage brides
We're all searching for redemption
We're all looking for a sign

Down on the county line (down on the county line)
Down on the county line (down on the county line)

The best things in life are free
It's been right here all the time
It's everything that's home to me
Down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find you
Out where you leave em all behind
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Out where your troubles can't find ya
Out where we have a real good time
Out where the moon shines sweetly
Won't you meet me down on the county line

Eye Know,De La Soul,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delasoul/eyeknow.html,"[POS:]
Greetings, girl, and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[DOVE:]
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

(Eye know Eye love you better)

[POS:]
Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

(Eye know I love you better)

[DOVE:]
It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee,
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two,
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Basket Case,Green Day,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/basketcase.html,"Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything
All at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said ""My life's a bore""
So quit my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

I'm carrying the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
this is how we feel

Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep

Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you 'bout it

The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket costs only your mind
The driver said, 'Hey man, we go all the way.'
Of course we were willing to pay

My name is Wepeel
I got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still makin' noise (makin' noise)

Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else?

Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah!

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

If I Ever Feel Better,Phoenix,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/phoenix/ifieverfeelbetter.html,"They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life I can't control

They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait...

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away

Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive

I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

If I ever feel better

Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree
And I'd 'a danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.

New slang when you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries.
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony.
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall,
Never should have called
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely.

God speed all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs,
And bleed into their buns 'til they melt away.

I'm looking in on the good life I might be doomed never to find.
Without a trust or flaming fields am I too dumb to refine?

Stay with the all unknown
Stay away from the hooks
All the chances we took

We're so close 
To something better left unknown
We're so close 
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones
Oh seriously, 
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on baby play me something 
Like here comes the sun
[x2]

Come on baby play me something

Happy Hour,The Housemartins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/housemartins/happyhour.html,"It's happy hour again
I think I might be happy if I wasn't out with them
And they're happy, it's a lovely place to be
Happy that the fire is real, the barman is a she

Where the haircuts smile
And the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose
And it's them who choose
And if you don't win then you've lost

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)

It's another night out with the boss
Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right they will land upon their knees

Where they open all their wallets
And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And as we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And back to the kitchen sink

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, don't believe it (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again",1986
Hotel Yorba,The White Stripes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/hotelyorba.html,"I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me don't move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
To the beauty I had found

Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'til we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gonna worry about locking the door

Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say ""I do"" at least

Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

And it's 4 5 6 7
Grab your umbrella
Grab a hold of me
'Cause I'm your favourite fella
All they got inside is vacancy",2001

It's Not Unusual,Tom Jones,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomjones/itsnotunusual.html,"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
I wanna die

It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find
That you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you",1965
Breakdown,Jack Johnson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/breakdown.html,"I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now I...

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down

This engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time
That I got to get to
Where I don't need to be
So I

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now",2005
Kodachrome,Paul Simon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulsimon/kodachrome.html,"When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder
I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall

Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's
a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together
for one night
I know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse
in black and white",1973

That he doesn't really understand

No Stopping Us,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/nostoppingus.html,"Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you?
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you

Will you help me break it down and get on thru

Down to the other side
Its easy of you only try
We don't lie down on the job
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us

Should I address all my letters to the well to be
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done
Should I better not take it so personall if all the good loving is never received
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice

No not i..
See its easy if you only try
We don't lie down on the job
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us.

I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
I promise to make it worth your while

So c'mon try. Baby wont you try

I was lying In my bed

Than one or two

Comin' from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do
When it's late in the evening
And the music s seeping through

The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shootin pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage In this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
myself a ""J""
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began
to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away
The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you
And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through",ound

I dont know
Higher now than ever before 
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now
Watch it go

On the back of a hurricane 
That started turning

When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water
It ain't so sweet
You dont have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to 
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness

Flowers on the Wall,The Statler Brothers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/statlerbrothers/flowersonthewall.html,"I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're giving me is conscience, I guess
If I were walking in your shoes I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying about me, I'm having lots of fun

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do
Don't tell me I've nothing to do",1966

This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like yeah
Movin' my hips like yeah
I got my hands up
They're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be OK
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song,

Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me every time (every time)

We Will Become Silhouettes,The Postal Service,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/wewillbecomesilhouettes.html,"I've got a cupboard with cans of food, filtered water,
And pictures of you and I'm not coming out
Until this is all over
And I'm looking through the glass where the light bends
At the cracks
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs pretending
The echoes belong to someone
Someone I used to know

And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...

I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet,
But all the news reports recommended that
I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make our cells
Divide at an alarming rate until our shells
Simply cannot hold all our insides in,
And that's when we'll explode
(and it won't be a pretty sight)

And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...

And we'll become
And we'll become",2003
Thank You,Dido,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/thankyou.html,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Get The Party Started,Pink,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/getthepartystarted.html,"I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lot of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruisin' through the west side
We'll be checkin' the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says Stunner #1 Superstar

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
Get this party started

Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chilling as I set up the groove
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

Joy to the World,Three Dog Night,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/threedognight/joytotheworld.html,"Jeremiah was a bull frog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine

Singin'
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you

Singin' now
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider
A straight-shootin' son of a gun
I said a straight shootin' son of a gun

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world

you won't stop making sense
But my tongue still misbehaves and it
keeps digging my own grave with my

I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
the best thing that I have
Well, it makes it easier to know
exactly what I want with my...

Hands open and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
that your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

Put Sufjan Stevens on
and we'll play your favorite song

The Sign,Ace of Base,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aceofbase/thesign.html,"I, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
Why, why do I bother
When you're not the one for me
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

Mariella,Kate Nash,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katenash/mariella.html,"I'm heavy handed
To say the least
My mother thinks
I'll be an awful clutcher
'Cause I spill things from stirring 'em too quickly
I'm far too loud
It's like, as soon as I've got an opinion
It just has to come out
I laugh at stupid things
Just 'cause they tickle me

And
Sometimes I wish
Sometimes I wish I was like Mariella
She got some prittstick
And she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak
Never had to speak
Never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse
She just doesn't make a peep

She marched to her wardrobe
And threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious
But it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby
In patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms
And so she cried for hours

Mariella, Mariella
My pretty baby girl
Unglue your lips from being together and
And wear some pink and pearls
You can have your friends 'round
And they can stay for tea
Won't you just try to fit in please
Do this for me

But Mariella just crossed her arms
As she walked up the stairs
And she went into her bedroom
And she sat on her bed
And she looked in the mirror
And she thought to herself
""If I wanna play, I can play with me
If I wanna think, I'll think in my head""

At school, Mariella didn't have many friends
Yeah the girls they all looked at her
And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase.
But Mariella just smiled as she skipped down the road
Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yes, she always got the crossword puzzle right everyday
And she could do the alphabet backwards
Without making any mistakes

Mariella, Mariella
Pretty, pretty girl
Mariella, Mariella
Happy in her own little world
Happy in her own little world

And she said
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together
She said I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah I'm never ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together",2007
Music Is the Victim,Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/musicisthevictim.html,"I left my heart in San Fransisco 
I'ts at some motherfucking disco 
The people there where dancin' on it 
And that's including Ms. Matronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then som am I 

Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my bag in Pasadena 
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
Them bitches sure where crunked up on it 
I said I'd rather smoke som chronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then som am I 

Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my man in Houston Texas 
Just before he finished breakfast 
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 

Hell if Jesus had the power than so do I 
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
If music is the victim then so am I",2004
Girl All the Bad Guys Want,Bowling for Soup,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bowlingforsoup/girlallthebadguyswant.html,"8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin' 
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me. 
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring, 
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means. 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She doesn't notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange 
Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad 
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty 
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She'll never notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

She likes 'em with a mustache 
Racetrack season pass 
Drivin' in a Trans-Am 
Does a mullet make a man? 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

There she goes again 
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair 
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated 
All I wanted was to see her naked! 

Now I am watchin' wrestling 
Tryin' to be a tough guy 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in my eyes 
I can't grow a mustache 
And I ain't got no season pass 
All I got's a moped...moped....moped..... 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 

She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
(There she goes again) 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
(There she goes again) 
She's the girl all the bad guys want!

Love Love Love,Tristan Prettyman,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tristanprettyman/lovelovelove.html,"Well, it's 4 AM,
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?

And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.

'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.

And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.

With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.

And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
Cause when I'm here I'm always something.

This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.",2005

Put out the fire
Don't look past my shoulder

Sit and lose

Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe

Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
(Say what)
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future",2001
I Want to Break Free,Queen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/queen/iwanttobreakfree.html,"I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you

I've fallen in love for the first time

And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey

Ray of Light,Madonna,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/madonna/rayoflight.html,"[Verse:]
Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus:]

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[chorus]

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[verse]

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else shall be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light I'm flying",1998
Chocolate,Snow Patrol,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/chocolate.html,"This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw, final straw in the
Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time

You're the only thing that I love
It scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth I'm lost for words

What have I done it's too late for that
What have I become truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask...this time",2003
Turn To Stone,Electric Light Orchestra,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/electriclightorchestra/turntostone.html,"The city streets are empty now THE LIGHTS DON'T SHINE NO MORE
and so the songs are way down low TURNING TURNING TURNING
A sound that flows into my mind THE ECHOES OF THE DAYLIGHT
of everything that is alive IN MY BLUE WORLD

I turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.
Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.

The dying embers of the night A FIRE THAT SLOWLY FADES TILL DAWN
still glow upon the wall so bright BURNING BURNING BURNING
The tired streets that hide away FROM HERE TO EVERYWHERE THEY GO
roll past my door into the day IN MY BLUE WORLD

I turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.
Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.
Turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.

Yes, I'm turnin' to stone 'cos you ain't comin' home.
Why you ain't comin' home if I'm turnin' to stone?
You've been gone for so long and I can't carry on,
yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin', I'm turnin' to stone.

The dancing shadows on the wall THE TWO-STEP IN THE HALL
are all I see since you've been gone TURNING TURNING TURNING
Through all I sit here and I wait I TURN TO STONE I TURN TO STONE
You will return again some day TO MY BLUE WORLD

I turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.
Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.
Turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.

I turn to stone when you are gone, I turn to stone.
Turn to stone when you comin' home, I can't go on.

Rumours say that you're very sorry.

If You Got the Money,Jamie T,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiet/ifyougotthemoney.html,"If you got the money,
I think it would be funny
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

An' all the boys they go:
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...

I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gum
While a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.

'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody the sound of spit
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
So toot what took man choke on it

We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?

Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap

If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free

With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead

Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter

With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

Move outta' the way man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
(I've been watching you)

Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money

I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me

Let the good times roll let the good times roll,
Cowgirl king of the rodeo let the good times roll,

Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day, 'cause they are

Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) But you don't really wanna go

You're hot then you're cold

Human,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/human.html,"I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought but I was kind

And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Hear my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could

And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've gotta let me go

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

You've gotta let me know

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Are we human or are we dancer?
Are we human or are we dancer?",2008
Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/waitingontheworldtochange.html,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change",2006
Do It,Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/doit.html,"You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't want to

[CHORUS:]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me just open up
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back
'cause you know this thing could spiral in the night
I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time

Drops of Jupiter,Train,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/train/dropsofjupiter.html,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting starâ
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey (mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey (yeah)

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation?
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?

And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
And did you fall for a shooting star, fall for a shooting star?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there",2001

Know Your Onion!,The Shins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shins/knowyouronion.html,"Shut out, pimpled and angry.
I quietly tied all my guts into knots.
Gave up on trying to make them,
I figured it'd take them too long to look up and besides...

It was undeniably clear to me i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew what worthless dregs we've always been.

Lucked out and found my favorite records
Lying in wait at the birmingham mall.
The songs that i heard,
The occasional book
Were the only fun i ever took.
And i got on with making myself.
The trick is just making yourself.

But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight...

Three thousand miles north east
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads.
""what kind of life you dream of? you're allergic to love.""
Yes i know but i must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me, i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are,
The selfless, loving saints we are,
The melting, sliding dice we've always been.",2001

It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine),R.E.M.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/itstheendoftheworldasweknowitandifeelfine.html,"That's great! It starts with an earthquake,
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;
and Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.
World serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs.
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no strength.
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down height.
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site.
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck.

Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
Look at that low plane! Fine, then.
Uh oh, overflow, population, Common Food,
But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right.
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light;
Feeling pretty psyched.

It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

Six o'clock. TV hour.
Don't get caught in foreign tower.
Slash and burn, return,
Listen to yourself churn.
Lock him in uniform and book burning, bloodletting.
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.
Light a candle, light a votive.
Step down, step down.
Watch a heel crush, crush.
Uh oh, this means no fear; cavalier.
Renegade and steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament,
A tournament of lies.
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline.

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
I feel fine

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

The other night I tripped a nice
Continental drift divide.
Mountains sit in a line.
Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev,
Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly beans, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right? (Right!)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

Hum Hallelujah,Fall Out Boy,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/falloutboy/humhallelujah.html,"It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this

The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew, 'cause it's hell on the engine 
You are the dreamer and we are the dream.
I could write it better than you ever felt it.

So hum hallelujah,
Just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you
It was just how you looked in the light.
A teenage vow in a parking lot
""Till tonight do us part""
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith to hell with our good name.
A remix of your guts-your insides X-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills.
I could write it better than you ever felt it. 

So hum hallelujah,
Just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you

Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping hitting my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind!

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug

But left to my own devices,

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My sleaze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a love sick crack head

The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug?
Your drug?
Huh, your drug?
Huh, your drug?
Is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug

The West coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

I wish they all could be California

You've Got the Love,Florence + the Machine,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/florencethemachine/youvegotthelove.html,"Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying, ""Lord, I just don't care.""
But you've got the love I need To see me through

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know my Saviour's love is real
You know it's real

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think, ""Oh, Lord, what's the use?""
Time after time I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you lose
But you got the love I need to see me through

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Don't wait, turn me away

A Well Respected Man,The Kinks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kinks/awellrespectedman.html,"'Cause he gets up in the morning,
And he goes to work at nine,
And he comes back home at five-thirty,
Gets the same train every time.
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality,
It never fails.

And he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And his mother goes to meetings,
While his father pulls the maid,
And she stirs the tea with councilors,
While discussing foreign trade,
And she passes looks, as well as bills
At every suave young man

'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And he likes his own backyard,
And he likes his fags the best,
'Cause he's better than the rest,
And his own sweat smells the best,
And he hopes to grab his father's loot,
When Pater passes on.

'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.

And he plays at stocks and shares,
And he goes to the Regatta,
And he adores the girl next door,
'Cause he's dying to get at her,
But his mother knows the best about
The matrimonial stakes.

'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.",1965

I wake up
The taste of summer sweetness on my mind

In this city
Let's go dance under the street lights
All the people in this world
Let's come together
More than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it

Come on over
Down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
Can't you feel that sunshine telling you to hold tight
Things will be alright
Try to find a better life
Come on over
Down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers there for one another
Come on over
Man I know you wanna let yourself go

Some people
It's a pity
They go all their lives and never know
How to love or to let love go
But it's alright now
We'll make it through this somehow
And we'll paint the perfect picture
All the colors of this world will run together more than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it

But here and now this is our time
And I may never find the meaning of life

'What do you to survive?'
He said 'oh my dear listen here'
And this is what he cried

On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
'Dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy

My knees they've got some cuts and bruises
From skating all my days
When I'm skating with my friends
My troubles drift away

I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
I like to move around
Cos getting down and jumping up
These are some good things that I found

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin

My waist it's got a slinky belt
With a clip that's quick to open
Because loving is the sweetest thing
And from my waist it happen

And my stomachs got some tasty food
That's making me feel good
Cos sharing some meals is something
I wish the world could do

And my chest it wears a singlet
Ah my chest it beating proud
My chest suggest I am a man
That no institution can knock down
And around my neck is superstition
Hanging from a chain
Because I've got my gods but in the end
I make my own way

Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin

And my mouth it's got a great big smile
That shows some great big teeth
To friends it brings a happiness
And to enemies it brings defeat

And my eyes they've got some vision
That can see through many lies
Ah my eyes they look for better things
The better things to see in life

And my ears are wearing head phones
That do play my favourite songs
Not music I'm told to like
But the songs that make me dance along

Cos on my feet are shoes for dancing
'Dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy

Happy Jack,The Who,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/who/happyjack.html,"Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

The kids couldn't hurt Jack

They dropped things on his back

Fire With Fire,Scissor Sisters,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scissorsisters/firewithfire.html,"You can see that you're being surrounded
From every direction
And love was just something you found
To add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one
But now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from
Some blazing arrows yesterday
You said, ""Fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire.""
Now the city blacks out the sun
That you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done
Your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone
Hiding out between the lines
What will we be when we come undone
Just a simple meeting of the minds?
And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
Underneath your skies
There's a million lights
Burning brightly just like fireflies
It's cold and heaven surrounds you from every direction
'Cause there's someone behind every hand
That you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
We've got a reason to be holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today
And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire

Fishies,The Cat Empire,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/catempire/fishies.html,"I left the house left the room with the foxy on my back
And my supplies in a magic pack
And I followed the sound of music
Not up a hill â¦ but down to an old wharf shack

Inside I heard the trumpets call
I salute to the champions on the wall
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced

And the night she looked so fine to me
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
And so tie me to the mast I must believe!

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite
Still I kept the sight of my desire

And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
Lights dimmed but she shone like mythology
And I must admit she felt so alive

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook

She waves for everybody down on the floor
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
And there we were in the depths of the wild below

Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
She whispered 'wait for the trumpets call'
It's not exactly love it's to adore 

Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook",2007

Run and hide Sunday girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams Sunday girl

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home Sunday girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl

When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

I stay away all week and still I wait

What your loving means to me

Hurry up

I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

Why I'm a stranger in my own life

Gonna mail it to my local D.J.

I want my jockey to play

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo

Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop

What If I'm Right,Sandi Thom,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sandithom/whatifimright.html,"You'll take me on a journey
And be there till the end
It won't be an uphill struggle
On you I can depend

You promised me a dream home
With roses round the door
You'll cover me in diamonds
There's nothing I want more
And
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true and be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?

'cos if the rain starts falling
You'll protect me with your coat
And you'll always tape the football
And let me watch my soap

You'll always be as handsome
And your weight will never gain
And when I give birth to our children
I will feel no pain
And
You'll bring me flowers
And you'll run me showers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?

You'll always keep the magic
The tender love and care
And when you need to change the light bulb
You wont hand me the chair
And when we're tired of the city
And we find a country home
You'll sell your vinyl records
And go get us a loan

You'll be my sympathetic lover
And won't steal the covers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You won't forsake me
Your mother won't hate me
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true
And be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?",2006
Smile Upon Me,Passion Pit,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/passionpit/smileuponme.html,"Everything's always better
Whenever I am undressed
I'm wound up tighter than
A dried up birds nest

And it's truth, you know
It's always the issue
And when it starts getting blurry
One's never better than two

There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

Oh yeah, you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too

I don't know what are you now
Since everything's changed
If I did know one thing
It's me who's feeling strange

Yes, everything is different
And I don't react well
The changes that come when
Your life's becoming hell

There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

Oh yeah, you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too

There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

Oh yeah, you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too",P:  
Holiday From Real,Jack's Mannequin,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacksmannequin/holidayfromreal.html,"She thinks I'm much too thin
She asks me if I'm sick
What's a girl to do 
With friends like this
She lets me drive her car 
So I can score an eighth
From the lesbians 
Out west in Venice

Oh, California in the Summer
Ah, and my hair is growing long
Fuck yeah, we can live like this

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains 
And say it's so much fun out here
But when it's all over
I'll come back for another year

I'll look for work today
I'm spilling out the door
Put my glasses on 
So no one sees me
I never thought that
I'd be living on your floor
But the rents are high 
And LA's easy

Oh, it's a picture of perfection
Ah, and the postcards gonna read
""Fuck yeah we can live like this...
We can live like this""

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains 
And write it's so much fun out here

Hey Madeline (hey Madeline)
You sure look fine (you sure look fine)
You wore my favorite sweater
Being poor was never better
A safety buzz (A safety buzz)
Some cheap red wine (Some cheap red wine)
Oh, the trouble we can get in 
So let's screw this one up right

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd lie and tell our friends
It's so much fun out here
But when it's all over
I'll come back for another year

When it's all over 
I'll come back for another
When it's all over 
I'll come back for another year",2005
Heaven for the Weather,The Streets,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/streets/heavenfortheweather.html,"I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

There's something in the sun this day, I feel it 
Or maybe it's just my hay fever 
The weeds are green, the sky is shining 
But it'll soon be night which is nicer 
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room 
And the devil gestures to you 
You've never seen such a Beelzebee 
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening 
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out 
What do you make of this doubt? 
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up 
Easy - I know what my speech should be 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

The devil beams a big beaming grin 
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin 
He holds up paperwork - sign the line 
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine 
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet 
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreat 
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin 
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin 
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars 
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating - 
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

You tell the devil in no uncertain terms 
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned 
What is this evil? And who decides this? 
When left to devices some humans try shit 
This is the reason we should all be tied up? 
We're just normal people exploring our minds 
We don't go around here putting poison in wine 
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right 
People are intricate, people aren't swines 
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds 
Sign on the line 
You sign on the line 
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me",2008
Rocket,Goldfrapp,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldfrapp/rocket.html,"Starting something, thought it could be fun
I started something, couldn't go wrong

Danger, heartache, I'd always knew
There's no winner, in this game you lose

But I still wanna know how she got in the door uninvited

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back

This is secrets, stories unfold
Flow by pleasure, losing control

Danger, heartache, something has died
No good pretending, I'm leaving this time

But I still wanna know how she got in the door uninvited

Oo-ooh I got a rocket

When Did Your Heart Go Missing?,Rooney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rooney/whendidyourheartgomissing.html,"Love don't come so easily
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
I have you and you have me
We're one in a million
Why can't you see?

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing, yeah?

I meant every word I said
I never was lying when we talked in bed
I'm retracing every step in my head
What did I miss back then?
I was so, so misled

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?

I don't understand
How could you forget what we had,
It's so wrong

I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?

I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?

Yeah!

Things were so good
We had a little dream
A little dream together
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
But you disappeared on me
And your heart, your heart went missin'
I don't know how to find it
I don't know where it is
I don't know where your heart went
It was here just the other day
Now it's gone
I'm gonna call the police
Call the investigator, the heart investigator",2007
Tick of Time,The Kooks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kooks/tickoftime.html,"Oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as im here.....

Its far too early in the morning to be trying to call you
And far too early in the daytime to be thinking about that

But I, (but I), but I, (but I), but I am

What did i do in a past life, oh to deserve this
Yeah the way I make myself
He's far too innocent to be a part of such a cruel world
And it is, and it is and it is

And so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.
Hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine,
Get off this situation and feel fine.

What did i do to deserve her love,
I have to ask myself.
When i am such a bad man but only to her (only to her, only, only to her)

Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.

Whisper words in her ear,

You Owe Me an IOU,Hot Hot Heat,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hothotheat/youowemeaniou.html,"He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change

Tight fisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him 
that talk is even cheaper told in bulk
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder 
He'd never change

And so she yelled at him: 

You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time

She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change

Overtly individual - covertly traditional
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change

And so he yelled at her:

But, I'll act as if it is
What's our deal? I don't know
But, I'll act as if it is what I think that it is
If it is, then this might just work

They were in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, they never quite knew what they had

And behave like we're trippin'

Go get dolled-up
And I'll pick you up.

There's no line for you and me

I see that twinkle in your eye,
You shake that ass and I just die,

Tomorrow doesn't matter.
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one who can get me on my feet.
And I can't even dance.

Just look at me, Silly Me,
I'm as happy as can be-
I got a girl who thinks I rock.
And tomorrow there's no school,
So lets go drink some more Red Bull,
And not get home 'till about 6:00.

When I'm dancing with you
Tomorrow doesn't matter.
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one who can get me on my feet.

Everybody here is staring
At the outfit that you're wearing-

Cover's only twenty bucks,
And even if the DJ sucks
It's time to turn this mutha out!

When we're together [x2]
There's no tomorrow [x2]
No Tomorrow.
When we're together
There's no one in the world

Just you and me.

I look myself in the eye
There's no-one there
I fall upon the earth
I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare

I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo doo

I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbit's tail

I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there
Bungee jumping, I don't care

Doo, doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doo
Life, doo, doo doo

So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one

If you really want to

Sometimes living out your dreams
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world
In a beautiful balloon

Depending in which land
You may find yourself.

Everybody is a part of everything anyway,
You can have everything if you let yourself be.

Rainbows in the Dark,Tilly and the Wall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tillyandthewall/rainbowsinthedark.html,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naÃ¯ve son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
We finally had front-page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the colour's so vibrant , the colour's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river

Hold Music,Architecture in Helsinki,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/architectureinhelsinki/holdmusic.html,"Hey you know my friend lisa
she's down from LA
we've been places like this
there always the same
we'll loosen the rope just enough to make you pay
when my memory is hazy
we're moving away
to rent a display home
avoid all the grey
2 bees in a storm
the honey's stuck us by the hair

hold music
give it to me baby don't you dare lose it

when we're sleeping in daily
there's ice on the road
I bought us a dragon
to lighten the load
he's keeping us warm
the blood keep flowing to your head
Say I've never been stately
I'm legless at sea
my spirit has felt you since 1903
I'm trying to be normal
but there's evil in my head

hold music
give it to me bay don't you dare lose it

You're so dangerous
everybody's gonna hide out back
it doesn't matter that you're serious
move along sad face your cover's blown
cmon there you are
and we're outta space and you're out of space
change the beat fast
or your enemies will see you naked

hold music hold music hold

When we were out drinking
I found you a home
4 million in prizes
you left me alone
when we were forlorn
I found some poison in your bed
Though you may mistake me
I'll never be free
I'm stuck in the crossfire
between you and he
tattoos on his arms
he got a needle for a head

hold music
give it to me bay don't you dare lose it",2007

I'm lightning on my feet

People Should Smile More,Newton Faulkner,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newtonfaulkner/peopleshouldsmilemore.html,"People should smile more
I'm not saying there's nothing to cry for
And you've got
Everything laid out for you
Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start another war
Keep buying, keep moving
This city, is sitting
Next to me
We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain

I can't change the world
'Cause trying to make a difference
Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people should smile more

And people should smile more
But the lights are so bright that they blind you
Just one more
Meaningless scientific breakthrough
The more we know, the less we care, what's damaged on the way
Keep moving, keep buying
This city, is sitting
Next to me
We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain

I can't change the world

Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people could smile more

English Tea,Paul McCartney,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulmccartney/englishtea.html,"Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea
Very twee
Very me
Any sunny morning

What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes
Fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

Miles and miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

Do you know the game croquet
Peradventure we might play
Very gay
Hip hooray
Any sunny morning

Miles and miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost suppertime
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning",2005

The Boy Does Nothing,Alesha Dixon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aleshadixon/theboydoesnothing.html,"I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go go go

I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go go go

[CHORUS x2:]
Does he wash up?
He never wash up
Does he clean up?
No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up?
He never brushed up
He does nothing
The boy does nothing

Hey boy
How you been?
I got a thousand lines
Where do I begin?
And I
I been here, been there
Traveling
I saw you at the corner
My vibe kicked in
And
Two fields
I clock you
Wearing tight jeans
A real nice suit
He was smiling like you
Was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance
He said 'yes please'

Take a sip of dancing juice
Everybody's onto you
Through the left and to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm
It's on tonight
I'm gonna feel the heat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

[CHORUS x2]

Work it out now
Work it, Work it out now

Do the mumbo
Shake it all around now

Everybody on the floor
Let me see you clap your hands

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

Must Have Done Something Right,Relient K,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/relientk/musthavedonesomethingright.html,"We should get jerseys 'cause we make a good team

I spend with you is the new best day of my life

It's jealously, they can see that we've got it going on

I'm racking my brain for a new, improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're okay with the way this is going to be
'Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen

If anyone can make me a better person, you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
I came along one day, and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right

Maybe I'm just lucky, 'cause it's hard to believe
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
That we have got something real good going on

And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're okay with the way this is going to be

Super Honeymoon,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/superhoneymoon.html,"Glamour and fashion
Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember
She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air

So lovely...
She was everything to me

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault...
She was a gymnast, happily swinging
On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run

Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

As for compensation, there's a little he will ask
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.

But, oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
It sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine

To get through to the man in me.",1970

I'm just a girl in the world...
That's all that you'll let me be!

(Just Like) Starting Over,John Lennon,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/justlikestartingover.html,"Our life together is so precious together,
We have grown - we have grown,
Although our love is still special,
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone,

It's been so long since we took the time,
No-one's to blame,
I know time flies so quickly,
But when I see you darling,
It's like we both are falling in love again,
It'll be just like starting over - starting over,

Everyday we used to make it love,
Why can't we be making love nice and easy,
It's time to spread our wings and fly,
Don't let another day go by my love,
It'll be just like starting over - starting over,

Why don't we take off alone,
Take a trip somewhere far, far away,
We'll be together all alone again,
Like we used to in the early days,
Well, well, darling,

It's been so long since we took the time,
No-one's to blame,
I know time flies so quickly,
But when I see you darling,
It's like we both are falling in love again,
It'll be just like starting over - starting over,

Our life together is so precious together,
We have grown - we have grown,
Although our love is still special,
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone.",1980

Ageless Beauty,Stars,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stars/agelessbeauty.html,"Ageless beauty
Cruelty makes its holes
But on the shoreline
Time will hold its promise
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
Tattered fingers
Lingering on the warm and foolish
Hardened faces
Graceless, we'll lose the battle
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
Oceans won't freeze
So loosen your heart
Underestimated
Undefeated in this love

Song Against Sex,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neutralmilkhotel/songagainstsex.html,"And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, ""Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string""
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream - 
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind 
So I'm always sober
Always aching 
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you...
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving - 
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.",1996
Sunny Afternoon,The Kinks,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kinks/sunnyafternoon.html,"The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime

Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze

Grass,Animal Collective,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animalcollective/grass.html,"Well, I was walking on feet just like my fathers
And my knees were trying to reach you at your mother's
'Cause my nose was screaming that you smelled like a lover
But my hands were happy to treat you like a brother, then

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!

I've been into the plants and simple treasures
And I sew patches on pants and I'll get pleasure
And I don't make particular plans 'cause they don't matter
If you keep on foolin' in bed with my sleeping patterns, and

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!

What's with all the changes since the time I was aware
It's like the apple eating people that we once were aren't there
Did they empty out their pockets and debase their younger faces
And you must make sure you're happy when you leave your summer places

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair there
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

I was very nervous how I felt in there
I was very cautious what'd you say
Hey there

Would you like to see me often?
Though you don't need to see me often
'Cause I'd like to see you often
Though I don't need to see you often

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?

Keep taking it easy.
This time it's not personal.
The universe will help you now.
To find a place you can breathe.
And do what you've got to do.
Keep taking it easy.
Keep taking it easy.
Come on.
I'll let you borrow my four leaf clover.
Come on.
Take it with you, you can pass it on.
Come on.
You know I'm not the kind to say that it's over.
We'll be rubbing shoulders once again in the sun.
Come on.
Take your dreams, where nobody can find them.
Come on.
You know I won't be happy till you've won.
So come on.
Come on over, borrow my clover.
Is there anything left that you haven't done?
Go on do what you've got to do.

Bones,The Killers,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/bones.html,"Come with me.

We took a back road.
We're gonna look at the stars.
We took a backroad in my car.
Down to the ocean,
itâs only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands.

But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, but on a heartbeat glide.

Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold, wet dirt I cry.
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry.

Donât you wanna come with me? Donât you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
It's only natural.

A cinematic vision ensued
like the holiest dream.
It's someone's calling?
An angel whispers my name,
but the message relayed is the same:
âWait till tomorrow,
you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind.
I always hear them
when the dead of night
comes calling to save me from this fight.
But they can never wrong this right.

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
It's only natural.
Donât you wanna swim with me? Donât you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?

What's My Age Again?,blink-182,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blink182/whatsmyageagain.html,"I took her out. It was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops, and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is Call ID?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

That's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never wanna act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Rewritten by machine on new technology

I met your children
What did you tell them?

We can't rewind, we've gone too far

You were the first one
You were the last one

We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near

Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

Everyone likes to dance to a happy song
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart
Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art

I'm 'a do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

No, I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

I'm 'a do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think",2008
If It Makes You Happy,Sheryl Crow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/ifitmakesyouhappy.html,"I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos,
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, o.k. I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

[Chorus]
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, o.k. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

[Chorus]

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between
Well, o.k. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

[Chorus]",1996
All Day Long I Dream About Sex,JC Chasez,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jcchasez/alldaylongidreamaboutsex.html,"So you wanna be a rockstar
Keep it going, don't stop
Work it while you're on top, call the cops

Rollercoaster riding, baby
Up and down
I love to watch you do it

I just want to get close to you
Find out what it takes to move you

Feel the rhythm, hit the spot, getting hot
All night long

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

Keep in mind, I'm a love machine
Get it twenty four seven, call me any time you need

Some extra attention, did I forget to mention
School's back in session, get ready for a lesson

I just want to feel alive
And do what it takes to satisfy you

Hour after hour baby
All night long with you

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you",2004
Ugly,Sugababes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sugababes/ugly.html,"When I was 7
They said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was OK
They said you're more beautiful
And that's the way they show that they wish
That they had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous cos

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
Cos I didn't know my body would change
I grew taller than them in more ways
But there will always be the one who will say
Something bad to make them feel great

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
So are you
So are you

Everybody talks bad about somebody
And never realises how it affects somebody
And you bet it won't be forgotten
Envy is the only thing it could be

Cos people are all the same
(The same, the same)
And we only get judged by what we do
(What we do, yeah, yeah)
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
(Yeah, you)
So are you
So are you

People are all the same
(Oh, oh, oh)
And we only get judged by what we do
(What we do, yeah)
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then
(Yeah, so are you)
So are you
So are you",2005

Free Ride,Edgar Winter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edgarwinter/freeride.html,"The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go
So I've come here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land, so

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and stand here by my side
Come on and take a free ride

All over the country, I've seen it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers must come from within, so

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and stand here by my side
Come on and take a free ride

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
